100602,"I'm not sure if I'm considered a superficial or realistic woman but there is something that has been bothering me ever since I started using dating apps. I recently matched this guy on tinder. He doesn't look tall or at least above average height but what caught my attention was his serious look, charismatic/distinctive look, his intelligence and he is pretty buff too. After chatting with him for some time, I noticed that we have a lot in common and what's more important is that he not only does pretty well in his field of expertise but he also has some side hustle that generates passive income. So when we first met each other, he indeed doesn't look tall, which I already expected but then when we were standing closer, I noticed that he is actually much taller than me (I'm 1.55m), like legit above 1.7m so I just casually asked him how tall he is, and he said he's 1.75m. I was like wow, it's unbelievable cos my expectation is just 1.7. For some reason he really looks short from far. I'm not sure is it due to his muscular arms, huge upper body frame and bulky legs. I mean who doesn't want a muscular bf right, but as much as I enjoy being with a buff dude, I sometimes care about how others view him cos even I find him short. We actually met up a few times. I'm not gonna lie, but he really looks short when he's in shorts. Should I continue dating him cos I really like a lot of his qualities and his height probably won't matter much to me later in life, or should I stop wasting his time since he looks short but isn't actually short?-#100602: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100602","['Haha: 69 people', 'Like: 19 people']",135 comments,10 shares
100595,"TLDR: Community Isolation Facilities are poorly planned and unhygienic I am a work permit holder from Malaysia and I was recently tested positive for COVID-19. For my housemates' safety, I opted to recover at MOH's assigned shared recovery facilities. This is my experience thus far: - I was not informed beforehand where and what kind of environment I will be doing my recovery at; I only knew where I was going when the assigned driver picked me up- According to the driver, all of the work permit holders, including me, are all sent to Community Isolation Facilities (CIF) while Singaporeans and PRs are sent to hotels- You are not allowed to transfer out of CIF even if you call MOH regardless of how bad the environment is- My CIF is located at Kranji, the facilities here are awful- You share an open space room with 9 other patients, not to mention that the rooms are not properly segregated from one another. The ceilings are covered by some kind of mosquito net- Everyone in the room is on different days/stages of recovery. Some of them have been staying in the room for a few days before a newly infected person moves into the room to take over an empty slot. How does MOH expect us to fully recover in this kind of environment? - The toilets here are small, the toilet bowl is less than 10cm away from the door, the shower head is right beside the door and almost directly above the toilet bowl, you have nowhere to hang your clean clothes as they will be splashed by the water eventually.- I called MOH hotline and asked why are we not allowed to choose our Isolation venue even if we are willing to pay. The staff said that the venues were assigned beforehand so we can't choose- I told the staff on the phone that being in this kind of environment is mentally taxing, and asked her if this is how MOH treats work permit holders. She replied that it isn't true as there are also Singaporeans and PRs assigned to CIFs (this is totally bullshit, everyone here holds a work permit, no Singaporeans and PRs here at all)We didn't choose to get infected with COVID-19, and yet this is how MOH treats us, as if it is a punishment. I feel blatantly discriminated as a work permit holder and I am extremely disheartened with the treatment given by Singapore, a supposedly First World Country. I am aware that the recovery facility is a “benefit” for us, but I find that this environment makes it harder for people to recover properly. I hope MOH can do something about this, especially now that there is a new variant of the virus.-#100595: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100595","['Like: 8 people', 'Haha: 4 people', 'Angry: 2 people']",0 Comments,12 comments
100603,"TLDR - what happened to the OBAR at NUS staff club?I graduated from NUS in 2019. Since then, it's been about 2 and half years, easing into the routine of working life, definitely in an unforgettable manner so far with Covid messing up life as most of us have known it to be.Ever since Covid hit I have not visited NUS, so I dont know what has changed there. Recently though, I was drinking with a friend at a place called Obar at Pasir Ris Downtown East. I thought the name sounds very familiar - and after googling, I realised that indeed, Obar NUS was where I had a memorable celebration right after my Commencement in 2019, which took place in the evening. It was a joyful night, without work worries and a time when the nightmares of Covid had yet to begin.What has happened to that Obar NUS? It is no longer featured in the Obar website, so I assume it closed down... :((-#100603: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100603",['Like: 2 people'],1 comment,2 shares

100589,"TLDR; How do I get out of a traumatic experience emotionally, when I seem to be acting all fine? Prof Ben and seniors who studied psychology, please help advise a lost soul here. I just got out of a 5-6 months long internship that was extremely toxic. Probably because it's a startup, the company is short on manpower and responsibilities of staff are blurred. As such, I'm always expected to juggle multiple responsibilities and take initiative to do beyond what was asked. Just a note though, these responsibilities are not your typical ""pour coffee"" or ""sweep the floor"" etc. They are actual jobs that bring in revenue for the company. And yes, you probably guessed it, I actually managed to earn more than enough revenue to cover my own salary (and much more actually). With the commercial nature of these jobs, I'm constantly stressed out to deliver nothing less than my best. Because I know that if anything goes wrong, it's my fault. It doesn't help that I have a deep sense of responsibility towards every job that I'm assigned. So even as an intern, I expect myself to exhaust all means in ensuring that things go smoothly. Rare for an intern to feel this? Maybe, idk, but maybe this just made the traumatic experience become more traumatic. Why? 1. Some of these jobs are questionable. As in I don't even know whether there will be any legal consequences. Whether it's relevant to my course is another thing, but I guess that's slightly less concerning than this legal part. 2. My supervisor.. hais.. I can't talk about him without having a trigger of some sort (never had any issues with my emotions before this internship, and I'd consider myself to be v aware of my feelings) At his best (usually when he has something to ask from me), he'll talk normally, sometimes even amicably. He has this weird charm that makes people want to continue talking to him. Unfortunately, that's part of the reason why I decided to come on board. So much for thinking that I know myself, when I can't even foresee the misery he's going to inflict upon me in time to come. At his worst (which is most of the time), he'll just talk down to me, raise his voice at me (in front of everyone in the office, though it's not a lot of ppl lar, but still..), or even threaten to terminate my internship early. It's extremely toxic to the point where he'll start picking fault at the little things I do / have. And yes, he made it v personal in those personal attacks. One interesting thing about one of the things he said: He loves to downplay the importance of the things that I've done / am doing, so he probably treats me like a normal intern right? But no, once when he was threatening to terminate my internship early, he implied that the company is treating me more than an intern, by giving me freedom to explore ways of doing things (excuse for their lack of guidance / resources maybe? - afterall, he mentioned that I was supposed to come in to help another staff, which ""happened"" to prefer doing things by himself/herself after I come in) and whatnot. He also said that interns are like soldiers, ask them to go die, they can't say no (I rly can't tell if he's kidding, since I'm alrdy v afraid of him at this point). So does he see me as an intern, or does he not see me as an intern? Or does he treats me unimportantly like an intern (he lacks basic respect when talking to me), pays me like an intern (v low pay, which is expected for an intern), but expects me to perform complex jobs like a normal employee? I've learned in school that hardly anything is fast, cheap and good. While he wants all of these, he's not willing to treat me with basic respect. In case you were wondering why I still worked tirelessly for the company, and why I suppress my negative emotions in front of them (even though someone here repeatedly caused it), it's because I have this deep sense of responsibility in me. I don't feel that it's professional to let my emotions get in the way of my work. As a result of all these, I'm now extremely traumatised by this experience. This is the first time I've felt so helpless and lost in my life. It doesn't help that on the surface, I'm a v cheerful person who doesn't seem to mind his repeated verbal abuse. Deep down, I know that something is off, but I'm just so good at suppressing these emotions that I no longer know how to deal with it. I know that something is off because I seem to be experiencing all 5 stages of grief all at once (yes I do blame myself sometimes because I chose this company over others). I am also losing interest in things I used to enjoy, losing my appetite, having nightmares of him, having my mind drift off without me realising immediately (I know that this is potentially dangerous, but I really don't know how to solve this..) , having random memory loss, having random panic attacks etc. I'm extremely afraid of having PTSD because of this. The last thing I want is to be affected by this incident for the rest of my life. I am already at the losing end, and I really want to get out of this emotional rut. It's v dark and scary here. Anyone with psychological advice / similar experience, could you please help me -#100589: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100589","['Like: 10 people', 'Care: 10 people', 'Sad: 4 people']",19 comments,1 share

100585,"(*Admin please post this. Thank you)Hi all. I'm a female in late 20s, single, poly graduate and have few years of IT work experience. I am currently pursuing a part-time degree.After working for few years, I took a few months break and went for job-hunt wanting to do something different aka job that is more fulfilling/fun (something I wanted to try out) but pay is lesser.  Eventually I ended up working in IT related job now as the pay is more based on my past experience and I needed the money to pay for my school fees and own living expenses.However at the back of my mind, I been thinking whether I should (Choice A): go try different jobs (lower pay) and if need be, to work few different jobs to supplement the income. As I do enjoy having the experience in life to try out different jobs since I am still (considerably) young and I do not have a clear goal/passion what I want to do in life so this can kinda be a period for me to explore and enrich my life. (Fyi The jobs that i would like to explore are not corporate jobs or jobs that deemed to pay well)Also since most jobs require a degree and even with my past IT work experience, it is not able to allow me to earn relatively high pay in IT jobs too; much less change of industry (eg to a business/marketing job etc) as the pay will even be lower or I might not even be accepted with my qualification. So I have been thinking during my course of study (around 2 years), whether I should just use this time as like a ""explore"" period and after graduating with degree, will pursue a more ""corporate""/stable job that pays more as I would then have the paper qualification and some amount of IT work experience.Or on the other hand, if I should just stick to (Choice B): continue working in this current IT job. To earn the money and build on the related work experience to put on the resume (aka it will be better working on similar area instead of a choppy resume?) Also since I am about to reach 30, it would be more practical to do something more ""stable"" to build on the finances and corporate work experience.Thank you for reading this!

100045,"F here who believes that maintaining ""strictly professional"" interactions with friends of the opposite gender, while being in a serious relationship, should be a responsibility everyone should impose on themselves.It is now quite fashionable to promote the idea that ""you don't have to cut ties with platonic friends of the opposite gender once you get into a serious relationship."" But I think people get the logic entirely wrong sometimes. This has nothing to do with trust or distrust, it has everything to do with risk management.It is never socially acceptable to insist that your partner has to cut ties with his/her friends of the opposite gender, just as it is never socially acceptable for a guy to insist that a girl has to wear conservative clothing in order to prevent herself from being sexually assaulted. I think most people are on the same page about these things.But risks being risks, they honestly do not care what is socially acceptable and what isn't. If you have many close friends of the opposite gender, the risk of your being unfaithful cannot possibly be lower than if you only hung out with friends of the same gender. Same goes with wearing only a sports bra at MacRitchie at 9PM. This has nothing to do with victim blaming. If you put yourself at risk, you put yourself at risk. It's easy to say ""men should stop raping."" It's just as easy to say ""my dog should stop humping the sofa all the time."" Just because we made something illegal doesn't automatically alter our biology.Since becoming a mom, I have abstained from activities I used to love doing in my early twenties, most notably, mountain biking (from which I have sustained several severe injuries in the past). It's not that I don't trust myself to be careful. When you deal with things that are completely out of your control, it stops being an issue of trust. It just becomes an issue of your being stupid for taking unnecessary risks.I have male friends. But I have always made it a point to tell my husband whenever I hang out with any of them. He doesn't require them but it gives me more peace to know he is at peace.

I am a department head and ometimes I feel sorry for my young staff. To expect someone to constantly improve themselves just to stay employed (not talking about getting a raise or promotion) is just mentally and emotionally draining.

My worry is that I'll have to start my real SWE career from scratch (effectively wasting six year of my life), or even worse, be unhirable for entry-level SWE role due to my age and lack of real experience.I'll just say that I cannot afford to break my bond (mid six figures), so that is not an option.

There is nothing better that he sees in me? I do like him a lot, but honestly I was a little hurt. Had hope that he likes more of the inner me.

100572,"I am not sure where to start. Would like to get this story off my chest and let’s see what people here has to say. It has been around 4 years since graduation. I used to have friends whom we hang out together almost every day after school, mugging in the libraries, going for CCAs together, we joke around a lot. They were friends I cherish a lot. After graduation, we went out once or twice to hang out. Thereafter, I tried to ask them out again, or even just asking getting an update about their life over whatsapp. And I start getting no response from them. As if they are actually not keen to meet up/hang out. Or…are they just really busy with life? I really question, what actually went on? Or, were we never really true friends to begin with? I have been thinking whether to raise the questions again. But, it has been so long since we last spoke… it just feels abit awkward and even if we meet, it wouldn’t feel the same as before anymore.-#100572: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100572","['Like: 29 people', 'Sad: 10 people', 'Care: 5 people']",45 comments,11 shares

100570,"Hi all, would like to seek some advice:A month ago I accompanied a family member (age 59) for a routine medical check and was told that his cholesterol level was high (4.3mmol/l). At that point, the Dr had recommended exercise and a healthy diet to manage the cholesterol level.3 days ago, we went for another check-up (skin allergy) at the same gov healthcare facility, and another Dr, based on the previous reading of 4.3mmol/l,  immediately prescribed statins. We are hesitant as to whether to start on statins because:-not sure if really necessary at this point, considering what the previous Dr said about exercise and diet-fearful of the well-known side effects -worried about having to be on statins for life since it cannot be stopped once started Are there any natural remedies to lower the cholesterol level?Any advice will be much appreciated.

100569,"I am a married woman who has been in a relationship with a wonderful guy for the last decade. We are regarded as the ""golden couple"" by many friends and acquaintances. We work in the same field. We are financially stable, and this has allowed us to spend on novel experiences. I believe that this has prevented our relationship from ""stagnating"". He has numerous positive attributes - kind, caring, patient and supportive. I feel that he is close to an ideal husband. Unfortunately, I can't help but feel guilty for events that have happened in the last year. At the start of the year, I met a younger coworker. I was going through a difficult time at work and I usually use humour as a coping mechanism. Hence, I was joking around a lot (not in a flirty way). Besides, because he was new and I was his senior, I was initially helping him out quite a bit. I sensed that he was starting to develop some interest in me (eg. gifting me a box of chocolates a few days prior to valentine's day) but I brushed it off as me overthinking. I had told him very early on that I was married. Eventually, he asked me out to hang out after work, which I declined very awkwardly. We managed to get past the awkwardness by pretending that nothing happened. However, I, too, started to develop a crush on him because I felt that we were on the same wavelength and we could talk about anything. There was this undeniable sexual tension between us and I was having sexual fantasies about him. It felt like I was a teenager again. We also started exchanging texts outside of office hours (nothing that will be considered as sexting, but still). I was very conflicted as to what I wanted from our relationship. I knew that, logically, there was no future if I were to pursue a romantic relationship with him. I also knew that I was never going to leave my husband. But at the same time, I just wanted to spend time with this coworker. Looking back, it was probably the thrill of the secrecy made me do it. Fortunately, my cheating never did progressed to the physical nature. He eventually left my department and we kept a bit of contact for a few months after. Eventually, the intervals between his texts grew longer and then he ghosted me. Logically, I knew that he was doing me a favour by cutting contact with me but it did hurt. It's been months since our last contact, but I still think about him, and I am still obsessed about him (our my idealised image of him). Now, he still going to join the department where my husband is working at, and my worlds are going to collide..-#100569: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100569","['Like: 59 people', 'Haha: 41 people', 'Wow: 10 people']",61 comments,10 shares
100567,"I really need to make a confession. it’s hurting me so badly and I sobbed myself to sleep every night. I (26F) am getting married soon and my bf (34M) is the nicest person I ever met. It doesn’t matter he is not so handsome and much older than me, he doesn’t earn a lot but he cares for me. The things we went through this pandemic period makes me know that he is Mr Right. But unlike most bride-to-be, I have this fear of choosing my gown because of a tattoo that run across my left breast. No one, not even my parent or sisters know about it. I used to have a boyfriend in my first year in university and he is a total jerk. There is so many hurtful incidents, so much things he do to me, I am glad I left him. One of the thing he force me to do it to tattoo his name across my breast. I didn’t want to but after weeks of persuasion I give in. It don’t seem to be too bad an idea at that point in time. But now I regret it so much and felt so stupid, angry with myself. Now I have to live with his name screaming across my breast, and its not a small tattoo either. My worst fear now is that my bf will found out about this when I dress in a low cut wedding gown, or in future if we are to see each other naked. How do I explain? How will he feel? Will he leave me?  Laser tattoo removal don’t seem to work well and will leave a scar. And my bf probably still will ask. Many of you will tell me to communicate properly with him, but I don’t believe he can accept it. Even if he said it is ok, I know that no guys can accept that his wife have the name of another man tattoo on their breast. What should I do?

Slowly I'm just feeling burned out, I realized this was not the life I wanted, seeing my single/ childless friends living the best years in their life, progressing in their careers, enjoying their freedom is just slowly eating into me. I love my family, I got a great understanding, a supportive and faithful wife, and an adorable, smart, and cheerful daughter, but I hate my life, the things I couldn't do, and the things I have to give up doing.I often hear people talk about the joy of parenting, but it's been almost 2 years and I still can't relate, don't get me wrong, I love my daughter, she means the world to me but I can't help but feel like I'm burning on both ends of the candle. My relationship with my wife has basically plateaued as well, it's basically the duties of a husband and a co-parent at this point, no sparks, no passion, no more butterflies.

In mu opinion, If you are in a committed relationship you should respect your partner and their wishes. I see it as guys being immature and those guys in general do not respect women as people and simply view these women as objects. It’s a habit that guys form that can turn into an addiction. It’s not healthy for the relationship and if it’s a problem should be discussed instead of brushing it off again as “ it’s just what guys do”. Social media and the internet have ruined relationships today for the most part. You don’t see people getting married and staying together for decades any longer. It’s unfortunate I think.

100561,"I (24F) recently did something stupid that I regret big time but I don't have the courage to share it with friends for fear of judgement etc. My boyfriend has been very busy the last few months with his own commitments, so I started using a dating app to entertain myself. I had done this on previous occasions and it never posed an issue because most matches fizzled out after a few days, typical of most dating apps. But this time I matched with this guy who was tall, smart, good looking, and seemed to be giving me the attention I craved. Barely a few weeks in and I started to crush on him really hard. It was that rush of adrenaline/serotonin/whatever from when you're just getting to know each other that I haven't felt in a long time. I wondered if he was worth leaving my boyfriend for.Well it turns out that guy was just playing me (I know, what's new right). At the beginning we were chatting the whole day about the most random things, and the conversation was so natural. I felt like we had a lot in common. Then all of a sudden he started to withdraw. I don't know how many girls he was talking to, I don't even know how much of what he told me was true. Thankfully we hadn't met (yet), but I'm the kind that gets emotionally attached so easily that I still can't let him go. I know this is my fault, I'm not even going to dispute the fact. He has essentially ghosted me but I still check my phone, hoping he will reply. Just saying this makes me feel like such a pathetic idiot. It backfired so spectacularly and I know I deserve it. The worst part is, I never thought I'd be a cheater. I've read so many other posts about people who cheated on their partners, and I'd be thinking ""serve you right"". I had this image in my mind of what a girl who cheats looks like, loud, popular, really hot. I am nothing like that, most people know me as very average-looking, introverted, 'morally upright' person- I don't think people would even believe me if I told them I cheated. Now I am in the uncomfortable place where my boyfriend doesn't have an inkling about what happened, but me being emotionally drained from thinking about another guy who doesn't give a shit, all while having to act like nothing happened. I just want to get over this. I'm so angry with myself for taking my boyfriend for granted for a fantasy. I guess the moral of the story is don't do stupid attention seeking things, and you never know what a cheater looks like.-#100561: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100561","['Like: 63 people', 'Haha: 41 people', 'Care: 11 people']",67 comments,19 shares

100540,"TLDR; Home is a living hell with a toxic, judgemental, attention-seeking and selfish mum. But I cannot get my own place because HDB policies discriminate singles. My mum is constantly unhappy because she is a housewife and is bitter that she has to do household chores daily. Over the years, we helped her with the chores but whenever we did so, she stood next to us and criticised our way of doing things from the start to the end. When we were done, she re-did everything immediately because she thinks that nobody can do the chores better than her. Eventually, all of us stopped helping her because she is going to redo them anyway. Why waste our time and effort? I suggested hiring a part-time helper (at my expense because I am working) but she flatly said no, because, ""Nobody can do the chores better than I do, and I will have to redo everything."" Fine. Since she thinks she is the best, she can do everything herself. Yet, she is bitter about having to do the chores and complains to relatives that nobody helps her and how tough her life is. She vents her bitterness by slamming things every waking moment. She does not put things down properly but throws them on the floor/table instead. She slams things early in the morning while we are still sleeping. I work super long hours and I do not get adequate rest because of her early morning slamming. I wear ear plugs to sleep but her slamming is still audible. I am WFH because of Covid and she continues to slam things throughout the day, disrupting my focus at work when I don't already have enough rest. I brought this up to her and she did not think she can improve herself; instead she thinks that she has every right to do what she wants because it is her house. She reacted by slamming things even more loudly. A close relative who knows about the situation talked to her as well, but all she replied was, ""I am like this, take it or leave it."" What a selfish human being. Besides her toxic antics, she is an attention-seeker. Since I was young, she regurgitates a few times a day, very loudly, just to get our attention. Obviously, nobody cares about her. She likes to have very dramatic actions and have exaggerated reactions to everything just to get attention. When bad things happen due to her own doing, she blames everyone except herself. She even blames it on supernatural forces. She is also bitter that her friends stay in condos or own cars and is always complaining that they don't deserve all these. Who is she to judge others? It's not that my family is poor. We lead a comfortable life, just that her friends are probably more well-to-do. I am in my 30s and still single while her friends' children are mostly married with kids at my age. She compares me to them and thinks I am a disgrace to her. All her toxicity, judgemental and attention-seeking antics are super repulsive. Many times I just wish she will get Covid and die. I hate it that her actions influenced me greatly and I grew up behaving exactly like her. It was only in my late 20s that I realised this and have been trying my best not to be the person I hate, to be a better person every day. But this almost 2 years of getting stuck at home with her every day is driving me crazy. My hatred for her grows day by day. I dread my life. You may ask, since I am so miserable, why don't I just move out of the house? Yes I very much want to but the HDB policy discriminates singles. I have to either rent a place (which does not make financial sense at all) or buy a private property, a luxury which I do not need. All I can do is wait a couple of years till I am 35 to get my own HDB flat.

I have a traditional mindset as I am brought up in a typical conservative asian family whereby shotguns marriages or sex before marriage are highly disapproved. My parents will never allow me to sleepover at his place, travel or go for staycation with my bf as she is the conservative type. As a couple, we have talked about it and sex is definitely off my boundaries. While I do have my urges at times, we only engage in heavy petting and bj. There are times where I feel like I want more than that but my conscious mind will pull me back when things go astray. I have never done it with any of my exes and I feel like it is a sacred thing to only give it to someone I see a future with and of course when we are ready to settle down i.e marriage, because there are so many consequences to think about, like getting pregnant (condom is not 100% safe and I dont wish to be on the pill). While my bf has no complaints about it and is fine with no sex, just hj and bj, I just cant help but feel guilty as I cannot give him anything more at this point and I know most guys definitely wants it often.

Now, we have been dating for 1.5 years and recently purchased a house together.Our rs has been going smoothly and we are still pretty loving. However, there's just one problem that has been on my mind for months now. I'm not sure if my boyfriend is sexually attracted to me. We probably had sex for <10 times over the course of our relationship - most of it happened during the start of our rs, and the last time was probably 5-6 months ago. 1) He is very busy at work and often work really long hours (>12hrs a day). Sometimes he claimed that he's tired, and okay, I can accept that.2) The last few times we had sex, we both agreed that it was pretty good. But if I recalled correctly, he was a little bit reluctant the last time when we had sex. 3) Both of us are aware that I have a higher sex drive than him, or maybe probably my job just isn't as demanding as his.4) I think that I'm slightly above average looking, and so is my boyfriend. I do put in effort to dress well, put on make up when we do head out, and I also exercise regularly. 5) When we do shower together, I noticed that he did not even get hard. So, I'm not sure why he's not keen on having sex? I have the typical assumption that men tend to have higher libido, and would be keen to have sex if the opportunity arises. But it doesn't seem like the case for my boyfriend. While sex isn't super duper important to me, I can't help but to be insecure and think that I'm no longer sexually attractive to him anymore (whilst he still loves me). And FYI, I do not think that he'd have time to be pursuing other women/ getting it out there, as his work is really busy.

I don't have any issues with that, except for the fact that we are also planning to visit our home country in a couple of months where we will meet his parents too, of course.I asked him when we are going to anyway meet them in a couple of months, why do they need to come here now? Isn't that not an intelligent use of money ?When I told him this, he said that his parents coming here and we going to meet them are different in the way that when they come here they get to travel to a foreign destination, see Singapore and stay with their son & daughter-in-law for a few days.He says giving his parents this joy is of great importance to him and it is not something that he wants to look at with the eyes of ""money"".However, I am unable to come to terms with this and I feel it is an useless expense when we are already planning a trip to visit them.Any thoughts? Is there something I can do/say to make my husband see my point of view ?Or am I thinking wrong ?-#100533: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100533","['Like: 42 people', 'Haha: 24 people']",99 comments,6 shares

100532,"Dear Prof Ben, I would like to seek your advice. I have a loving husband, however, he gets overly sensitive and hurt easily. I do understand that my facial expression, tone, etc could have hurt him unintentionally, and I have also intentionally willed myself to be more sensitive. However there are some days where I have accidentally carelessly hurt him with say harsher tone etc. To be honest, it is also quite tiring to keep willing myself intentionally to care and spare a thought for his feelings. It feels a little like walking on thin thread, fearful of how and what I say could have hurt him. He is really an excellent and loving husband, and I would like to learn how else can I show sensitivity to my husband apart from facial expression, tone, etc? Does practice really makes it perfect?-#100532: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100532","['Like: 17 people', 'Care: 2 people']",13 comments,1 share
100531,"I have something that is rather concerning and would like input from you guys and perhaps Prof Ben.My mom is 70 this year and I noticed that her mood or views towards certain tend to be more extreme and she seems to be more impatient compared to the past. One recent example was I merely shared with her a news article that young people nowadays prefer not to have kids and I was shocked she responded in an agitated manner “these selfish youngsters only care about enjoyment in their youth. They deserved to be stoned to death in those countries with Syariah laws!” A few years back, if she were to know of the same issue, the response although in disagreement with such trend, would only sound neutral “hmm then next time there won’t be next generation of talent to replace the aging population”. Another example is whenever I shared with her about my day at work or some issues I faced, she gets impatient generally or even tone became agitated if the discussion stretched beyond 10 mins. In the past, she would patiently explain to me how I should deal with certain issues in the workplace and ensured I’m very clear about it. When things are fine, she’s perfectly ok. But it’s when she sees/hears things she dislike or opinion differs from hers, she started behaving in an agitated manner. I didn’t know what is causing her to lose her cool more easily nowadays.Some background info about my family. We’re a traditional Chinese family whereby my dad, in his 70s, is all along the breadwinner and my mom is a housewife. They’re married for around 40 years. Ever since their marriage, my dad, being a hot-tempered man, frequently verbally abuse my mom, though he never laid his hands on my mom. He provided well for the family, even when he had already retired. When I’m still schooling, there’re occasions whereby I told my mom to divorce my dad as I can’t stand how he verbally abused my mom. But her response will be she’s used to it already. Just treat him like singing lor. If divorce who’s going to pay for the bills? And so I thought my mom was really over it and didn’t think much about it. However, recently, perhaps due to the covid restrictions and all, my dad was really bored and it seems like his boredom is causing him to verbally abuse my mom even more, perhaps to vent his frustrations? For instance, everything that don’t go his way he’ll blame on my mom and say things like “knn cb! It’s all because of you lah!” Still my mom told me just one day pass one day lor, what to do? She just seems resigned to fate she had married such a man. At least to her, my dad can provide comfortably for the family good enough. The problem is I had just starting working and I don’t earn much, only enough my own expenses plus contribute some to household expenses. We still need my dad to pay the bills so reporting my dad for verbal abuse is not an option right now. I tried to talk to my mom about her change in behaviour to find out if there’s anything affecting her really badly deep down. However she’ll put the blame on things like it’s because I’m talking too much so she lose her cool, or she’ll blame other factors like it’s because those youngster or any other issues she disagreed with deserved her wrath. My mom seems like a changed person compared to a few years ago and she don’t seems to want to admit it. Why is it so challenging to talk to her about this change? Is the change in her behaviour a normal part of aging? Could anyone tell me what is likely the cause? And how would I be able to help get her back to what she once was eg cool and calm? Thank you in advance for advice offered.-#100531: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100531","['Like: 7 people', 'Care: 3 people', 'Sad: 2 people']",0 Comments,10 comments

100527,"As I was reading #100460, #99987, I knew I was not the only lone 171cm guy who felt short in Singapore.Some guys my height might say this is ok, blabla it is not short. Oh really? I wonder if they really stepped out of their house and carefully observe the guys and girls around them, especially strangers. Or are they hiding in their own shell and ownself comfort ownself?What makes it worse is those guys who claim they are short or have friends who are short. Really? I par par zao alot and the guys I carefully counted ( who are below 171cm ),  can be done with 1 hand. In fact I dont even remember the last time I saw a shorter guy. Most guys I see are humongous 180cm++ because my eye level is only at their shoulders. The netizens who claim they are really shorter than me should be punished for fake news! It is easy to say than proving it.If you really make a trip down to east coast, you will notice that even all those fitspo and biker ladies (yes gals...) are at least taller than 171cm. You wont even feel like a guy next to them. And yes... comparing with guys is out of league. Why I claim this is because I frequent East Coast often and I survey alot.So to those bright minds of nation, the medical doctors, do you know of any limb lengthening procedure that has a high success rate? My aim is to reach at least 185cm.-#100527: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100527","['Haha: 47 people', 'Like: 23 people', 'Sad: 5 people']",95 comments,5 shares
100518,"I would like to rant out a bit and ask for advice...Anyone know how should I go about forgetting someone? I have been in love with this guy (he's straight) for almost a year. We would frequently hang out together often to study / go out. I've always known that it would be impossible but I still wished that I can maintain the status quo as good friends.  Fast forward now (this semester), he met someone who he's interested and spends a lot of the time with her... We have been meeting and communicating less and less... Deep down, I knew that it was only a matter of time before this happens, but I can't help but feel the heartache and I'm not sure how should I stop it.Thinking back, I really should have stopped the moment I realised my feelings for him and that it is impossible.

100524,"Dealing with inferiority complex and insecurity with my partner. Posting here because I’m too ashamed to ask for advice irl.Back in NUS we were still equals. Both of us grew up in middle class, single parent households and frequently bonded over our similarities. We got along so well that just before he graduated, we decided to BTO and spend the rest of our lives together. Once he started working, he just kept rising up the corporate ladder. And when it was my turn to graduate and enter working life, my progression was just average, comparable to a typical graduate. And so here I am now, barely into my mid twenties and already having a quarter life breakdown. I know I’m blessed to have a stable job in this economic climate, but knowing that the salary I’m drawing is barely 1/3 of his is so demoralising. I’ve deeply thought about my feelings of inadequacy and reasoned that I’m not angry/sad that he is earning 5 figures. Like how can I blame the one I love for making so much? Honestly I’m v happy since he’s worked very hard to get to where he is now. Rather I’m just disappointed with myself for not being able to be on par with him? And for a long time now I’ve been afraid that he’ll start thinking I’m not good enough for him. And he’ll find someone richer, prettier or someone more capable than me  maybe not now but in the future :((At work I’m trying to be more active by taking up projects and developing new initiatives. I’m also pursuing a part time masters degree. Despite all of this I just know that I definitely won’t be able to reach his level of progression any time soon. Im feeling so depressed and have nightmares of him leaving me. A part of me wants to confide with him but im also scared that he will pity me or get the wrong idea that I’m upset with him. To some people it’s a laughable matter and that’s why im too embarrassed to talk about this with anyone. I think another factor which contributed to my trauma was my dad abandoning my mother when I was young. Has anyone ever felt this way before? How did you overcome it?

100521,"Sorry, long post, but no potato. I'm not sure if I should tell my bf something that happened before we got together. We're both recently graduated from NUS and we met in school in year 1. Everything has been smooth sailing except for a few arguments, but I feel like we worked through them okay albeit with way more effort than needed. Some issues that were involved my bf has always struggled with dealing with.So background is that I've officially been with him for the past 2years or so and we're planning on getting married maybe after our finances stabilise after all this COVID. Our relationship has been going ok and nothing major has happened, I just find him a bit immature for his age, but that's not really something I find ""major"" red flag or whatever.So the problem is that I found his secondary school class photo and we started talking about his secondary school life. Basically there's a guy in the photo that he's always insisted he ""doesn't remember"" even though they were from the same class, and he's never really talked about him. But he's clearly there in the class photo and his name is kinda unique so there's really no chance it's a case of mistaken identity. I guess you can sense how this is going.So my bf goes on a massive rant about how this guy made his life hell and how he really hates this guy (amongst other guys in his class). His class was like always split between several factions and he says while this guy was always on the side of the ""emo and weird"" side of class this guy never really stood up for him and it's just my bf that was left out. So my bf was left alone in class and taking shit from all of the cliques since he was alone. He also went to say something like this guy ""stole"" the girl he was going to ask out but after I found out a bit more it just seems like my bf never asked this girl out and wasn't really close to her whereas this other guy has known the girl for way longer and is actually like good friends with her. He also insisted his ""ex"" ""cheated"" on him with this guy, but it was pretty clear he and his ""ex"" weren't actually together...I also used to hook up with this same guy up till about a couple months before I met my bf, so while I thought they knew each other (being from the same school and all), my bf always denied knowing him or always said he can't remember, so I thought it was nothing important to mention. So the problem now is that I'm not sure whether to tell him I used to sleep with this guy? because like obviously if he eventually finds out it will be all sorts of problems and I don't want to deal with it after it blows up, preferably id want to avoid it.To make things worse I was pretty regularly ""involved"" with the other guy because the sex was mind-blowing and each session lasts way longer than average, and like this is something I know my bf will ask if I do tell him that I know this guy and have hooked up with him before... and I really don't want to lie about things because I feel like eventually things will get exposed anyway and it's just kicking the can down the road.But I don't want to hurt my bf, and like this is all in the past, but as I said my bf can be a little immature at times especially when it comes to these things - he's always been a bit spiteful about not being my first even though I'm not his first either? And if I didn't know better I'd say he's on his way to being an incel given all the ""stealing his girl"" narrative he's spewing rn and idk how to deal wit it.

100522,"I think that the TLDR version of the recent sexual harassment posts is that guys prioritise intention, girls outcome. For guys, if the intention is non-sexual (#100497: guy made bra comment because he thinks inappropriate for interview; #100509: guy made sex life comment because he thinks will affect office dynamics), then it is not S.H. For girls, if the outcome is sexual (#100497: girl was sexualized by calling her bra distracting; #100509: girl was sexualized by calling her promiscuous), then it is S.H.When I was in uni, one night I got terribly drunk and a guy friend helped me back to my hostel room. The last thing I remember before falling unconscious was vomiting all over myself. The next parts were from him: it was apparently 3+ in the morning so he doubted if anyone was still awake to help, but nevertheless he texted various female friends just in case. He also checked the entire floor to see if anyone was available. No luck with either apparently. So he decided to take off my clothes, wipe me clean, and put fresh clothes on me. He sent a text explaining what he did, which left me shocked when I read it next morning, because I checked and realized that he had changed my underwear too. I was deeply uncomfortable with the fact that he had seen and handled my naked body, but on the other hand he was a close friend and I knew him to be a gentleman, so I convinced myself he had no ulterior motives when he stripped me nude. Yet I couldn't shake off this feeling of discomfort, and our interactions became awkward afterwards (and non-existent since graduation). Was I sexually harassed? Is intention or outcome more important?-#100522: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100522","['Like: 27 people', 'Haha: 13 people', 'Wow: 5 people']",39 comments,1 share
100513,"I feel like I don't have any control over my own life. I am a 25 F, who still lives at home with my parents, like many others. Growing up, my mum is very strict + loving to me, which in combination turned me into a people pleaser + no backbone. Before going out, I need to tell her where I'm going, who I'm meeting, when I'll be home etc. I don't have a copy of the house keys either. I know I may sound spoilt to some but this level of micromanagement is really driving me insane. Got my hair cut recently and mum fave me the illusion of control, allowed me to pick my own hairstyle for the first time ever, wow I know. I picked it and I showed it to her, she gave an expression and said nothing. When I entered ths shop, she showed the stylist her photo instead. I had a small disagreement with her and she basically used the 苦肉计(pity card) on me and I just swayed because I don't like to fight with her.I used to have bad skin, like really bad and my mum brought me to all sorts of doctors. I reallt hated it becaude these doctors would get super close to my face and like stare. They's say ,""yours very bad eh"" or like ""I think yours is considered moderate to severe"" just to sell products. (For tmi: I never had cystic acne, just small red spots all around mt forehead and cheeks) It was my biggest insecurity. I wouldn't have cared if not for my mum pinpointing it all the time. ""Your skin is getting worse ah"" or ""Recently why your skin like dat?"" But now, I am comfortable and happy with my skin, I accept that it will never be perfect like hers. I learned not to panic every time I break out because of work stress or when my period is approaching. I just ride the wave yk? But my mum said ""why not I bring you to a new doctor. A lot of people say good one"". I started to cry because I didn't want to relive that experience. The last time I went, i had such a bad skin reaction to the oral meds they gave me that I had to wear a mask to classes, and this was pre covid... I explained to her but she wouldnt budge. She continued to talk, saying that this one is different (how would she know?) She said I was being ridiculous and dramatic, oversensitive. And then she went ahead to book an appointment for me and told me after the fact. Tired, I just said okay. I was complaining to my mum that I have noticed subtle changes to my body. I was sharing with her that I read that as you pass 25, your body goes through another small shift, almost like gearing up for motherhood. I told her I am a bit not used to the small changes like my hips are a bit wider even though I didn't gain any weight (I am 40+kg) . She started to say that I should work out and that that would solve the problem. I then explained, I wasnt looking for a solution, I am not fat, just not used to my new body, but she keeps cutting me off to say that I should join her for her gym runs and stuff. I told her that's not what I meant, I have lost weight in fact but my hips are just wider, and she jist doesnt let me finish. I told her I didn't want to work out with her because if I did, I wanted to do so alone and she had this hurt look and that made me feel bad. I just don't like her telling me how I am not pretty enough, or like not doing things right or like just being in my space for even longer periods of time yk? (Oh and she uses different ig influencers as reference as to why I should start a more rigorous work out regime, which is fair, but if I were to work out, I want to do it for myself, not because she told me to. I know that with any improvements, the credit would be self attributed to her)Might be because I am the only child and I was raised to never talk back to her. Now I find myself internally struggling more and more to suppress my tone and words. Truth is, I owe her right? Still living under her roof, she paid for my everything, she loves me. She always says ""I want what's best for you"" and part of it is ""I want to make you prettier because you are supposed to be at your peak now at this age"". It feels like she isn't satisfied with my looks, skin nor body. And after spending years trying to overcome those self depreciating voices in my head (that I have realised now were put in by my mother, the person who loves me the most), I can feel myself being shoved backwards. Whenever I speak my mind, and I say something against her, she passively accuses me of twisting her intentions, that all she wants is what's good for me. She never called me ugly, but I tell her that she makes me FEEL ugly. She says that I should appreciate her more because not all mothers would pay for aesthetic treatmenrs for their kids and that I was ungrateful.I'm tired and tbh, I know that the advice would be to move out / get married / speak my mind anyway / argue with her I think I am just venting here lol. I love her too much to ever contemplate leaving or ruining our relationship (she believes me moving out without getting married = me not being filial)-#100513: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100513","['Like: 17 people', 'Care: 14 people', 'Sad: 8 people']",32 comments,5 shares
100512,"I’m someone who really loves children and would like to start a family with children in the future. However, I was diagnosed with a condition and doctors told me that I can never conceive naturally and would need a surrogate to carry my biological child in the future. It really broke my heart when i first received this news, although I’m coping with it better now. I’m worrying a lot about the future that I may never get married due to my infertility. As I want to have children, my partner’s goals would have to align with mine. It’s either we opt for surrogacy or adoption to have children. I prefer having a biological child and would opt for surrogacy (no hate here pls). However, surrogacy costs are really expensive which I can never afford to have. If my future partner wants children and I can’t conceive naturally for him, given the expensive cost of surrogacy or adoption, we may not have children eventually. I’m afraid that I’ll have difficulty finding a partner and face rejection due to my infertility. Any girls out there has fertility issues and faced any rejections before? How do you deal with it? Also, even if my partner accepts me for my infertility, his parents may not. I’m afraid his parents may reject against the marriage or if they allow it, they may treat me badly as a daughter-in-law. Have anyone went through any positive or negative encounters before to share? I’m also worried that I’ll start to grief again if I end up not opting for surrogacy or adoption (they are expensive) and looking at all my friends having children, I’ll want start getting upset about my infertility all over again.

I am a soft-spoken but big guy with a big dog and she is a small but loud lady who screams and exaggerates.

100509,"Interesting to see the gender-polarised comments of #100497. I would like to give a male POV about being accused of sexual harrassment.I was a manager at an MNC then, and the female interviewee had an impressive resume for a fresh grad. She also gave intelligent answers to each of my questions. The only hiccup was that our contractor, hired to conduct background checks on interviewees, flagged that this female had posted a few sexually explicit photos of herself on an app, in addition to numerous comments and posts on social media implying that she was leading an active and casual sex life. I mentioned this, and she replied that her private life was irrelevant and would not detract from her ability to perform at work. I agreed with her, and said: ""My concern is that your promiscuous tendencies would cause you to develop sexual relationships with your male co-workers."" My company was extremely competitive, so I could not afford my men to waste time courting her knowing they are likely to get her in bed, or worse - create internal strife within the all-male team because she was having sex with some but not others. I told her as much, and after a few moments of silence, she said she understood my position and gave a promise to keep her work relationships non-sexual.I took her word for it, and wrote a strongly favourable recommendation to the hiring committee. After a few weeks of no news, I called HR to find out her fate, and was shocked to be told that her application was yanked because she lodged a sexual harrassment complaint against me. The company had independently looked into the matter and (rightly) ruled that I was innocent, so they did not bother informing me about the complaint, but still I felt confused and upset.Why would she give me a verbal assurance to my concern if she felt she was being sexually harrassed? And was I wrong, as a manager, to be thinking in terms of the team?

100508,"Hi all, I need some advice. I've been in a super long term relationship with my current girlfriend. Everything was going fine and it was all lovey-dovey until adulting things happened. Right now, we happen to be at the age where people around us are getting married, BTO-ing etc, and so we also started to talk about finances (which is perfectly normal), but that's also where the problem started. Her expected standards of living are really high (in short, akin to ""taitai"" life). I don't judge that - everyone is entitled to what they want in life. But I'll be honest and admit that it's almost impossible for me to afford that kind of lifestyle for her (at least not in the next few years which she is expecting of me). I believe she herself also started to realise that. It also doesn't help that friends around her are all subscribers to the ""taitai"" lifestyle and they also know my current financial situation. We've sort of talked about it before and I also told her realistically speaking, it's pretty difficult for me to be able to provide her with that lavish lifestyle but I guess we just kinda brushed it aside after awhile and adopted a ""see how"" mindset as we are both quite non-confrontational and don't wanna get into an argument because of thisRecently, I realised that she is starting to go out & meet more people than before, and being on her phone texting more often too - which I have to admit it's making me feel insecure (especially when recently it's just 2 pax restrictions instead of group settings) but I never questioned her about it, because I'm convincing myself to trust her and I really don't want to risk the relationship by questioning her (esp if it was all just paranoia). A part of me is also telling me that I don't have the rights to question her since I'm probably unable to give her the lifestyle that she craves for. As a defence for her, I feel that she is still treating me well.What are my options here? For the first time, I'm really lost.

100505,"Hi, I think I have fallen for this girl in my office. I don't get to interact with her much because she sits far away and she has her own group of colleagues with whom she goes to lunch with. Initially, she joined us but I think she preferred late lunch and somehow all them like late lunch. I have been longer in the company so I am stuck with the older colleagues. It is going to be awkward if I asked to join the junior group, and painfully obvious.Even if we get the chance to talk, it is about work. I get the sense that she is not interested in me because she doesn't laugh at my jokes. There are times when she could immediately approach me for help for her project but instead, she would take her time to ask me for help. There is literally not much chance of me actually even getting to spend time with her.I know this sounds weird but I have never felt so much hurt in my entire life. Once, it even felt like a panic attack. From just a few interactions with her, I know she is an amazing and really good hearted person. Unfortunately, I don't think she thinks much of me. Every time I see her, it hurts me. I prefer not to see her at all because the more I see her, the more hurt I feel. I felt so much hurt when she looked so bored talking to me. I felt completely and utterly hopeless. I felt like a loser. The standard advice I keep getting is to focus on myself. Yeah, I already have hobbies like guitar and gyming. I am happy with my family. I have good friends. My career is decent. I don't know what else to do anymore. I have a girl I like in front of me and how are hobbies or anything else helping me? Sorry, I am just a little frustrated.I don't really know what is the common practice, especially in workplace. I don't even know how to do this. I truly believe my feelings for her are real. I am not getting any chance. I am just suffering within. I plan to walk up to her and confess my feelings to her. If she rejects me, which she probably will, I am ready to quit the job to prevent any awkwardness or discomfort. It is too painful for me to keep my feelings to myself.

100503,"Hi, what is this nonsense??? This is the second time the same exact freaking thing is happening to me. Can someone explain logically to me???? There would be a girl. She would have close friends (both guys and girls) whom she will be hanging out for most of the time. I am not part of their group. Girl approaches me for help. I help the girl, sometimes going out of my way. I fall for the girl and hope she likes me. I would realize she is not interested in me because she does not come on time or would delay meeting me a lot. When we actually meet, she seems bored even though I am cracking jokes (which I do with everyone I meet). She does not even try to include me in her group either.  Once the task is over, she would continue hanging out with her friends. No communication with me whatsoever. Ok, so she does not like me. It is ok, I try to move on. To be honest, it did hurt me quite a lot. I meet her friends accidentally and realize that they were fully capable of helping her. I don't think I am smarter than her friends. In fact, they might be better than me. Why did she approach me instead????The worse part is that after a while, she approaches me AGAIN for help. It is worse because I have tried to forget her so much. And why doesn't she ask her friends for help instead????? All the hurt I felt and finally overcame comes back again and I start to feel the hurt all over AGAIN. She would still be hanging out with her friends, it is not like they are fighting with each other. I try my best to avoid her or help her as quickly as possible to reduce the hurt. Why does she approach me, an outsider? I really cannot wrap my head around this. What is she trying to do here? Is there something going on?My friends are all simple and basically all guys. We roughly know what each other are thinking and life is so so much more easier. I never had to deal with this weird situation until these two exact incidents. One happened in uni and one more is happening now at my new workplace. The girl in my uni got into a relationship with one of the guys in her group later on. And she still came to me AGAIN for help.

100502,"You have never defended me or my emotions. You never tried to explain the cause of my actions to everyone in your life.I never existed in your part of the world.You find being asked genuinely concerning questions a bothersome thing and thus evade and avoid.Which made me suspect that you are hiding somethings now.Trying to understand that you were never comfortable being asked these questions but thinking back, you never cared about answering them at the first place.You never asked me personal or concerning questions and I feel that's unsettling.I find myself always on standby, waiting, making time for you even if you're busy with your own life and career.Only to end up feeling disappointed or worst, burn out by work and no one to express my burn out to.You don't like most of my friends. I don't like yours, too.You try to be the good person but will never want to admit that you're a bad person. And that you make mistakes too. You think of yourself as a perfect person and never trusted how I keep telling you that you are good, you are hardworking but you only care about your own voice.When I revealed my genuine concern about us, you are thankful but you never stopped to consider how much I have endured being unsure of us.You could have had your family and friends teach you all you needed in life but you never lean or counted on any of them. If you did, we wouldn't be in this unsteady relationship.We've been rocky all along. Just blinded by sex.I became your trophy.While I was looking, focusing, doing my best to love you, I couldn't love myself because you were never paying attention to all my efforts trying to understand you.It has been a long and painful relationship for me. I just want out. Work is tough. But our relationship made it tougher for me to live.I never want this. I want a loving person who goes out of their way to understand my heart.

100497,"Had a good laugh over fake story #100479 but it did bring to mind an incident that happened to me a few years ago, which till today I am not sure if it was sexual harrassment. It was an interview for an entry-level position, and I was dressed in a very common style: white buttoned shirt and black pencil skirt. So I was quite shocked when his first question to me was, ""Do you know your bra is clearly visible through your shirt? It is very distracting."" I looked down and thought he was being rather harsh. Sure, I was wearing a coloured bra, but it was light pink and it certainly wasn't ""clearly visible"". I didn't want to rebut him and screw the interview, so I just apologised and offered to wear a jacket. To which he said, ""Never mind, I don't have much time, let's just get on with the interview.""I guess my uncertainty over whether I was sexually harrassed stems from the fact that I am not sure what his ""very distracting"" refers to. Was it distracting because it was unsightly? Or did he mean that the sight of my bra was sexually provocative to him? I am inclined towards the latter, because if it was unsightly to him then why would he dismiss my offer to wear a jacket? But that might be making an unfair assumption - maybe my wardrobe malfunction triggered his bad mood as he thought he was wasting time with an unprofessional candidate.Of course it doesn't matter now; in the end I did get the job but turned it down because I received a better offer elsewhere. But I just thought I would share my story and hear what you guys think.-#100497: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100497","['Like: 34 people', 'Haha: 16 people']",70 comments,3 shares

100488,"Seeking Prof Ben and everyone else's kind opinions please. I don't know if this counts as quarter/mid-life crisis or is it just me overthinking about life? Am unsure if it is the covid pandemic that's making me question everything, or if there's really some sort of misalignment in my life that I should address. Sorry if it's a boring topic as I don't really have anyone else to approach.I'm in my mid 20s and graduated from uni few years back, but my current (first) job is not entirely aligned to what I've learnt in school. Now that I think about it, my current job seems to only give me broad-based skills but not in-depth industry-specific skills that can help me stand out from others. At the same time, it seems like most people my age are already experts in certain industries and are likely to continue with it, whereas I'm just kind of like a sampan in the sea, unsure which job/industry I should float to next. It could partly be because my broad-based skills doesn't entirely bound me to a particular industry, but because they are too broad, I'm worried that I could be easily replaceable or unable to stand out due to lack of knowledge in certain industries that I wish to pursue next time. Beyond work, I feel that I lack some consistency as well. It seems that most people are good at a few areas (e.g. music / sports / knowledgeable about certain things etc). But for me, I'm just all over the place and not really an expert in any areas, akin to Jack of all trades but master of none. As a result, I sometimes feel lost as to which are the things I ought to be better at or work towards to even though they are just leisure activities.

100486,"I'm thinking that I should break up with my boyfriend. He used to be open-minded and understanding. He never judged people for their background or struggles, and was a good listener who was always really encouraging.He's not that way anymore. Nowadays all he does is judge me for making ""stupid decisions"" by staying in a certain mathematically-intense STEM major which I'm struggling with academically. At the same time, when I decided to pick up a second major in another area which I can score in, he mocks me for choosing that area because it's not financially lucrative or ""intellectually challenging"". He even mocks me for not being able to get internships despite sending in dozens of applications, whereas he gets the first internship he applies for at a prestigious MNC.He doesn't even listen to me anymore. He can be discussing something in the news related to technology for example, and when I try to give my input, he just dismisses me with a ""yeah yeah"" or ""I'm sure I'll learn that eventually anyway"". He complains about how everything in university is too easy (he's a finance major), and that he's surrounded by stupid people. He also told me not to mention anything irrelevant to finance to him because I'd be wasting his time. He also enjoys mocking me for finding the math in my major hard, and pointed out that he never struggled with the math in FIN2704 or the DAO level 1000s (note: he hasn't done anything above level 2000s yet).This feels like a full 180 from his original personality. And this new personality of his is horrifying, egotistical and disgusting. I realize that I've been clinging onto the ideal of him for too long, because the past version of him that I fell for is no longer the person that is present today. He has no respect for me, my major, any major not related to his major, or even anyone from his major. I even suspect he's overestimating his own competencies when it comes to finance itself, because from what I hear, finance gets extremely elaborate the higher up you go (but I need someone to verify this). Just scoring an A for FIN2704 does not automatically make one a Wolf of wall street.-#100486: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100486","['Like: 36 people', 'Haha: 15 people', 'Care: 13 people']",41 comments,4 shares

100484,"In my final year of uni and am seriously stressed out over internships/job opportunities. My close friend circle have managed to snag confirmed job opportunities with large and prestigious firms with promised starting pays of around $5-7k/mth, whereas I've been continually rejected by almost every place I've applied to. Getting really demoralized, and on top of that it's exam season and I've always struggled really hard with academics. I feel like I'm dying throughout every module whereas my friends just keep complaining about how uni is not challenging enough for them and wishing the syllabus could be harder. Yet, when I ask them for help, they get defensive and claim they do not know how to explain something ""commonsense"" to someone like me. I'm starting to lose hope because I don't think I'm cut out for it. Life after uni I mean. I'm already pretty sure I'm not cut out for uni so I'm just gritting my teeth and forcing myself through it since I'm almost nearing the finish line anyway. It just kinda sucks because I feel like I've taken this opportunity of privilege and wasted it by not doing well in it, even though I tried my hardest. It also sucks because my friends are starting to condescend to me for struggling with things that are so easy for them. They told me I should ""go for the lowest bar"" and go into ""manual labour"" or become a ""tai tai"" or a ""prostitute"", because those things ""don't require intellectual ability"" because I'm slow on the uptake.  I think it's really elitist. They weren't like this originally, but after getting these confirmed job opportunities, they've become really arrogant and condescending. They're also making fun of me for not having the right family background. Like: ""wah you dont even have family to help you ah? your family must really be as stupid as you are"". My parents were secondary school and JC washouts and have social adjustment issues, so they can't really help me because they're still struggling with their jobs and life every day. They've been having daily breakdowns for as long as I can remember because life is too stressful.  Normally, I'm able to shrug all this off. But the thing is: I'm nearing the end, and I don't really see any progress from my first year of uni to my last, so the self-doubt and inferiority is starting to eat at me. I'm worried I'll end up as stressed out and miserable as my parents, despite going to uni. I feel bad for wasting all that money because in the end, I didn't really amount to much. I feel guilty because it seems like I gave my family false hope. My CAP isn't all great; my portfolio isn't all that great either though I'm pushing myself above and beyond my limits every day.  I'm starting to break because I realize I don't really have anyone who can relate to what I'm going through. My friends are living the high life. My parents are struggling so hard that they don't have time and energy to listen. The school counsellor doesn't really get it, and keeps telling me to ""communicate"". But it's difficult to communicate to people who just won't get it.-#100484: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100484","['Care: 76 people', 'Like: 46 people', 'Sad: 17 people']",52 comments,10 shares

100479,"Disclaimer: This is a rant (and advice, sort of).      Hi everyone, I am a graduate from the covid batch, working for more than a year now at a research company. This week, I had to give my half-yearly presentation on my research results to the senior management, and it turned into a debacle.      Firstly, right before I entered the boardroom, I was told by a fellow female staff that I had a ""very bad case of VPL"" (for those unfamiliar, it stands for visible panty line). I was obviously mortified to have that pointed out to me and, against my better judgment, rushed back to my cubicle and took off my underwear while cursing my decision to wear a figure-hugging dress.      Thinking I had the problem solved, I happily began my presentation and thought I did a rather good job when I kept seeing heads nodding. Then when the Q&A started, there were a few moments of silence and some mysterious eye-widening and exchange of looks, and I was like, ""Oh shit, I messed it up."" But no, I was praised for my results and there were just a few questions which I thought I handled quite well. So when I left the room I was pretty much on cloud nine, until a few moments later when the secretary/minutes-taker rushed up to me and said ""You need to come back."" She looked like her dog just passed away and I panicked, asking why. Then I was mortified for a second time that morning when she explained that when the lights came on during the Q&A, apparently the lights were so bright that my white dress became slightly see-through and my pubic hair was visible. I remember literally stopping in my tracks and looking at her with horror, and she kindly said, ""Don't worry, you won't be fired, you just need to apologise for your indecent outfit."" I looked at the nearest window and contemplated jumping out of it.     Resolutely covering my crotch with my hands as I re-entered the room, the next 15 minutes of my life could only be described as surreal.     Old Man 1: Do you know why you have been called back?     Me: Uh, yes sir...     Old Man 1: Do you wish to say anything?     Me: (takes a deep breath) I wish to apologise for my, uh, outfit today. I was told by a colleague that I had a case of visible panty lines only minutes before the meeting, and as I thought that would be unsightly to the audience I stupidly tried to fix that problem by removing my panties. I did not realise that my, uh, pubic hair would become visible. I sincerely apologise to everyone who was offended by the obscene sight. It was unintentional.     Old Man 2: Well, I wouldn't go so far to call it obscene, but it certainly was unkempt. (everyone laughs)     Me: (laughs awkwardly)     Old Man 3: Just remember to shave next time, young lady. (everyone laughs again)     Me: (laughs awkwardly again) Uh, yes sir, I will remember to shave.     Old Man 1: Well, let's not have her lack of personal grooming detract from her brilliant results. (laughter) Don't worry about this, [my name]. Just be more careful next time. And good job. You may leave. (claps)     The room claps for me, and I nervously bowed 3 times before rushing out and transforming into Usain Bolt as I sprinted back to my cubicle and reunited with my underwear.     Epilogue: I spent half my lunch hour going to the nearest mall and finding a shaver, and the other half using it.

Day in day out its the same thing. I'm not saying that's terrible, I know a lot of people are struggling to find work and all, but I'm not sure if I want to be doing the same thing every week for the rest of my life.It's not just work though, my boyfriend H is also working, secured a job before he grad (same batch) and is making a bit more than me. But it's like we've gotten nowhere in the relationship, he's not trying anymore and we rarely even meet at all nowadays. He's always too tired and I'm unfortunately always flooded with work during lunch hours so we can't meet for lunch or after work. We meet up on Saturday but it's really nothing much, sit around and talk for an hour then he has to go home and catch up on sleep.I saw my ex A's insta story shared by one of my friends n it seems like he's having it much better than me so idk I really think it's just me. He's representing nus in some competition even after graduation and it seems like he's doing really well for himself? He's got friends and somehow his clique is still together after graduation while I can't even get my group chat to reply me at all.The lack of contact with my bf is also driving me to think about happier times with my ex again because he was really much more spontaneous and more fun to be with and all around better... I just didn't see myself with him long term like A is fun and exciting but he's just not marriage material while H is kind of pretty good husband material at least before he became so detached now... And to avoid thinking like this I dive more into work and it all just repeats.

It’s not just I have  “no empathy” for “other people”. Even if the same thing happens to me, if my own mum dies, I also won’t cry. I imagined that happening and I tried to feel sad but I can’t?5. My second boyfriend who had sex with several ex girlfriends before he met me cried when he got letters during national service. 7. My Uni room mate who had a long history of one night stands since 18, who had a drawer of sex toys, is often seen weeping in front of the laptop with mountains of tissues beside her when any touching video/wedding speech is on. 8. My cousin (different parents, surely not so strict) who had sex with her boyfriend in a serious relationship naturally feels emotions, and cried at many movies. 10. My “not close friend but still good friend” who has 5 fwb and 3 long term boyfriends always cries at sappy songs and movies. Yes and she cried for months after her dog died, unlike people from strict families. 11. The 2 girls in our clique who are open about their masturbating habits ,who always have casual sex, are the EXACT TWO who have tear stained faces after every touching movie we watch on Netflix parties over zoom. It’s not confirmation bias, there are indeed 2 empathetic and emotional friends who never had sex . But how significant are 2 exceptions??? I listed 11 examples but I observed 50?It’s not a 0 or 1 thing. I didn’t say sexual intimacy makes you emotional, I’m saying it makes you MORE emotional. what I’m saying is it ENHANCES, not CAUSES, EQ. If someone’s empathy quotient is naturally 50, good for her, and it can go up to 80. If you’re naturally born with empathy quotient 20, it probably raises to 50? Personality is influenced not just by genetics but also environment. You can have tall and skinny genes but diet plays a part also. I’m not expecting to get a vibrator on Monday and suddenly tear up at sad scenes by Tuesday, but what’s the “long term” effects of sex hormones on EQ? It’s like LONG TERM exposure to carcinogenic substances kill you, not one sniff. Drinking milk REGULARLY helps you grow tall, not one glass of milk helps you grow 5 cm in one day. Love is the cause of grief. So the absence of grief is the absence of love. To memorise what “arousal” and “orgasm” mean is IQ, but to feel them from the bottom of the heart, is EQ. It’s not mechanical. Can you still get aroused and orgasm if your EQ is Low? Look, I’m not trying to be a better person just to “fit in”. I am genuinely trying to stop being such a cold psychopath from the inside. I am not trying to get advice to “act” like I have feelings, but rather to genuinely feel emotions. Please tell me how to be a better person. I really want to change.-#100469: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100469","['Like: 25 people', 'Haha: 20 people', 'Care: 6 people']",52 comments,12 shares
100466,"Im just sad and alone.I could never talk to my parents. My dad whom i tried countlessly to fix my relationship with, doesnt listen to me nor even want to have a proper conversation with me. Everytime he starts the conversation, i tried to give my input, he was always telling me that im wrong or scolding me to the extent that rather than talking back i just kept quiet or just say he is right eventhough he isnt. My mum demanded me for money everytime and only talks about my money. She wants to boast me to her friends when i told her not to cause i felt really pressured if i didnt met it or even get what she wants. She doesnt listen to anything i say cause her friends is always telling her things which affects her thinking.I definitely love my job but the politics, favoritism and toxicity right here was keeping me demotivated. My two managers was throwing lots of things to me without any guidance and kept promising my promotion which has been a year. And they lead this toxic culture where they only pick who they wanted and kept secrets eventhough my colleagues and I are the same position, i kept doing more so they would recognize my efforts, in the end nothing matters, just cause im young and capable to others doesnt mean they can keep blaming me when something goes wrong that my other colleague initiated. I decided i should just gave my resignation letter and find another company that values my skills and capability.My boyfriend is younger than me, we live in different countries. He only cares when he is able to play games, watch movies or literally does his things when he is with me. He does call me everyday which i truly appreciate despite the distance, but he doesnt bother to ask me how is my day or when we argued, he would always talk back and wants to win the fight. Not to mention, when we play games, he would always blame and scold me when he dies or when someone isnt covering him. He did cheat on me once and i caught him but he didnt felt guilty or any signs of regret. I still forgive him eventhough he cheated. He would always find her to play games when im not around or even saying things like 'my girlfriend isnt around, lets go play' , 'my girlfriend isnt here today' , flirting with her saying things like 'its okay if you noob, we noob together' but with me 'u fking noob, better quit'. When i take initiative to tell me my day, he would brush it off with i dont understand what you're saying or try to divert the attention to something else. I felt alone with no one to talk to or lean on as he asked me to cut off my friendships. When he hurt me and i cried, he didnt care, he just wanted to win the argument and left me all alone, crying to myself. He rather sides all the people he just met than his own girlfriend to avoid conflict. What should i do? Im just on the verge to giving up on life. I know it was my choice but i still do hope there is people with good heart who wants to make the world into a better place.-#100466: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100466","['Care: 16 people', 'Like: 12 people', 'Sad: 11 people']",36 comments,5 shares

100462,"When I was having lunch at the Engin canteen the other day, I couldn't help but notice how most of our younger generation nowadays fail to observe basic personal cleanliness and hygiene. Allow me to elaborate.Everyone had his/her mask on when they were not eating/drinking. Yes, that's fine and commendable even, but the way people handled their mask was what made me sick! We should always remove our mask by holding on to the ear loops and avoid touching the outer surface of the mask where all the germs, bacteria and viruses are. We should then either place our mask with the exposed surface facing out on a clean table or hang it on our arms above the elbow, also with the exposed surface facing out. I would prefer the latter, as I wouldn't know if the table is clean.I always thought the above is basic knowledge on handling of masks. But NO! What I saw was people removing their mask with both hands touching the fabric. Inside, outside no difference. Imagine the amount of germs transferred from the outer layer of the mask to the wearer's hands, and to the inner surface of the mask in contact with the wearer's face. Guess what, that's just before these people have their meal. They would then go on to grab their utensils, touch their face, touch their hair, touch other people... Just typing out the above makes me sick!Not only that, some smarter ones even shoved their mask INSIDE THEIR POCKET OR HANDBAG. Oh my sweet Lord Jesus!!! Don't you know your mask is full of COVID and you have just contaminated your pocket and handbag with COVID virus??? Let me ask a question to those who are guilty of the above: DO YOU ALSO STUFF YOUR SOILED UNDERPANTS INSIDE YOUR POCKET OR HANDBAG?There were also some geniuses who thought there were Supermen and Superwomen by pulling down their mask and proceeding with eating and drinking straight away. Come on, man!!! You all are NUS students, you all are supposed to be smart! Don't tell me basic common sense also you guys don't have ah??? When you pull down your mask and let it hang below your chin, you are going to DIRECTLY BREATHE IN THE GODDAMN VIRUS!!! If you are lucky enough, the damn virus will get into your food and you are going to consume the virus straight into your system.Yet people are wondering why our daily cases are going up by the thousands and deaths due to COVID-19 are consistently up there.

My in laws are very traditional and demanding people so it's pretty much impossible for me to get close to them.

On instances when you are busy with work and other commitments, is it appropriate to get your husband to visit by himself?

As a height inadequate guy in 2021 (1.71m), I feel that nature has been pretty unfiar to me when all my peers are at least 1.8m or even 1.9m yet I am stuck in a kid's body. Media is portraying tall guys and gals, leaving no room for people our height.Even ladies near my age or younger than me are already atleast my height, which worsens this feeling. When Mankind is stuck with Covid19, part of me sympathize with the world, yet part of me feel that we all deserve this for much inequality. Also, I have not been vaccinated because nature has already screwed me by making me largely different from many people. So why should I join the majority and poke the needle in my body?

I have a collection of figurines and it has becomes a hobby for me. However, I definitely know I am doing it sensibly. I have a stable job, which i have been working for the company for close to 5 years. I don't spend all my incomes on anime collection or stuff. I always will put in effort to save a sum monthly and even give my parents some allowances every month. So, soon I decide to try to go into a relationship and try dating several girls. But most often, they sort of reluctant to support my hobbies, some even feel disgusted about it. They feel I may care for my ""anime girls"" more than them. But I always make it a point that I am not the type of guy that doesn't differentiate and basically anime is just my hobbies which I hope my partner will be supportive of.

As much as I understand the generational differences, I can't help but think that they don't care about my happiness. They see my stress, and they see me working till 12am on some days, but yet they can still say that this is a good job and I shouldn't leave.

My mom is constantly threatening to divorce my dad and ""get half, along with the house"". When I was younger, she said this on and off to get her way, though sometimes I think it was a joke. But this got serious when my dad decided to retire early, as my mom got really mad and threatened divorce to demand him to get a job again. It terrified my dad and he went back to his company and they agreed to let him do part-time admin. We're actually doing ok financially, I earn a decent salary and can support them, and my dad was doing quite well as a day trader and was trying out ecommerce. My mom now pulls out this divorce ""leverage"" for almost anything else now to force my dad to agree.Is this what we're signing up for? I mean, we buy an incredibly expensive ring and spend tens of thousands on a wedding, and are expected to get down on our knees to ask for...what, exactly?I know a lot of comments will be about commitment and companionship and all that fluff. But you can have companionship without marriage. You can even have children without marriage. You can have love and commitment without marriage, in fact that should come before marriage, as marriage itself doesn't grant you those things. All it does is force you to stay together whether you're really happy or not in the future, or one party (largely) pays the price.

I'm just letting off steam by writing & hence its gonna take a while at my pace cos writing allows me to relive those precious memories I have. These memories are all that I have left and reliving seemed to allow me to escape the existential meaninglessness of life for that moment no matter how brief it seemed. If you find the article long, would suggest you skip.  Part I: https://NUSWhispers.com/tag/100401Part II: https://www.NUSWhispers.com/tag/100416)Her 1st message really meant A LOT to  me. How much would you ask? Well, I have made & lost millions before but the sheer euphoria I felt when I saw her message pop into my window in that dark night simply dwarfed seeing those zeros in your bank account when you liquidate your positions.  I know it might sound trivial or out of touch but that was really the sheer intense feeling of completeness I felt. Ever since that day, we started messaging each other almost sporadically and then it started to increase in frequency because I guess she started feeling home sick. Despite her husband's frantic schedule, she would take these amazing trips with him to all those different beautiful places in Europe. I would often sigh while looking at her newsfeed wishing it was me with my arms around her waist, looking at the auburn coniferous leaves falling onto her hair or snuggling with her in a giant blanket with heavy snow outside. Once, she complained to me she was craving for Nasi Lemak but she wasn't able to get fresh Pandan leaves to make it from scratch. So I literally ordered online a mini greenhouse complemented with Pandan fresh shoots to grow which I then sent to her house. Seeing how happy she was when the first pandan plants started growing tall really really made my day. I wanted to escalate our conversation to a full phone call but even with the Greenhouse after a full year, I couldn't guide our conversation to a voice call. Life also got in the way for me as I would have to re-arrange my schedule just to be able to be awake during the hours that she was in. It was like having a long distance relationship without being into one and I would find myself staring obsessively at my FB messenger just waiting for that green bubble icon over her profile to appear. This was until one day I found out her favorite author was Ernest Hemmingway who happened to be mine as well. We started exchanging our favorite parts of his books like The old man & the sea as well as For whom the bell tolls as well as exchanging our favorite quotes of his. We had talked about how broken our lives were and she sent me this particular quote before she turned in for the night:""We are broken. That's how the light gets in.""Ernest Hemmingway. I remembered summoning all my affection for her and the words came to me in a torrentous flurry. I replied her with a short verse:""We are all one step from the precipice of ruin Corrupted by Fallen angels mired deep in Sin.Hearts & souls to be shattered  from within Cos when we are broken. That's how the light gets in.""The next day, she called me up on FB on how she loved my verse and I spent a full delightful hour just talking to her & listening to her sweet sweet voice. I guess there is just something about the richness of voice that just makes texting so one dimensional. Her voice was so gentle and laced with sweetness but still with this fiery zest & wonderment for life.Talking to her was the highlight of my day. No matter how hard it was, when I unloaded my problems on her, talking to her was like a soothing balm. I really felt I could be just myself when we talked, that I could be me. I felt I could conquer the world if she tells me to. I was able to know so much more about her and our calls got more and more frequent over time, usually when her husband was at the university and she was at home alone. We would also watch movies online together. Throughout our conversations, it took me a herculean effort to keep it chaste as I was worried she might get the wrong idea. This went on for a full 3 months until she told me she was approached by a  headhunter in Singapore for a position in a Korean cosmetics firm which she had applied for previously. The headhunter didn't realize she was in Europe at the time but I persuaded her to interview anyway as she and her husband were scheduled to be home in SG in 8mths. I guess I would skip this part as its not that interesting; but what I did was find a way to ""convince"" the head at the Korean firm to pick her and she came back to Singapore a full 6 months before her husband was able to finish his post doc. You have no idea how crazy happy I was helping her book the flight home.I will continue what happen later.(To be continued…)-#100444: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100444","['Like: 36 people', 'Love: 3 people']",20 comments,9 shares

100440,"Hey Prof and world, recently I met a girl that I am really interested in. She is a scholar that came here from her country in pursuit of higher education. In these covid times, I don't really have the opportunity to interact with her as I only have one mod with her. Nonetheless, in the little time that I spent with her in class, I feel that we have much in common and would like to know her better.   But, she doesn't really use the social media communication platform that most uni students use, so it is a great hurdle to get to her. Because of this, I don't know exactly how she feels about me and how I should even engage her to know her more. Sometimes, I really feel that I might be infringing on her privacy by pming her because I think she doesn't know that I am into her. Time is running out with the exams approaching and ending in a few weeks time. After this semester, we are probably not gonna meet anymore... Should I just ask her out after the exams? Will it be too sudden? Honestly, in this day and age, because of the advent of technology, everyone is either termed a creep or a pursuer of love when it comes to romance.

100438,"just to share some household story. we've been married for almost 15 years, with 3 kids, and my wife's parents stay with us. I earn a decent pay although so extravagant. we have been living comfortably with simple lifestyle. Everything looks good till recently. My wife met 2 lady friends of hers, one is a 55 year old virgin, another is a divorcee. These 2 are like always in her life recently, she will like whatever they like, she will be sad when anyone of them tell her sad stories of theirs, and of course their hatred story to men. One of them start to keep talkin about how free is her single life can go travelling soon after vtl opens, buys 50k designer bags, buy 5k ticket concerts, etc... Then my life starts to become upside down, when i firmly reject her request for a 40k bag and going overseaz a.s.a.p, as need to save for kid, education, and for rainy days, and she has dozens of new and decent bags at home anyway..not to mention that is 25% of my total saving.  After that, everyday she will make scenes with everyone in the house, when u do A, she told u why never think to do B, which is better(according to her). Next time u do B, she will say why not A or C, why so stupid cannot think, etc.  Well, i dont care so much about all these verbal abuses myself, i am mature enough to not be distracted, but i am quite worried about how all this affects the kids and oldies at home, they always get baited into the argument with her, and everyone will end up screaming here and there. I start to think about saving my kids by live a separate life from her. Well, the morale of the story is please people, if u urself have a bad life like those 2 friends, be careful when share stories, some of your friends are not mentally strong enough or may be affected by your mood. If u really need help, go seek professional helps, dont get into a chance of ruining other people's happy life by sharing ur bad stories. If u have too much money to spend, no need to keep boasting what u buy to others that are not so fortunate, while i honour the right of speech, u just dont know the butterfly effect of your storiez...-#100438: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100438","['Like: 96 people', 'Haha: 23 people', 'Care: 15 people']",50 comments,26 shares

100431,"My gf and I have been together for nearly 3 years now. We met in an orientation camp during our first year and I am 3 years older than her. She is from Malaysia and does not have much friends here so she spend most of the time hanging out with me. She isn’t exactly the “goddess” kind of girl. She is the girl-next-door type that you will easily fall in love with. Good-natured, cheerful and sweet. She smiles a lot. She is tall for a girl, at 174cm (I am only 178cm) and very slim. She is tan as she likes to swim. She wear her hair in a simple bob at chin length (till recently), which she trim once it touches her shoulder. She told me she keep the same hairstyle since primary school. She dress simple, T-shirts and shorts most of the time, or T-shirt and Jeans if attending class. She doesn’t put on makeup. I like her a lot because she is very understanding and doesn’t have high expectation (of me). Unlike my exs, she does not expects nice and expensive gift from me.  Sometimes she cook and pack lunch for me. She really cook well. She never complaint that I play computer game a lot, and she sit quietly at the side when I was having a game of basketball with my friend. She doesn’t go clubbing but she never complain a single time when I went clubbing with my buddy without her. She never flare up and never a harsh word to me. She don’t expect me to do anything for her and will even volunteer to help me run my errand. At the start of this year, she start visiting me at home during weekends, and she will stay for dinner. My mother likes her because she is very polite, help in the house chores and she help makes dinner whenever she was here. Then one time, it getting quite late and my mother ask her to stay for the night. From then on, she stay over every weekend. We start to have sex. Surprisingly she is very active, unlike the demure self in the day. I can’t help but notice how skinny she is, and wish that she can put on a little more weight. So every weekend, we live just like any young couple, study, watch Netflix, going to buy groceries, meals, sex etc nothing special. But I felt blissful.  Then something changed a month ago. She always followed me to the malay barbershop downstairs, and wait for me to get my haircut. But this time, she wants to cut her hair too, I was surprise and told her I can bring her to a nice salon. She said its ok as it here cheaper here, and moreover she want a shorter cut which normal salon don’t do good. So I watched helplessly as the barber cut a good 10cm of her hair to a boyish cut that revealed her ears. If it was cut in a salon, it will pass off as a pixie cut, maybe more feminine. I don’t like it and told her to grow her hair long. She just smile. My family members are surprised by her haircut too. But my mother was all praise at how sweet she look even with such short hair. I can’t believe my mother actually encourage her. Anyway, after this incident, I become conscious of how Tomboy she look and dress. I get annoyed when my female friend teased that she looked great and will fall in love with her. So the last straw. Last week I went for my monthly haircut, she said she wanted a trim as well. I told her No as she supposed to grow her hair long. She said just a trim as the hair at the ear is sticking out and keep persuading me. Finally I agreed. So after my haircut, she sat down on the same chair. She converse with the Encik in malay for quite a while and the cape was put on. To my horror, the barber start to use a clipper and dig deep onto her nape and high onto the back of her head. I exclaimed that it shouldn’t be this short. My gf however assured the barber it’s ok and urge him to continue. I get really angry with each pass of the clipper. The final cut is a neat man haircut with closely clipper side and back. The top is no more than 5cm and well combed. My gf can easily pass off as an army regular anytime. I was so angry I cursed at her. I keep silence the world day without speaking to her. At night, seeing that I am still angry, she offer to have sex with me. While we are at it, I can’t help but keep seeing the closely clipper part of her head. It feels weird on my hand and I lost interest. I feel like I am having sex with a man. It’s been a week since I avoid her. I know its only hair and it will grow, I should not be petty as a man. Moreover she is such a wonderful girl. But she lost all her attraction to me and I can’t kick away the feeling that I am dating a man. I know I am the jerk to be thinking this way. I am blessed with such a wonderful girl as my gf, but at times I really wished that she is more curvy and well-endowed; and doll up a little.-#100431: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100431","['Haha: 156 people', 'Like: 92 people']",186 comments,105 shares

100436,"Hi internet, just want to ask for some opinions. I (F) have a guy best friend who I hang out with almost daily. We go out on weekends, study together although we're from different courses, eat lunch/dinner/supper together almost every day when I'm out without fail. Contrary to popular belief (from literally everyone we come across), I am not his girlfriend and he is already attached to someone (1.5 years from the same school) he knew shorter than knowing me (2.5 years of friendship, with some history xd). Recently, there are also instances where we made out and hung out very intimately, hugging and all. He and his girlfriend only meet every few weeks or less, they almost seem like an internet couple because they are not intimate i.e. don't have sex with one another. Am I a homewrecker? Is he emotionally/physically cheating on his girlfriend?-#100436: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100436","['Haha: 43 people', 'Like: 25 people', 'Angry: 11 people']",75 comments,23 shares
100435,"Hi Readers, I am trying to get new perspectives about relationship matters. If there is a third party in a RS, would the girl/guy forgive and move on?  I know majority of the people will say move on and next one will be better. If he cheat once, he will cheat again, leopard doesn’t change its spot. Once trust is broken, is hard to trust again and it will not be the same. Most people will rather end the relationship and find a new partner. But does that solve the underlying problem? If one will cheat does that mean that even change partner will also cheat? On the other hand, the innocent party decided to move on and find a new parter that also doesn’t guarantee he/she won’t cheat. People will change, it is always nice in the beginning but as time passes love will fade. Nobody know what will happen in future. What I am thinking is that why couple don’t try to look at the underlying problem and try to salvage the relationship by resolving differences and conflicts? For example the girl is still willing to trust the guy again and the guy is really ashamed of his two timing action and reflected on his mistake?Can the two of them fall in love with each other again after the betrayal? I believe there are many factors to consider such as to what extent the cheating goes. The character of the person who cheat and if he really knows his mistake. The intimate relationship in first place if is toxic or is plainly a silly mistake. Single or married and kids consideration. It will be endless scenarios if want to name it. The scenario I am suggesting here is the couple is in 6 years relationship and preparing to get married soon and BTO is ready next year. Proposal supposed to happen soon and the guy already bought engagement ring. But the girl found out that he is texting and going out with another girl recently. He claims is emotional cheating and no physical cheating involved. The guy realized his mistake and could not face the girl after what he did. But both of them really love each other and really thought they will get married and have a happy family. There should be a cause and cheating is an effect right. Any success stories of couple getting back together and be really in love again after cheating? Would love to hear these kind of acnedotes in real life.-#100435: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100435","['Like: 13 people', 'Haha: 5 people']",24 comments,5 shares
100434,"To #100426I have been in the exact same position. My parents called the police and said that i was attempting suicide and i was imprisoned for 24 hrs. Prior to that, they pointed and chased aft me with a knife. It takes courage for your friend to make any sort of move. Trust me because i never dared to do anything concrete until i turned 26. It is a constant conundrum in his/her mind that they will be unfilial and yet they know its not right and they are stuck. The first thing you should do, is to show concern and care quietly, being there for him/her. It helped me alot when people cared about me because it made me feel like i do matter and i shld take my life into control. The next step is to try and help your friend to gather the courage to move to a safe space. This is very very hard. Its strange to random strangers, but even when i was heavily abused until i had dislocations and injuries on a regular basis, i still didn't want to leave. I was afraid that if i leave, i would have no family and be all alone. And even till date, this feelings are there. So please be understanding if your friend refuses, it takes courage. Your friend has to want it on his/her own and be aware that it is a long journey. It has to start with emotional detachment (aka indifference- not hate etc), then once that is done, actual physical steps to move out will be alot easier to push him/her towards that. Alternatively, open up a safe place for him/her toi hang out alone etc. Reports in sgp are pretty much useless. I was advised to file a PPO but that does not stop immediate danger etc. And it is emotionally difficult, you need to be a solid pillar to your friend. I feel that fighting it legally or by laws are too long drawn out personally and it does not help one's mental health in the short term. What i did was that i realised that these experiences are hurting me in ways i never thought and as diagnosed by a psychiatrist, i have grown immune to fear of violence as well as the inability to get out of the fight or flight mode. So that affects my decisions in life and also causes me to be consistently on alert. Once i realised that, i worked with the therapist to make boundaries for myself - emotional and physical. And i started preparing finances and all. And with that, the fear of being all alone was mitigated. I still stay with my parents because they have grown too old. Resentment and hatred is definitely still there, but i have made peace with myself on my life and i know that if i need to leave, i will, with no regrets. Your friend needs time to do this. But it takes time, and even when he/she does all of those, it will still haunt him/her. This isn't a months long journey, it will be for years. I hope this helps.-#100434: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100434","['Like: 23 people', 'Care: 10 people']",0 Comments,1 comment
100059,"Hi NUSWhispers, I have a real career dilemma and I really need some advice. Context: I've been offered a regional sales/business development role in Company B but I really like where I'm at with Company A (distributor company). Furthermore, I've been moving from job to job (switching every 1.5-2 years due to various factors mainly due to lack of growth and challenges in my job). I'm only in my current role for about 6 months and I'm tasked with some major projects which are super exciting as well but will take about 1-2 years to see fruition. Should I switch and go regional or stay and do the job I like with relatively supportive peers?Here are more details about the situation:- Boss is super supportive. Gave me a pay raise upon confirmation (Current pay is about SGD5.6k before comms). However, Boss also practices favoritism (but he doesn't know that he's doing this). Boss is also quite micromanage-y and wanting to be involved with certain large deals and discussions, which means that he also doesn't really trust me.- I brought in various regional opportunities to the team and was promised that I would be handling these opportunities. After a company-wide meeting today, it is clear that opportunity is now being given to the 'favourite' to see it through. Boss told me that if I do regional work, I will need to do it for $0 pay increment as he needs about 1 year to justify for the promotion and increment. So he feels like he doesn't want to shortchange me. - Opportunity given by Company B is a tough role but it's also very exciting - e.g. needing to travel to various places to do some BD work/other high level directive collaboration (think involving big govts etc.) which my current company will not be able to provide for me. Company B is also one of the top few brands in the market.- Target of Company A is challenging but manageable. Company B is about 4-5X the target and I will confirm plus chop work like a dog. Company A has quite good work life balance, OT as and when you like.- Company A is an SME with good-ish manager, good-ish peers, supportive C-level executives. I will definitely be well taken care of in the company. Company B is a Chinese MNC backed by a non-profit research group which publishes multiple papers with high impact score. They are expanding so rapidly and have no chance to hire fast enough. Because of the research backing, everyone wants to collaborate with this company. But culture-wise, management-wise etc, it's a total black hole. I've spoken to the hiring manager about 2-3 times about the role and have also had the chance to work with her on other projects previously. Work-wise, we seem to be able to get along fine. - Hiring manager in Company B is my age, 27 years old and new to managing people. I'm scared that she will not know how to go about managing people.Overall I feel like whether I stay or go, both are very good choices. But the hiring manager has also said that these opportunities are honestly far and few between and taking the job will change the total trajectory of the course of my career. Taken in totality, what factors should I consider before making a jump? Since I was headhunted, I was thinking about asking for a 30-40% pay raise also - is this too high lolLooking forward to hearing some good suggestions and thoughts! Appreciate it!

100432,"I have just noticed something really weird about my grandma. Is it normal for her temper to get worse as she ages? It isnt like that towards me or my brother, but to the house helper. In the past, she is really nice to them. Brother and I only had 2 since we were born for which they stayed until we got into secondary school and then they decided to leave (at separate times) to start their families. And since then, we have gotten a new one every year because my grandma isnt happy with them. She complains about how they cant do things right and when she tells them off, they look at her angrily. She tells me ""they will murder me in my sleep"" so she locks her bedroom doors. But despite her ""fear"", she still scolds them and make them cry. They never stay for long and I overheard my mother informing my grandma that another switch will incur penalties such as the employer going for special courses. The worst part of it all is that the employer is listed as my mother, who treats them really well. So if another switch happens, my mother will be the one forced onto these special classes, not my grandma. I wanted to try amd mediate so I sat down to discuss things. My grandma seems to hate this one fact the most about the current helper: she requests 3 days off per month. I find that very reasonable but my grandma says ""last time the maid will never dare ask for this because they want to save more money. Now the maid not as good."" She also says that the helper must never eat at the same table as us. Whenever I buy snavks for everyone, even including one for the helper, my grandma will refuse to give her one, and rather eat half of hers and give the helper the leftovers. She does the same for the portion I buy for the helper, so the she always eats leftovers. Another instance is when I go out for coffee and asked my grandma beforehand if she wanted coffee too. She said no and when I asked the helper of she wanted one, she smiled sweetly and asked for a small cup of kopi, very cheap. I bought that one cup home (I drank mine with a friend in store) and when my grandma learned that the coffee was for the helper, she got really thickskinned and took it from me and started to drink it, even though she said she cant drink caffeine after 4pm because she wouldnt be able to sleep???!?!? We celebrated the helper's bday a few months ago. I bought a cake and wanted to sing the song, blow out candles etc. The whole family joined in the fun and when I asked my grandma if she wanted to join us, she said ""no"" and ignored us even though we were literally in the same room, just like 5 steps apart. She spared us no attention. She treats these helpers like people in the olden days treat servants. She did grow up in a rich household, but even so I dont think it excuses the behaviour. There are so many small things like not allowing the helper to use the same brand of toilet paper as us, to like only allowing her to drink the cheaper brand of powdered coffee, or like blaming her for not doing things that she had never told her to do because of her owb failing memory.I want to help, but I have done all I can. I have to respect my elders and so all I can do is apologise on my grandma's behalf every time something happens. I really dont want to change another helper because it will be a repeat of the tiring teaching and adjustment process all over again.

100426,"Hi, Im not too sure about laws and stuff. But my friend sounded off on multiple occasion how they had been beaten up by their parent. The parents are divorced and living seperately. The parent they stay with would elbow them in the back, push and kick them to the floor, strike them, even destroy their belongings. On a previous occasion when they defended and pushed their parent away, that parent called the police. They arrived at the house and the abuser lied saying my friend was the one assaulting her and my friend was informed that they can be arrested when they turned 21 because that constitutes as assault. Implying that my friend has to suffer the abuse from the parent and they were not able to defend themselves from the assault. The other parent's response was that my friend was the violent one.1) Can I check with people who know or people who walked this path.., at what age does one cease to be a ""child"" (though the abuse persisted since childhood, even resulting in fractured wrists). Can police or msf intervene. Are there safe spaces for my friend to move away from these emotionally manipulative and physically abusive parents?2) What else can my friend do? I doubt my friend would rock the boat, and would probably suffer in silent. I advised them to call the hospital for the xray records of the fracture, and piece together a time line, record each date they were hit. And go to the doctor for records for their injuries. 3) Also what else can I do besides listening? To me it is clear the parents both are too occupied with their own suffering to care for their flesh and blood. They even questioned my friend what they told the doctor and told them to lied and not mention the parent was the one who caused it. This is pure neglect and bullshit. And I dont want my friend to suffer. https://www.msf.gov.sg/.../Family.../Pages/default.aspx-#100426: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100426","['Like: 4 people', 'Care: 4 people', 'Wow: 2 people']",9 comments,1 share

Im just not smart enough for sg… to be honest, ive no idea how i landed on this page. im not even from nus or anywhere close to nus. im from a college, but a ‘college’ that everybody looks down on or frown upon..

I would just like to shout out to the guy at the Sh'bam class recently at Singpost FF whom I don't know and probably will never meet again that thanks for coming up and telling me I was a good dancer because no one has ever told me that before and to be honest I was abit stunned and didn't know how to respond (hence the awkward reply and awkward exit from the class without saying bye) so using this platform to give some belated hindsight thoughts that I think it's so awesome that you were game to join in such a class that's majority female and even gave someone else a compliment. Hope you will continue with the classes  Positivity begets positivity!!!-#100420: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100420,"['Like: 6 people', 'Haha: 1 person']",0 Comments,1 comment
100418,"what are peoples' general thoughts on people who are obsessed with accumulating as much wealth as possible and berates people who does not think the same?i have this annoying new colleague who has a very kaypo character. he does trading as a side career and often boasts about it. there was once when we were having a casual chat at work and the convo went something like that.colleague: so what do you usually do on the weekends?me: if the weather is good and friends are available, we will play a few games of basketball. otherwise i'll just watch some movies if there are good ones. used to do some volunteering once every few months pre covid toocolleague: *proceeds to boast about his trading achievements and how he intends to purchase a branded car soon* i think people should be more like me, don't waste time on things that don't earn you money and you can live in luxury. and don't get married and have kids because wife and kids will only drain all your moneyi almost wanted to just roll my eyes and walk away. do people let their success get to their heads when they start earning a lot of money and think that they are better than others? i also heard something similar from an acquaintance in the insurance industry that people should always be productive and actively try to earn as much as possible. would like to know what you guys think. is it wrong to want to be live presently in the moment as long as one does not have bad spending habits? what makes these people think that in 10, 20, 30 years times, they will have the same energy or health to enjoy the wealth that they have been busy chasing after? are they really happy?-#100418: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100418","['Like: 27 people', 'Haha: 8 people']",35 comments,4 shares

100416,"Heart (Thanks for allowing to write my heart out, it was really cathartic for me to share.And thanks to Peter James Sim for your really thoughtful reply, my world seemed so much more kinder than I thought it was. Thank you for your kindness.As for the hateful comments, as I mentioned I am the villain & I didn’t get where I got by being nice so am totally unfazed by it. And if too long, then dun read lor. Lol. I would then continue the 2nd part of my story if you all would indulge me.)PS: For those who want to read part 1, its here: https://NUSWhispers.com/tag/100401A villian's standpoint (Part II)During the wedding reception, I realised that she was seated in the bride section along with all her friends. As luck would have it, I noticed she was placed right next to one of the bridesmaids. I then pluck up the courage, went to the bride & groom and expressed my fake interest in the bridesmaid & asked if I could sit next to them. The bride (who never really liked me) said dismissively at me: “Are you sure? I don’t think you are her type leh. She likes tall..”. My friend the groom then cut her mid-sentence and said: “ It’s okay lah, give T a chance.” and winked at me.With a sigh, the bride wagged her finger at me menacingly: “Ok ah, U can sit next to my sisters but I don’t want to hear any creepy comments from them.”I should be incensed at her insinuation but I was happy as a toad which found the next rock to hop onto so it didn't really bother me then. One small hop for me, but a big leap in how my life changed forever that afternoon. R and her fiancé was suprised to see me when I positioned myself between them and the bridesmaids.As I wasn't really into the bridesmaid and she clearly held contempt for me like her friend, we didn't really talk much as I focused on talking with R, all the while her fiancé having his arms around her shoulders to mark his dominance. As we talked, I dug into my memory to remember all the things she liked on her Facebook Profile, the pages she liked as I tried to guide our conversations towards common themes between our lives & the causes that she supports. I also regaled her with funny stories of our common friend P from our childhood together. As I made her laughed and chuckled, I saw how jaw-dropping captivating she looked. The glimmer in her eyes was resplendent with this particular doeful joy. I desired her definitely from the first time I met her so many years ago but if I could retrace to the first pure feeling of love that I ever I felt for her, it was at that very moment when I first made her laugh while in the arms of another man. Despite that, I swore her smile lit up the room with this undescribable wild incandescant light and everything around me melted away. Nothing else mattered to me anymore, all I ever wanted from that moment on is to make her smile. Forever. I kept dreading looking at the clock in the hallway as I knew our meeting would be brief & so woefully short. I needed to really befriend her. While her fiancé left for the bathroom, I asked her if its okay for me to add her on Facebook. She gave me a quizical look and glanced at the entrance to the bathroom like as if she was checking if her fiancé was on his way back. She looked me in the eye and said: ""I'm sorry I'm not on Facebook anymore, too many weirdos out there. Anyway it was nice meeting you, I really gotta go join my fiancé now. Seeya around!""I wish I could, I really really wish I could, I thought wistfully as she left my presence as suddenly as she had brighten up my sad little world. I had wanted to ask for her number but I felt it would creep her out if I did. I remembered clutching my fist with anxiety deciding if I should ask for it anyway but before I could rise from my table, I saw her enter a bright red Porsche along the drive way and my hope & dreams dashed into the rush hour traffic. I felt so lonely and angry as I glared at the giant cross along the hallway and I thought to myself:"" It’s okay if its not Your will, I'll make my own plans.""I stormed back into the wedding hall, fished out my work phone and found the lead bridesmaid. I rushed over to her frantically and said, “hey u know R right? I think her fiancé left his phone on the table just now.” as I pretended my own phone was R’s Fiancé’s. “Can we call her to get it back?”As luck would have it, she was in the middle of counting the angbaos so she passed me the guest contact list.Jackpot.I perused the contact list and saw R’s number listed under Mr and Mrs K. I took a snap shot of the number and returned the booklet to the lead bridesmaid. I hurried back into my car, added her phone to my WhatsApp and I saw the profile pic was that of R and K, her Fiancé in a loving embrace taken most likely as a pre-wedding shoot. They looked like two graceful swans in a mating dance and they looked so happy together.“But What about my happiness?”, the devilish voice in my head croaked. I then spent literally an hour+ in the car typing and retyping dozens of lame excuses on how I got her number, staring angrily at K’s gleeful smile like as if he was mocking me. The thought about her comment on how Facebook is filled with weirdos haunted me. I couldn’t get it out of my head as I tried desperately to press the send button furtively. I will just be seen as a creep was all I could think of. I just couldn’t bring myself to do it and have her think of me that way: The toad that I am. The unsent message sat on my phone for months until one fateful day while I was in a late night meeting, I saw my Facebook message lit up with R’s name on it. I had to rub my eyes cos I couldn’t believe what I saw. I almost fell off my chair.”Hello! I am back on Facebook cos our families needed us to post our wedding photos & I discovered security settings! Heh.Anyway I dun usually add guys on FB but since you are P & S’s friends I thought why not? I din realize u added me so many years ago. We are now in Europe & I hope you are well! The weather is amazing!” I still keep that message & look at it from time to time. How something so innocuous could become the most important aspect of my sad miserable existence. I will post more in due time and thank everyone for your patience.

100124,"Some days I just really hate myself for being introverted. Most times I’m okay with it, but some days I get lonely because I’m at the level where I’ve realised unless I overcome it, or find a truly understanding partner, I’m likely to be alone my whole life.It caused issues before as the most I can spend with someone I like and love is maybe several hours, then I need time alone to myself, every day. When I say alone I need like a solid block of 4 to 5 hours.If my energy is spent at work, then I can’t even fork out much energy to spend time with a person I care for.And I mean I know it’s unfair to the other person too.I just wish I was different on that.

100142,Hi guys.Just looking for some hope and strength.I'm a second-year at NUS and I just got diagnosed with a very rare form of ovarian cancer. Stage 4. I have a huge crush on a guy. I was working up to a confession when everything happened. The news kinda put me off a bit. I just want to focus on getting better. My doctor said my disease is curable.Does anyone have any experience dating/marrying a cancer survivor? Is there a stigma in Singapore against people with such a difficult history? I'm so afraid right now that I will never be able to experience the joy of falling in love and spending the rest of my life with another person.-#100142: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100142,"['Care: 215 people', 'Like: 79 people', 'Sad: 51 people']",42 comments,4 shares

100412,"Nurse appreciation postSaw the news on how a large number of healthcare workers resigned this year. I understand it can really be hard on all of you especially during this period of the pandemic and it doesn't help when patients or the public mistreat you ever so often. Just want to say I appreciate you nurses - I was 20 yo when I had a major surgery in NUH a year back. i stayed in the ICU for a week and it was one of the most painful and miserable moments in my life. My whole head was in so much pain and pressure like it was about to burst, I am unable to speak, eat or move by myself independently but it was the nurses that so kindly and patiently clean my whole body, feed me and did many other dirty jobs just to take care of me. They weren't disgusted but was so happy to do so.They differ so much from other HCWs I encountered that time, I was taken to the radiographers to get an x ray to see the healing progress of my fractured head. During the process, they got me to stand from my wheel chair when I lost my balance, felt dizzy and vomitted - i couldnt apologise as I couldnt speak due to my injury. As a result, their face expressed strong disgust and impatiently instruct and assist me during the x ray process. Hence, coupled with the first paragraph, I learn how to appreciate nurses and have deep admiration for them. I couldn't expressed my gratitude properly the last time but I found myself suddenly crying out of thankfulness when I thanked the nurses and I'm tearing as I am typing this.They are truly the biggest reason why I volunteer so actively in nursing homes and why I am currently pursuing to become an allied health care professional.-#100412: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100412",['Like: 80 people'],1 comment,3 shares
100409,"We’ve been together for nearly 2 years now…At first, we were lovey and you were always so patient with me and you would always tell me how much you love me, and would do anything for me. It was a really happy relationship. I would also often do things for you, buy things for you and pay for everything whenever I could.I do this because I love you. After a few months you get a little impatient with me, so you shouted at me, showed me attitude. We all have our bad days right? I had too, but you also said unkind stuff about my family and I. It was so mean that I cried, but when I talked to you about it, you gaslighted me and made me the one comforting you instead.I swallowed it because I love you.A year in, this gets worst and worst. Even though you still say you love me, you buy me an expensive gift on Valentine’s Day and spent a lot of money on my birthday, you went to the extend of worst gaslighting, physical & mental abuse. You also spent all my money and told me “I didn’t tell you to”, break all my stuffs, you hit me when you are angry, you threatened to suicide after you say mean stuffs to me and about me that are not true and say shit about my family.I swallowed it again because I still love you.One and a half years in, you continued treating me like shit and is always in doubt that I may not be faithful to you when I gave all my heart to you and would always be there for you no matter what. So My friends told me to call it off because they saw how you treat me when we were hanging out with my friends. They hated how you treated me even when I don’t tell them what’s happening between us. My family told me that if I continue treating you like a princess, I would be dead tired and they feel heart pain for me too. So they asked me, how long more can I take this?I pushed everything aside, and told them “no, she is treating me better than before, I still love her and is happy to be with her.” Even when they told me I look very very tired. I swallowed it once more because I still love you.Almost two years in, your attitude towards me just keeps getting worst… I have to admit that I am indeed very tired. I am sorry I can’t keep you happy with your wants and needs. Unlike you, I do not come from a rich family. I am also not as pampered as you are. Even though it is not a lot, but everything I have now is because of my hard work. I have exhausted all my money and energy on you and for you and now you’re still treating me like I’m nothing. You always tell me you love me, but do you really love me or do you love the idea of having someone that does everything for you? Yeah everyone loves that, but when you do not reciprocate, the giving party gets tired…No matter how much I love you and want to be with you, I have to admit that I am tired of doing this.. but I do not want to end this because I still want to fight for you.People reading this, I know that some of you guys will say she is right because she didn’t ask me to spend on her or do stuffs for her. I know it’s my own fault for doing so, but when you love someone, you’d do anything for that person right?Guys, I really need help on how I can make things better… There’s no gong tao here ok. I just treasure her a lot and she truly makes me happy, these are just the unhappy stuffs that happens let’s say 65% of the time.-#100409: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100409","['Like: 31 people', 'Care: 28 people', 'Sad: 12 people']",54 comments,10 shares
100408,"I have a long time friend of 10 years and both of us have seen one another through multiple heartbreaks, the problem is, her heartbreaks are always with the same guy. She's dating this guy 5 years older than she is and over the course of their 4 year relationship, he has broken up with her at least 7-8 times for ridiculous reasons like ""you're too clingy"", ""you're not mature enough for your age"" and come back to her again within a month or two. Ever since she started talking to this guy and sharing w me about the things he does to flirt w her, I've told her (even our group of friends have told her) to stay away from him, but she didn't listen and even got tgt with him behind our backs. From drinking w his ex gf one on one, to heading out late at night and lying to her, he has done so many red flag things but she still sees him as a saint. She comes to me every now and then crying over how she made a mistake and now he wants to break up, and no matter how much we try to get her to see how much of a scumbag this guy is, she STILL GOES BACK TO HIM. Even when she sees the way our bfs treat us vs how her bf treats her, she thinks that her bf is still good.. He doesn't even respect her! I'm beyond disappointed in her and now seeing her texts, igstories, etc. pisses me off and I wanna cut her out of my life and yet at the same time, I care too much to do that. I want to break them up for her own good but fear she'll hate me for life.Her parents are even approving of this guy without even knowing the shit he's done to her.

100401,"A villain’s standpoint (Part I)(Notes: I was writing this as an assignment from my therapist & I realised it had morphed into a short story format so I was forced to break it down into parts. What happened is mostly true & I dun think I need to prove it to u guys but I just want to get it off my chest. If you guys are receptive, I would continue to post Part II cos it’s honestly a long read unlike most NUSWhispers posts). Before you read on, I need you as the reader to understand that I am the creepy villain of my own story. You would not agree with the immoral choices I made and neither is this story of me trying to justify my mistakes. I am actually emphatic with fictitious villains, especially those who strive to bend realities to their wills but are foiled by the protagonist who are blessed with a good heart, looks etc. I always felt they deserved to win if not for allowing the audience to feel morally vindicated. I am what EDMers would call a BBFA. Being BB is a choice but to make life worse, I was born shorter than most sinkies(1.6M) & into a low SES family, conditions that I had no control over. It also didn’t help I couldn’t charm my way out of a paper bag if my life depended on it. Growing up, rejection and the cruel word “But” was a fact of life. Every single girl I ever fancied would say “T, You are a very nice guy BUT I see you more as a brother/Friend/someone who helps me with my homework etc.” Like a cruel movie on loop, it just kept repeating in my life till I was numb to the pain of rejection. Throughout Poly, Army and then Uni, I would be the lone guy in group outings where everyone else would be paired up, especially mates of mine whose families own cars. I bore no ill-will for those girls who rejected me, only at myself for not being good enough to deserve a girlfriend. Most of the girls I fancied were above my station in life & honestly I wasn’t super into them, I just wanted to have a gf so I wouldn’t be alone anymore. I never knew the feeling of being wanted & being loved by the one you love. The only feeling I ever knew was Envy. And Envy is like a flesh eating bug, tearing away at your heart and soul, one sinew at a time while everyone is happy around you. Everything changed when I first saw R (I’ll name her R) I would always remember vividly the day I first met her like it was yesterday. I was rushing to my lab from a lecture along NUS engine bridge when I heard my name yelled out. I spun around and saw it was a childhood friend of mine whom I haven’t seen in years flaying his arms maniacally at me from one of the benches. I walked over, embarrassed at the commotion and said my pleasantries to calm him down. As we were talking, I realised he was seated right opposite a lady buried in her books with her back towards me. I noticed she had a svelte petite frame with her jet black hair tied up neatly in a pony tail. Throughout our conversation, she ignored us so I assumed she was a stranger. This was until my childhood friend tapped her on the shoulder to introduce her to this unwelcomed interlocutor (aka me) to her studies. She turned around briefly without making eye contact with me to give a rather cold but courteous greeting accompanied by a fake smile. Cold & brief as it was, I felt time had stopped and the air from my lungs sucked out. I had never seen anything or anyone more beautiful than her & I doubt I ever will. Though her facial expression was impertinent her eyes sparkled with gamine charm and she had that most disarming smile which made me swoon uncontrollably. In that moment I felt like a toad in the marshes looking up at the beautiful swan flying in the sky nonchalantly, wishing it could come down to earth to have a chat in the dirty swamp. Lost in my thoughts as my friend babbled on, I had almost forgotten about my precious bacteria babies I have to feed for my experiment. All that mattered in that moment was I wanted more than anything else to know more about her. I got out of my comfort zone to ask about them both & learnt that they were friends from JC & were taking a science module together. When I sadly realised she was completely not interested in joining our conversation, I bade them farewell & retreated to my lab. While feeding my Petri dished babies, I fired up the lab computer, logged into Facebook & pored through my friend’s very long FB friend-list. My friend was rather popular & it literally took me more than an hour to find R’s profile. My heart sank when it said on her relationship status that she was attached. Why wouldn’t she be for someone so attractive? I noticed her bf then was tall & dashing & likely from a well to do family. Judging from the photos, they were very much in love but it seemed he was studying overseas. A little voice in my head whispered: “Perhaps the toad might have a chance?”. Hope which I would soon know is both glorious & a terrible thing indeed: For it make fools out of those who blindly believe in it. I found myself searching online for the module they were both in & for the timing of their lectures. I would then actually skip my own classes to park outside their lecture hall & wait for them to appear with the faint hope I could strike a conversation with the both of them again & perhaps get to know her better. I did it for 3 whole weeks but the strangest thing was I only ever saw my friend emerge from the hall alone & I would stupidly hide myself among the masses of fellow students. On the fourth week, my lack of patience got the better of me & I went up to my friend to say Hi and ask about R.He then told me she hardly ever attends lectures & would usually view them online. I guess I wasn’t the first person he knew who had the hots for his friend so he gently pulled me aside & said: “Look, We know each other for years so I want you to know I care about you. You are definitely not R’s type. To put it bluntly she’s out of your league & she’s very much in love with her BF so I don’t want you to waste your time okay? Promise me you won’t do anything creepy okie?” I could only nod silently. I was crushed when reality set in for me. I hated the world so much at that very moment. Why has Fate dealt such a horrible hand for me? Why can’t I be worthy for once? Ever since that day transpired, it set a roaring fire inside me. A fiery ambition I never knew I had. I refuse to give in to Fate because I don’t believe in it. I believe man makes his own Fate & I was desperate to change my lot in life. A toad may not be able to be with a swan but it could at least get out of the marshes. Fast forward 5 years 2 months and 13 days. I had given up my lab coat dreams because I knew it would never make me money. Not to bore you but I went and did something completely different from what I learnt in school to become financially independent. I am not rich by any measure but money ceased to be a problem for me; one less thing to worry about. Moved my folks from our rental HDB flat to a private condominium that I made a down payment for. The thing about money is that though it doesn’t make you happy, it does make feel a lot more confident. Throughout my journey, I didn’t manage to get to know R and even my attempt at adding her on FB failed & she completely locked up her account at one point. But I never forgot about her. How could I?On that fateful day (24th of July), I was invited to a Uni friend’s church wedding as part of his friend’s group. We were all assigned jobs like ushering & I volunteered to man the reception desk with a female friend of mine. At that point I was still hopelessly single & as usual I was the only non-couple friend in the group during the wedding. I was rummaging through the boxes for the invitation slips and I felt a light tap on my shoulder with a voice I heard so many many times in my dreams: “Are you looking for this?”I spun around in shock with the sight of R clad in an angelic yellow hued dress. Her hair was now tied up in a classy bun smiling at me with that radiant smile I had etched in my memories. She didn’t just looked the same but way prettier than I remembered and I felt my heart leaped from my chest uncontrollably into my throat. It was like I had died and gone to toad heaven. Happiness at that moment was an understatement. I had planned a whole series of sentences & scenarios in my head of what I would say to her if we ever get to meet again but I was hopelessly tongue tied. Like I had a big juicy fly in my throat. All I could muster stupidly was a simple: “Hi erm, erm don’t freak out but you are R right?”She looked at me incredulously and asked: “Yes, do we know each other? I don’t think we ever met.”“Oh, I am childhood friends with P whom I think you are friends with too right?  We met very briefly back at NUS.” Yes very briefly indeed I thought to myself sarcastically. She looked at me mischievously: “Yes! But I am so sorry I don’t remember meeting you. I am such a klutz. You must have a prodigious memory! Heh. Are you friends with the bride or the groom?”“The groom. We have been friends since Uni days. How about you?”, I was thanking my lucky stars for applying for the same course so I might be friends with the groom for this wonderful day to transpire.“Oh, the bride. My Fiancé is friends with the bride.”, she replied and then I noticed her eyes widened with pure glee as my heart sank back into my belly. I heard a booming manly voice from above me say: “Hi Honey, you need any help?”I turned around to see a lanky bespectacled gentleman walking briskly towards us before scooping her waist with his arms for the wedding photographer. They looked so perfect for each other as they took couple shots with the bride and groom. I tried to compose myself to make small talk and found out her fiancé was a researcher in the same field I had originally wanted to study in. They had met in grad school overseas & were planning to be married before going for his post-doctoral studies in a prestigious university in Europe where she would be joining him shortly. A University I would be contented even being a lab rat of but I knew it was completely out of reach for me. At that moment I was secretly seething with anger with that information. It was almost like everything I laboured for was for naught & like God was testing me. I remember while sitting at the pew glancing at them acting like lovebirds and glancing at the cross while glancing at the happy couples around me singing hymns, feeling so very very very indignantly angry with God. Why God? Why can’t I be blessed like everyone else in this room? Why am I not allowed to even have a shred of the same happiness you so freely give to everyone else? What can I do to earn your grace and blessing?Then, I heard that very same voice I buried inside me so many many moons ago: “Perhaps the toad might have a chance?”.

100399,"I revently came across a question.DOES EVERY PROBLEM In LIFE HAVE A SOLUTION?My answer is no.Examples1. A terminal illness. Some might say miracle exist but still what are the odds. How many people actually do survive a terminal disease. After all, if there is a solution to every problem in life, why do children still die of incurrable disease? The fact that the child died means there is no solution right? Some might say the solution is out there but humans haven't discovered it yet but how can a solution be out there if it is not discovered yet? How would you know that it is the solution?  There is always a possibility that there is no solution. 2. Breaking a trust terribly to the point that you lied so much that perosn won't believe you every again. There are 2 problems here. Firstly, personal chnage and second getting the trust back from that person. Number 1 has a solution but can a terribly broken trust be mended? 3. A human body crushed under a crane. The body would die almost immediately. How do you salvage this? There are solutions to MOST problems in the world but not all. There are problems in life that have no solution. All we can do is accept their existence and keep going forward which is not a solution bcus the problems would still exist. But there is a saving grace... Recognising the above fact would help us live happier and be better listeners.-#100399: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100399","['Like: 14 people', 'Care: 3 people']",17 comments,2 shares
100396,"To people who are often questioning about Covid19. To be frank, I do not know much about covid19 but as far as I have experienced before I worked in a place who help people to do swab, I felt a little disgusted and scared towards people who had positive before. I felt disgusted to myself being this way after working in a front line to fight for covid.So, I started to work this place where we help people to do swab, having ART and PCR on the site. Around the time of September where our covid case hike up very high, I have been seeing a lot of positive case in my work area, so eventually I got used to it seeing positive case and I realised that we should not feel disgusted or scared of people who WERE once positive, because after all especially to foreigners, they have families to worry too and they have their feelings and emotions. I have seen few case where people who disgusted and scared of being close to them when they were being tested positive, the people who got positive, at most of the time they are confused and worried as they do not know what to do to keep people around them to be safe and worried about their friends who they worked with, friends and families.But I do have seen that there are people without symptom having covid and there are people who are sick but NOT ARI symptom. After working and experiencing such work line, I do actually feel disgusted about myself for being such a lousy person for being scared of them and I felt sorry for people who have covid when they often do their best to be safe, I seen cases where they worked with their colleagues but did NOT get any covid at all. It is all depend on our immunity system too and for all I can say is, we all should try our best to overlook on people who had their positive and have recovered.Once again, I would like to tell people who are reading too. Please stay safe as much as we can be, of course to look out for our loved one, friends and families too, every single one of our lives are precious and we cant bear to lose anymore lives due to covid, it makes me feel sorry and sad after experiencing so much cases and death.-#100396: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100396",['Like: 4 people'],0 Comments,1 share

100392,"35M here. Sharing my own life experience to anyone who's feeling lost, down and crestfallen after some wrong decisions made which you had to pay a price for. I lost a lot of money due to my own stupidity and ignorance. As Murphy Law's stands, it led to me being scammed out of desperation which in turn made me lose my job. I was very depressed because I've always been prudent and have never gotten myself into such trouble. I didn't know how to get out of the shithole. In times like this, my wife helped me a lot by showing me the support I needed in every aspect, showed no mercy by reprimanding me, making me aware of my weaknesses. I'm so grateful to have someone like her to stand by me during such tough times. I also had a hard time looking out for a job. I tried to go into e-commerce but didn't succeed. I tried learning coding to make my own algorithm system and thankfully I succeeded. Today, I managed to pull through by having a decent job, holding a senior position and managing a team of two. I also wish to thank my boss to show his trust in me and for that I'll be always grateful. All is not lost if you don't give up and have faith in yourself. It can be a very tough journey and along the way, do not be afraid to seek for help because sometimes you just need that helping hand.-#100392: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100392","['Like: 102 people', 'Care: 19 people']",12 comments,8 shares
100390,"Just wanna ask the fellow girls out there for their opinion.I’m with happily attached to my boyfriend close to a year. He is the sweetest and nicest guy I’ve ever dated and I’m starting to think about our long term future together.Cut the long story short, sex was great. In fact my sex drive has increase tremendously even since we first dated.Initially we decided to something fun like cross dressing him as he really likes to sniff my bra and panties before during and after sex.At first I assume it was some thing really fun and interesting for couple to spice up their romantic side of the relationship.However, over the next few months, whenever he come over to my house to chill (parents not home) he would keep wearing my bra and panties and even spent hours trying out my dresses, tank top, skirt old school uniform etcc.  Sometimes when he spend the night with me he would wear my clothes to sleep too. To make matters worst, every time we went on dates, he would insist on wearing my panties instead of his own underwear. And recently his been going online to buy those super short hot pants that Thai bar girls wear at clubs in Thailand. I really do like him very much and this is not gonna affect our relationship. It’s just that I feel it’s kinda weird for my boyfriend to be like this as my ex doesn’t really exhibit such behaviour. I not to sure if I should help my boyfriend seek help or not.So I wanna ask the girls out here if it’s common for your boyfriend to have such fetishes or should I get him to seek counselling/therapy.-#100390: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100390","['Haha: 107 people', 'Like: 55 people', 'Care: 11 people']",106 comments,50 shares

How would you guys encourage him to seek treatment?I have known this male friend of mine for quite some time, and on the outside, he looks normal, just like any guy. However, since last year, after a breakup with his first girlfriend of 10 months, he became different. Both of them are in their first relationship.1) He would fat-shame his ex-girlfriend and told me that he wouldn't have picked his ex-girlfriend in the first place and is kind enough to give her a chance. In his relationship with his ex-girlfriend, he have countless thoughts of wanting to have sex with his ex-girlfriend, but it was rejected and he was very unhappy. Because of this, during dates, he openly looked at other prettier women and told me that he felt that other women are more worthy than his then-girlfriend. I think he is very appearance conscious of his partner and felt that he should have no problems of attracting a 9/10 women.2) He would sent me screenshots of women on dating apps and would rate them on a scale of 1-10, often either fat-shaming them, or included captions often filled with degrading terms like 'slut', 'whore', 'bitch', 'how I wish to fuck her' and so on. As a close bro, I generally close one eye on this and just generally offered my opinions, but of course reminded him to be aware of himself and not to do this in real-life.3) Things got worse when he sent me pictures of colleagues from his workplace and labelled their dressing, eg "" look, XX's dress has a very high slit, and she is just inviting me to screw her"", ""AA's boobs looks so small and flat, they are no different from a guy lol"". He shared with me about how horny he felt at work as there are a lot of women in his workplace and he wanted to have sex with a lot of his eye candies. I felt uncomfortable as I feel that it's sexual harassment and have the thought of blocking him, but I was quite hesitant to do so as I feel that he is just expressing his thoughts, as long as he never does anything that is criminal, it should be ok?4) He would also sent screenshots of niceguys getting rejected by girls and labelled these girls' actions as trashy, and love sharing memes about degrading women in general (his thoughts: women should be submissive to men's demands)5) He is open and vocal about his thoughts. He watches porn everyday and share with me about the thrills of watching porn while at work, imagining himself having sex with many different women, imagine how women looked like naked, sent me pictures of naked women from online etc. To counter this, I wanted to mute his messages and blocked him, but I felt bad for him as there is no one else for him to share his most intimate thoughts with.

100129,"Am i the asshole for getting frustrated with my in laws? I find that they really do not know how to take NO for an answer and try so hard to change me and my habits. I have been having frequent arguments with my husband because of this.On one instance, we went back to their place with my boy for lunch. Their maid cooked coconut mango sago for dessert and i happened to be lactose intolerant. The previous time i had it i had a diarrhoea for one whole day. So i declined when she was serving in. Then my MIL tried 101 ways to convince me to change my mind, even resorting to saying things like 'just try a bit never mind one!' and 'she took effort to cook this you know'. Another incident was when we were out for a KBBQ dinner and my stomach was already bursting after the meal. We walked past a drink stall selling fruit juices and my MIL suggested getting some. Of course, my stomach capacity was at maximum so i told them to go ahead with their orders. My MIL then said 'a bit only not filling one', 'now COVID period must increase vitamin intake' even though i have repeatedly declined politely.Other examples include them telling me what is appropriate to wear (to work and at home), how we should have done our renovations etc.In these situations, my hubby does not speak up for me and usually just asks me to give in to his parents. I guess he is used to this kind of authoritarian parenting but i honestly do not feel comfortable that they do not respect my opinions and wants at all.

100135,"I have no one to talk to. I’m emotionally drained.. So I’m posting my inner most thoughts here, hoping someone will read through and offer some insights.I’m a married man, 42 years old. I have 2 beautiful daughters, going 5 and 9. My marriage is going into its 13th year and I’m summoning my strength to end it.This divorce mindset has been an ‘on again, off again’ thing and that’s why I hate myself for it. So far, I have had 3 discussions with wife to divorce within last 2 years, hoping to reach amicable agreement. However, after her lengthy speech about how tough her job is, and kids will be affected etc… I thought about my kids and decided to give the marriage another chance.When we just got married, we were really a loving couple. She’d listen to me when I was down and vice versa. Emotionally, we were in sync. In the bedroom department, we had passionate sex often; the intimacy was real. We would watch the same TV shows together like ‘Fringe’ and ‘Dexter’. We would go to the movies together, no matter how much I hated the show (especially Twilight series). You could say we were like peas and carrots. We didn’t earn much but we had a cozy apartment.I guess the spiral started in 2015. At that time, our 1st kid was going 3 years old. Wife had a new job as a supervisor. So she would know some of the big wigs in her department. She would often get invited to gatherings at their bungalows or big apartments. The people there would talk about their posh overseas trips. One fine day, she lamented me for not earning enough to bring family to overseas trips like Italy, Spain etc. I reminded her that those colleagues of hers were single, with no kids in tow. They can do whatever they want.She nudged me to get a bigger place and we did just that. My dad provided the downpayment of about 190K, left behind by my late mum, who died in 2005. So I discussed with my wife to have my dad stay with us. She agreed.Around the same time, we were planning on a 2nd kid. Wife would often wanna have sex in order to conceive. Not much intimacy, just straight to action thing. In 2016, we welcomed our 2nd daughter. From that point on, we had nearly zero intimacy or sex. I’d often get rejected by her to the point where I dare not ask anymore, because I knew what the answer would be. Since 2016 to 2021, we had probably done it about 6 times, last round was in February this year.Our usual intimate conversations were gone too, being that she’s always busy at her job, even when working from home. Most times, when I come back home, I see her eyes glued to her laptop, she won’t even lift her head to say hello.My father, due to his personality, clashed with my wife. He packed up and went back to his own place in 2019. Wife hasn’t really gone over with me to visit him, its always just me and the kids, save 1 or 2 times.During 2016 to 2021, I have tried many ways to revive the marriage. I handled the groceries mainly, entertained the kids and tried to give her attention, though I must admit, it already felt really awkward at this point. You can say, I am emotionally checked out. She didn’t want to go for couples counselling.When we had our heated discussion about potential divorce, she brought up 2 key points:1) She only wanted to have sex because she wanted to conceive the 2nd kid.2) If there were no kids now, she would have agreed to the divorce.The last divorce discussion was in April this year, and somehow it involved my in-laws and my dad, trying to convince me to salvage the marriage, simply for the sake of their grandchildren. I agreed. But I see and feel that my wife still doesn’t really care about improving the marriage. She would binge watch Netflix till 1am on weekdays and 4am on weekends. I have been going to bed alone almost daily. We are practically married room mates.I guess the last straw came when she didn’t even bother to text my dad a simple birthday greeting, despite knowing well that its his birthday, never mind that she hasn’t showed up at his place for eons. Often, I’d think about my dad, living alone in his place. It would have been easier if my mum was still around, alas she passed on in 2005.It boils down to this question I have for myself -- What would I regret more in life? Taking care of my dad and kids (and be happier), or trying so hard to save this marriage and face emotional turmoil ?I know I have some parts to improve myself. For example, I often pull a long face due to needs not being met. I do try, come up with happy thoughts, distractions like working on my job more, or gaming etc. But I cant go on like this.Would I rather be stuck in this marriage OR be brave enough to simply file a divorce, no need for any discussion anymore?I dont really know how the divorce law works per se, but I hear that in an amicable divorce, the mother gets custody of the children. Its that pain of thinking that I cannot be with the kids daily that is really stopping me.For the record, I do not think wife is having an affair as I do not have any evidence. But I might be wrong.-#100135: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100135","['Care: 175 people', 'Like: 130 people', 'Sad: 119 people']",144 comments,71 shares

However, my parents told me not pursue a degree in engineering and told me to go into teaching instead because they say it's very hard for a lady to be employed in the engineering sector and the chances of me becoming an engineer is low. The reason why I felt that I want to pursue engineering is because I didn't want my 3 years of studying engineering related modules go to waste but I do enjoy what I've been studying. Please do advice me on this. Thank you in advamce everyone-#100375: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100375","['Like: 10 people', 'Haha: 5 people']",38 comments,5 shares

100153,"I am a 20yo female from malaysia and currently still a student. I have a part time job earning about RM300 a month and do not take any allowance from my parents for more than a year already. The Rm300 are enough for me but I still have to think twice before spending on anything. I never ask my parents for money unless it is for stuff like dental cares and uni fees. Not even on clothes or food. But somehow, my parents complain every single day that I only know how to spend and take their money when I request to make a new glasses because my eye power went up (my current glasses was made 5 years ago). My new glasses cost RM 300 and my mom kept saying that i should not ask her for money because im already working and therefore should pay for myself. But i am only a part timer with a full time studies in university and my schedules are full too. Also, they keep nagging me saying im a waste of money and say I shouldn’t have been born when i ask them for my uni fees( which is around RM3/4k per semester) every 4 months. My parents always compare me to my siblings which are both older than me by 8 years. Both my siblings are working and living in sg earning a decent salary. My mom keeps on complaining that they give her monthly allowance while I do not and only take her money. There is nothing I could do with my busy uni schedule and I go work on my free times. But it is never enough. I feel so useless and really sad when she says that she regret having me. I feel like she secretly wishes she never had me and only have both my siblings which can provide her enough money. On a side note, my parents are earning good salary and they have decent savings each month too. Everyday, I just hope that I can grow up faster and join the workforce just so I can depend on myself. I really don’t know what else I can do now. Am I really the one who’s asking for too much?-#100153: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100153","['Care: 40 people', 'Like: 22 people', 'Sad: 15 people']",39 comments,7 shares

100161,"How do I tell if a guy has commitment issues? Or he is genuinely unsure which is a normal phase before marriage? TL;DR, looking for genuine advice here. Am in relationship with a guy for 4 years. First 3 years were LDR, we started off with him going overseas for work shortly after we started dating (only got to know each other very briefly then we started dating shortly after). LDR was difficult as we were physically apart, and Skyped weekly. It always takes 2 hands to clap, and during times I felt like giving up, he will buy flowers or do something to make me happy. Fast forward, we have (or what I though) have settled most issues and he's chose to move back to SG to work for the past year due to COVID, the most difficult was religion (different religious background, not impt for me but it was for my parents) - he spoke to my parents, got their blessings to date etc. We discussed that once religion bit was sorted - the next step would be marriage. The greatest irony is that after speaking to them, he became very distant - he attributes it to the fact that he only wanted to talk to them for blessings to date, but it is only natural to have a timeline for things eg 1-2 years to marriage. He feels trapped as he views the next step as co-habiting and testing to see if we can live together, and only get married without a deadline. He also does not want to be forced to get married just because we get to buy a house and move in together. Because he chose to work in SG, the irregular hours has taken a toll on his health. There is no issues with unfaithfulness and he is honest and sincere, but I feel that once one hurdle is down, another one surfaces, or he will bring something up to question if he is ready for marriage. He loves me a lot - we both are compatible and can see a future together. He also says he has and will date with an intent for marriage (not player). He feels he is not in the best state to commit now as his physical / mental health and career are a mess. He also brings up our overseas dating as a point of contention now, saying he was unhappy as he felt trapped, and that because I wanted to continue, he did so to make me happy. While I appreciate that, it also takes 2 hands to clap and if he was genuinely disinterested, he would have ended it / it would have ended naturally. So, I am really not sure what is the problem here and pretty frustrated as I cannot wrap my head around his thinking - guys out there is this normal?  And is it too much to ask for marriage in 1-2 years and why is he so afraid or what is the root issue here if he feels I am the correct person for him and we are great partners together?-#100161: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100161","['Like: 6 people', 'Care: 3 people', 'Haha: 1 person']",11 comments,1 share

And i'm also sorry i did not contact you back. If i contacted you back, i felt like i would be treating you as a second option which would be really unfair to u. It would also not give u a chance to move on. And would be unfair to my bf as well. I do miss talking to u though, and think of u from time to time. Maybe being sweet to people will make them never forget u, and maybe thats why i will never forget you. I do sometimes wonder what wld happen if we got tgt. Sometimes when i fight w my bf i wonder if i have made the right choice back then. But since i did, i will live with it. But even if i were to breakup w my current bf i'll be too ashamed to contact u back because it wld also be treating u as a fallback option. my dream is to have a happy family and back then i made a hasty choice to get tgt with my bf cause i don't want to waste time anymore and its not a guarantee that we would end up together also. Wanted to write random updates in the gdocs about my life altho u'll never read but i realised i don't have edit access although i wrote a long paragraph haha. its been a long time that this has been inside me and i wanted to write it out somewhere.

This is very frustrating on my end because I do not want to feel this way and I feel terrible for thinking that he is unfaithful. Some of the reasons why I feel this way could be because we met via a dating application and finding out that he often follow girls (which made me feel like he probably still is using the application and definitely not met via work because his job). I admit that I am someone that is insecure and hence, I am reaching out for some advices/thoughts on this so that I am able to handle my insecurities and I do not want to paint my partner as a bad person just base on my own assumptions.

100366,"I'm the OP of #100185.Thanks to the people who stood up for me and for those who bashed me up, I'd like to clarify some facts before y'all continue calling me self entitled. When my hubby and i got married, the decision that we didn't want kids that soon was MUTUAL. We communicated this to my in-laws but they only blamed me for it. They started giving me the cold shoulder or passing sarcastic remarks about me having health problems that's why i couldn't give them a grandchild yet, because it is my duty as a DIL to give them one. They even said that they felt envious seeing their friends take care of their grandchildren. Never once has my hubby stood up for me and i eventually gave in because he promised that his parents will help out with the caregiving duties so neither of us will have to take a step back at this crucial point in our careers.And they ended up not fulfilling their end of the deal. I'm thankful that my mum was there to help. Sure, you may say that this idiot should just enrol the child in an infant care centre or hire a maid right? My in-laws objected both ideas. They said that they don't trust a foreign maid to take care of their grandchild (ironically they have a maid at home but doesn't even pay her the bare minimum even tho she has worked with them for >15 yrs). They didn't allow my hubby to spend a single cent if we were to send my girl to an infant care centre, citing how women from the older gens were able to give birth and take care of so many children. FYI he earns more than 1.5x of me and does relatively well with his investments.Now, is it then fair that i have to pop the baby because of someone else's wishes and also tank the financial aspects of it? My mum is also getting old and i don't wish to tire her out with the caregiving duties. The only option we have is either me or my husband has to quit our job.-#100366: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100366","['Like: 30 people', 'Care: 30 people', 'Sad: 15 people']",91 comments,8 shares

100179,"Recently, there’s been quite a number of people on my IG debating about the news regarding if MC rate should be factored in when reviewing a staff’s performance.Personally, I feel that when one is sick, one is definitely entitled to rest at home and shouldn’t feel bad about having to take a day off. This doesn’t sit well with the older generation as many are still stuck with the mindset that OT-ing and not taking MC is the ideal role model of what a good worker looks like. As such, some of my managers can be rather  impressionistic and judgmental.Sickness could come in many different forms, and I think even days when you’re mentally tired you should be allowed to take a break. But with the increased awareness of mental health issues, some people at my workplace are taking advantage of it. I have three colleagues: H, L and T and let me share short summaries of what they’re like and I would like to hear from some of you here!H is the MC Queen at my office. She’s on MC every other week for at least 2 days each time. We wonder how she can do that because isn’t there a cap of 14 days?? HR can’t reveal why and we also don’t dare to ask. When she’s not around, the rest of us need to cover her work. She gives zero fks and it’s none of her business even if there’s anything due she didn’t do it, she doesn’t care cause someone else will be forced to do it for her. But then again, if you’re really sick, the cap doesn’t really work right cause we can control your body to be sick for only 14 days? Most of the time, is due to her asthma. But… we are in a job that NEED to talk MOST OF THE TIME. She’s just in the wrong industry isn’t it? But still, getting paid for doing nothing. In this case, should her high MC rate affect her performance appraisal? L is an interesting character as he was a young and driven man who came in bright eyed and energetic. After making a few mistakes here and there and botched his chances at progression, he got a little jaded and then he began to take MC and skip work at every opportunity. He personally told me that he just didn’t feel like coming in and asked me for some favours here and there. I just help him to cover without telling anyone else but when he’s back he made no mention about the work I’ve done on his behalf and acted like he did everything. He’s also pretty manipulative in the sense that he went around hinting people that he’s on some sort of medication and cannot be provoked. He “doesn’t know what he’ll do when triggered” and that got people kinda fearful and want to stay out of his way. He also has a regular family doctor whom he frequents since he was a kid and in his words, “aiya he will give me as many days as I want la”. On days that he does show up for work, he submits half done slipshod work of extremely low quality. He knocks off early too but no one can do anything about it. He plans his CCL in advance too and gets extremely long weekends, iykyk. In this case, should this affect his appraisal?Lastly, T is a girl who wants to advance in her career and thinks she does ALOT of work. When she realised that she isn’t doing as well as she wanted, she had a few outbursts at work. She then told her direct boss that she’s having some signs of depression and anxiety. Despite everyone advising her to seek help, she insisted that seeking professional help will “leave a mark” and then proceeds to seek everyone’s kind understanding to give in to her requests for concessions. Irony right cause now everyone knows. What happened to not wanting people to know and leave a mark? She could have gone for sessions and those are confidential and no one would know. If you’re sick don’t you want to get better? Anyone who doesn’t help or give in to her is seen as trying to force her and hence, the bad guy. And then it became a norm that she doesn’t turn up for work on some days just because she’s feeling under the weather. With this covid situation, she has conveniently applied for long term mc as she’s very scared of everything now- all these mc are PAID. She definitely exceeded the 14 days. Same as the first example, no one knows how that work. A friend in HR only can confirm that it’s paid. Can’t reveal the process of how to work things out there. She does nothing at home. We are doing her share of work. Does she deserve the say pay and bonus as us?It’s not a big issue for me, until it affects me directly. I’m now on the fence for this issue as I feel that some of these people do not deserve it really. The worst thing is, a manager from another department told me that these people with “mental health issues” cannot be penalised. Are they really “sick” though? They’ll still receive a decent bonus because the company cannot “mark them down”. Can I start taking mc as and when I feel like it already? Any thoughts on this anyone? TLDR: too many chaokeng people at my workplace so what are your thoughts on whether mc rate should affect performance appraisal?-#100179: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100179","['Like: 13 people', 'Haha: 9 people', 'Care: 3 people']",16 comments,2 shares
100185,"Is it normal that my in-laws don't help to take care of my 6 months old girl at all?

I subtly tried to bring out this topic before as i hoped that my girl is able to receive love from both sides' grandparents but they brushed it off with things like 'oh it's just taking care of a kid nothing very difficult' or 'we have no experience lah I'm sure they can do it better'. Tbh, i don't think anyone is naturally born to be a caregiver but the fact that they didn't even want to try speaks a lot about their selfishness.

100188,"Just a rant about anti- vaxxers.If you have existing health conditions that stop u from getting vaccinated, i understand. This post is not targeted towards u guys but to those that are doing this by choice cause they are worried about the side effects of the vaccine on their own health. 1. There's no concrete evidence that the vaccine will harm your health in the long run.2. if you get covid and have serious side effects, the limited hospital resources have to be directed towards saving the lives of these selfish ppl when it could be better spent either letting our overworked health professionals rest or giving more attention to patients with serious illnesses other tha. Covid 19. Because resources are directed towards saving the lives of these selfish individuals, the illnesses of other individuals might worsen due to having their routine checkups pushed back.3. By not getting vaccinated, everyone has to suffer because we put a cap on the dining to make sure less of these unvaccinated individuals get covid so that our healthcare system can manage. When there is a cap on dining or lockdown, it affects the economy as a whole and tons of ppl are losing their jobs.Seriously, please get vaccinated. If its a choice that only affects your life, its really up to you and I respect that (eg. Lgbt). But getting vaccinated has impacts on the whole society.

100358,"Hi all. My boyfriend and I are in our early 20s and I have self-esteem issues that he doesn’t really know about. I have always been bothered by how “unfeminine” I look since I don’t have a sharp chin, a sharp nose, defined eyebrows, small face and my figure is not curvy. My boyfriend doesn’t follow any influencers or celebrities on social media but he is very into kpop and kdrama and the Korean celebrities he has expressed interest in look very different from me (fair skin, sharp nose, small face). Whenever we use our phones beside each other and I happen to catch a glimpse of his explore page on insta, I start to feel insecure because there’ll be 2-3 photos of very pretty women (selfies or photos of them posing very sexily) on the page. He doesn’t follow any influencers so I wonder if these photos are appearing because he searches for their profiles from time to time or clicks on these photos often. Anyway, I am hesitant to bring up my insecurities or the way I feel when I see him looking at photos to him because I don’t want to regulate what he looks at (and I don’t believe it will work anyway. At the most, he’ll just create a second account to look at such photos without my knowledge). More importantly, I also fear that my insecurities will affect the way he views me too. If he didn’t find me inferior to these women before, then maybe he’ll realise it when I admit that I feel this way or look down on me afterwards? To avoid this issue, I have been trying to act confident and unbothered when I see him looking at such photos. But even after we end the date for the day, I still find myself feeling uncomfortable and upset because deep down I still feel like I’m less than all these pretty people out there. Sometimes I even wonder if he gets off to photos of other people and the thought of it makes me even more hurt. I know looks are not everything, and I have other things to offer besides my looks, but like most people out there, I yearn to feel at least somewhat attractive to my partner? you gets?Because of my low self-esteem and poor self-image, I sometimes wonder if I am not suitable for a romantic relationship. But I like my boyfriend and cherish the connection we have with each other, so I am reluctant to let him go too. Then again, sometimes my brain fucks me up and leads me to think that he’s only with me because of how low-maintenance I am. I don’t make him pay for any of our dates and make sure to choose places that won’t burn a hole in our pockets.At the start of our relationship, he used to call me “pretty” and all but now that we’ve been together for some time, he doesn’t do that anymore. I still make it a point to compliment him and every physical feature of his that I find attractive because I think everyone deserves to feel admired and appreciated by their partner. I know the importance of “communication” but I don’t really want to tell him “you don’t compliment me anymore” because if he doesn’t truly mean the compliments, then what good are they for, right?  Has anyone faced similar issues before? How can I work on my self-esteem? And should I talk this out with him or try to work on it myself first? Would really appreciate your advice.

100270,"This is in response to #100204 - work ethics of pregnant colleaguesLike the OP, I had very bad experience with pregnant colleagues. I am a teacher and had a colleague in charge of the same CCA as me. After she got pregnant, she would always take MC on CCA days. This happened for months until she delivered. It was very obvious that she purposely wanted to skip CCA days because the day would end at 6.30pm and it would be too exhausting for her. I understood her situation, but I would appreciate it if she could be more upfront with me and discuss how we can distribute the workload so I handle the more physical demanding work while she handle the admin work. However, she just chose to skip all the CCA duties and I had to handle everything alone (there were no other teachers assigned to the CCA). She seemed to know that she got a bad reputation in the school for her work ethics, so she took long term leave and never returned after giving birth. Later on, the school assigned another teacher to my CCA. This teacher was in the same department as the previous colleague. After she got pregnant, she used the same trick and took MC on CCA days. I knew she had learnt this from the previous colleague because they were still keeping in touch. These two bad experiences made me dislike working with pregnant colleagues. I had the impression that they like to use their pregnancy as an excuse to do lesser work.A few years later, I went to another school. Initially, whenever I heard that someone got pregnant, I would think to myself, ""Let's see how many MCs she would take this year."" But the culture of this school was vastly different from my previous school. The pregnant teachers worked equally hard as before, and they would only take MC only when they are really very unwell. They even tried to schedule their gynae checks on weekends or after school so as to reduce disruptions to lessons.So I would like to say to the OP, have an open mind and don't be too quick to judge. If someone has a lazy trait, she would already be pushing work around before she gets pregnant, instead of waiting till she is pregnant. If the person has good work ethics, being pregnant won't affect how she works. Please also remember to be kind to pregnant colleagues because unless you were pregnant before, you can't understand how tough it is to be pregnant.-#100270: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100270","['Like: 119 people', 'Care: 14 people']",10 comments,2 shares
100348,"Hello guys! This is a post about my rs. I have been dating this girl for just over 4 months now. Here is a problem. She finds phone calls annoying. Yesterday i called her once because i had a sudden change of plans we had for the next day and couldnt meet her so i felt like i should call her instead of text (correct me if I’m wrong but i feel that having the courtesy to call is jus really basic things that people should do esp when there is a sudden change in plans). So i called and she didnt pick up. Instead, while the phone was still ringing, she went and texted me instead saying stop calling and it’s annoying. Srsly I literally called once. She said she only picks up calls if she forgets about a meeting or something. I’m really disappointed tbh. What if touch wood i got into a car accident and I’m literally on my dying bed and i wanted to speak to her but she wont pick up the phone because calling is annoying? Additionally, she only texts me when she needs me, for example when she is stressed or isn’t feeling well. On the other hand when I’m down, she either doesnt reply or she would say stuff that’s really unhelpful. I’m literally there all the time for her and I always reassure her that i will be there for her to support her and listen to her.Just a few days ago we planned to meet but she forgotten about it. So on the day itself i turned up at her place and she asked me to go home. And so i did. This is pretty one sided right?

100349,"I’m an NSF about to ORD in November and although it’s a happy time for most, the reality of ORD and the life decisions I’m going to have to make going forward is really hitting me hard as they’re going to impact the next 4-5 years of my life. So I have a couple of questions I’m hoping to get advice on. (sorry for the lengthy post ahead)1) It’s a good 9 months before I even enroll in Uni next August if I were to do so. How do I find a good-part time job during this period with a diploma?2) I always wanted to study overseas in uni to experience a different culture and meet new people,but the reality is I have no idea how I’ll be able to financially afford it and would feel guilty to get help from my family. Has anyone been in a similar situation and how did you deal with it?3) How do you decide your major and research potential jobs you could pursue afterwards? Also to my understanding, majority of people end up in a job unrelated to their majors so does it really matter if I’m unsure of what I want to pursue after uni?On a side note, I have a decent amount of savings and financial freedom from my time as an NSF (got about 7k in savings which is massive considering it’s mostly from the allowance a month which isn’t much), so I have very mixed feelings about going back to being a broke student. I even thought about just going to work for a couple of years instead of going straight to uni but I’ve been strongly advise against this by some of my peers I see mentors. At this moment everything is just unsure and a blur moving forward honestly.Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this post and give your thoughts/advice ????-#100349: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100349","['Like: 7 people', 'Care: 3 people']",9 comments,1 share

100277,"As I was helping my friend do his coding tests/interviews (he offered me a portion of his salary if I manage to help him get to a top tier company), I noticed that coding questions from hedge funds and HFTs tend to be harder and can get quite mathematical. FAANG coding questions on the other hand, tend to be mostly standard questions and less math-focused. I found this slightly strange as I always hear rumors about how hard FAANG coding tests and interviews are. However, it seems the tests are actually easier than these hedge funds and probably could be solved by the average CS student. Although this can be attributed to the fact that work in FAANG companies tend to be more about building scalable products that serve real people, compared to building fast algorithmic trading models in HFTs/hedge funds which probably require more algorithmic and mathematical thinking? Also, maybe FAANG focus more on diversity and thus look out for more than just raw intellect and IQ when hiring people?-#100277: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100277","['Like: 26 people', 'Haha: 4 people']",18 comments,1 share

100347,"How do I love my Mum when she calls me ugly?I'm the oldest in the family. My younger siblings are usually not home and out late studying, going out etc. I graduated last year but recently working from home.My Mum doesn't work so when we go nearby for lunch, she starts the conversation with ""Do you know that you're very ugly?"", and afterwards ""Do you know I'm prettier than you?"" This started years ago. When we used to go overseas, on the train she would whisper to me, ""Why do you look so good in photos, but so ugly in real life?"" Also when I was younger, she would ask me to compare her with her sisters (my aunties), who looks the youngest and prettiest. She cared a lot about appearance even when she's turning 55. When she invited me to travel alone with her, I was miserable as I became her 'insta boyfriend', taking pictures for her (She never did for me, ha ha. But I asked because I wanted some). I never understood, and only learnt to keep my silence despite many comments about ""I don't know why boys like you"" or ""You look like you're dying"". Actually these are little things compared to other complicated issues, like asking for 20 percent of my pay cos my Daddy asked for none, not allowing me to go out past 8.30pm (She still has issues with me watching night movies, and will shout numerous times that ""you dare disobey your Mother"" before I leave the house.) I've talked against her before and only leave me to be more verbally abused and hurt.I've been wanting to move out as well, but with threats that I'm disowning the family. And yet, I stay home, only to be a punching bag. Staying quiet and obedient has protected me the most over the years. But im 25 this year, is it time I say something? Or should I love her as she is. Does anyone have similar experiences and how should I cope with it. Working from home and spending time with her has as my friends say, made me very negative and down.If anyone is curious.. I don't think I'm ugly. I feel that I look confidently average. Im tall, 170 and pretty slender. But more importantly (or luckily), I choose not to let her affect my self esteem. I get kind compliments from  from relative on occasions like cny and weddings (and sadly face the brunt of more verbal attacks when we reach home that afterall, I'm her ugly child that only disappoints her).Sorry all, just a place to share my feelings.

The date was kind of... awkward and I'm not sure if these are red flags or not- He wanted to meet at a mall for tea but only told me the exact location (Coffee Bean) like 10-15 mins before we were supposed to meet. I was a bit late (sorry! got lost) and when I reached, he already got his drink and just told me to go get mine (huh?), didn't ask much abt why I was late- The odd thing is, I felt kind of guilty for being late, so I bought my drink and a slice of cake to share with him. He outright refused it! Saying that he's on a strict healthy diet (fasting, only eat egg white, no carb, etc). I mean, i have not met anyone who turned down an apology in such a way (is it normal? Or is it me overthinking?) -  Throughout the meeting, he also (not so) subtly talked about his wealth (watch collection, properties, startup investments, etc). He was also wearing an LV bag (or Hermes? can't rmb), gold rings., expensive watch, etc. He's a bit... cocky but i must say he's very smart. He also looks much younger than his age and has good physique. I wasn't very comfortable but I was drawn to him somehow. Also, he's very slow to txt me back, like once a day, or even less? And each time it's just a oneliner. He says he's busy and doesn't want distractions. Can someone be this busy?  Are the above red flags? Or am i overthinking? Should I continue seeing this guy to see how he's like? He says he wants to have another tea in a few weeks' time, location and time TBD. His profile is very legit, definitely not the scammer kind.

100345,"Hi, I don’t mean to sound ungrateful or rude but I need some perspective regarding my situation. Ask you, how much do you save (including deposit investments and insurance) PER MONTH? Maybe just give some general ideas because……I used to be so happy and satisfied with my life until something sad happened to me. Within a span of 2.5 years (not immediately after graduation,some time later) , I saved between $48,000 and $49,000 just in 2.5 years alone. Looking at this 5-digit number parked in my savings (and also investments and other fixed deposits) made me so proud of myself. Isn’t this good??? Then one day out of the blue, my mum asked me how much I saved. I was so proud and happy when I told her. Then after seeing that I saved “only” $49000 in 2.5 years, her face  just fell with disappointment. She spent days shaking her head, sighing and giving me looks of betrayal(???) she told me that when I was young I used to be as thrifty and frugal as she taught me to be.She is one shining example of the queen of frugality where she doesn’t even eat outside food. She thinks that the bank has made a mistake with “only” 49000 (???)after 2.5 years because there’s absolutely no way normal people saves “so little”. (???)What happened after this saga was even more ridiculous. She has started accusing me of learning from bad influence and straying from the family when there is clearly  a 5-digit sum lying in my savings portfolio. Like it’s 48,000 plus in 2.5 years not 5 years??? I am now a shining example of frugality where I have to make my own coffee at home, and even eat her home cooked meals right at home instead of takeaway and grab food from outside because wow, these are “bad”! I must not be “bad”!! I am not supposed to go cafe hopping any more because I should eat at home to make her happy! Every time I look back on my beautiful Instagram feed featuring the wonderful span of 2.5 years, I see happy memories of coffee, hot chocolate, bubble tea, desserts…all these while I still saved 48,000-49,000 altogether. My life now is so unhappy and uneventful. Thanks to this kind of house rules with this kind of savings goals, my life is like this now. I know I’m being ungrateful to parents, and I am unfilial for posting this to throw shade at my parents who raised me up well and taught me the virtues of frugality. Everyone says my parents are awesome in my upbringing because if not for them, I wouldn’t have done so well for A levels. Am I really in the wrong for thinking this way? Is 49,000 in 2.5 years really very little? Errrrr, sorry mum, I cannot be perfect like you are? I am trying hard to feel grateful. I know nobody’s parents does this but maybe that’s because they save 60,000 in 2.5 years instead of my 48,000? So that’s why their parents are satisfied?No, honestly, you reading this, how much do you save/invest per month after deducting expenses?-#100345: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100345","['Like: 32 people', 'Haha: 22 people', 'Sad: 8 people']",68 comments,6 shares

100341,"I saw Prof Ben's on the CS intake's IGP and I'm sad to see this happen to a field that I love.It shows that our JC kids are still wired or encouraged, presumably by peer and family pressure, to think of things in terms of averages rather than tails. This creates an effect where a lot of dispassionate students go into {law, medicine, CS} merely as a reflex to the average pay of {law, medicine, CS} grads. It's hard to believe that many people actually innately enjoy CS.For starters, this pollutes the candidate pool for us employers. Kind of like how I generally find a much higher quality pool of applicants filling a Rust/OCaml position than a JavaScript/Python role.More importantly, my experience is that there's a much larger tail dependence between passion and income than between undergraduate degree and income. If you're a straight A student, the conditional expectation of your income is much higher when you pick what you love!Are you a good writer, with 1-2 rudimentary CS electives, some Figma skills and an architecture degree (BCC/C intake)? A top tier UI/UX writer or product designer role will get you a much higher pay than an average CS grad will realize in his or her career.Do you have an experimental physics background (BCC/D intake) with good patience for data munging? The starting salary at Jane Street/Citadel is US$400-500k, which comes ahead of the starting salary for whatever the fad du jour is for CS jobs (Bytedance, Shopee, FAANG).Do you have good social skills and a chemical engineering degree (BBB/B intake)? The annual revenue and payout at Vitol are US$140B and US$2.9B respectively for a staff of 1,300~, i.e. the mean employee takes home US$2.2M, which dwarves the total comp of a L8 engineer at Google.I also speak from personal experience.One of my life's greatest regrets and formative experiences was picking H2 chemistry over H2 computing - because everyone was doing it - same reason a lot of you are going into CS. I liked to code; wrote my first IRC client when I was 5. But I gave in to peer pressure and was miserable. (Not to mention that the computing kids had classes in an A/C'ed room while chemistry tutorials were in some humid s***hole.)So when it came round to my second chance, and I had straight A's out of A levels, I went with my heart and majored in physics (BCC/D intake). And it had no bearing on my income: by the time I was 28 I was already headhunted for jobs in the US$750k-1.2M range. If anything, for jobs past the US$500k income mark, the mathematical skills I picked up from physics were an order of magnitude more valuable than my programming skills.Don't be miserable.

It wasn’t like that before we got married, as he used to spend more time having fun.In the past few years, all he cares about is work. Hanging out with me seems like a chore. It’s great to be serious about work, but it’s gotten to the point where he complained he used to be productive during mealtimes but now he is less productive because I keep talking to him during meals.We are not doing anything interesting or fun together. All my favourite things, I’m left to do by myself because he has no interests outside of work. He even asked me to hang out with friends instead. I have to eat my favourite foods on my own because he doesn’t like them.I tried to do something for him by cooking dishes that he likes. However, it’s never good enough for him and it’s very difficult to please him. He’d rather just eat out. I take care of all the household chores and also call when repairs are needed. I feel like I’m alone and I’m tired of always asking him to participate more. He never does anything for me or with me unless I ask.Now it feels like if we have kids, it’s going to be a chore rather than a fun thing to do together.  I have talked to him about it and he’s prepared to do it, but he openly said taking care of kids would be a chore to him, although he’s willing to. It seems like he’s being responsible but not enthusiastic. If so, what’s the point?We get along well and agree on many issues, but I just feel like I’m all by myself.

100309,"Working for an arrogant manager is never easy. I had my fair share with my ex-manager. This manager claimed that I am not a team player because she does not hear me going for lunch or ordering lunch with the team. She even referred to me as a loner. I didn't defend myself because this was the same manager who had told me months before that she is proud of me because my colleagues look for me when they are in need and she is pleased that I am a team player. Managers use the ""I am grooming you"" tactic to always find fault with staffs. The sad thing was, it was never my work she found fault with. There are the managers who will also have favorites in the office in order to maintain their superiority and they would close an eye when their favourites don't meet their expectations. I only recently found out that she does that to those who are not in her favourite list. Our morals were left hanging in the air because we didn't feel it was okay to share it with another colleague. Dont let managers bully you just because you are under them. Approach the right person to express your unhappiness and work things out.-#100309: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100309","['Like: 14 people', 'Care: 3 people', 'Haha: 1 person']",3 comments,3 shares
100310,"Serangoon Broadway SUCKS. Either someone at NUS has a cut in the business or is plainly incompetent.Anyone who has attended any commencement in NUS would know that they rent out gowns at crazy prices and they have a monopoly over it.3 years ago I wore my brother's gown (from NTU) and they physically stopped me from going up the stage. I was queuing to go up the stage they told me the gown is different and ""not allowed"". Apparently the cutting is different at the bottom of the gown. The Sembawang Broadway employees kept insisting that I wasn't allowed on stage I relented and rented a gown on the spot that they conveniently had.If not were for my fellow course mates who were waiting in line too, I would have definitely made a big fuss and told them that the only way they would stop me from going up the stage is by tackling me down. I just didn't think it was worth it ruining the mood of the others because of my own disagreement with the company.Why does a fucking private COMPANY have power over who gets to go on stage and who doesn't? I deserve to go up the stage because I studied at NUS. I'm not attending a Sembawang Broadway event. Why does NUS tell us to rent gowns from there? Can someone expose the whole shit that is going on?-#100310: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100310","['Like: 140 people', 'Haha: 29 people']",41 comments,19 shares
100312,"Is it a norm for parents to neglect the middle child? Is middle child syndrome real? I am a middle child myself and I have never thought about this until recent events. I looked back and realised it is somewhat true that my parents place more attention and concern on my siblings as compared to me. Even the little things like choosing what to eat for dinner for example, they’d ask me what I feel like having then ask my siblings. My choice is often dismissed if my siblings felt like having something else. Even during my birthday meals, I feel pressured to select something my siblings like.I am often expected to be the independent one and do many things myself. Whenever there is something to be done around the house, I am the only one that will be called. My siblings can have everything done for them and receive zero complaints whereas it’s the complete opposite for me. When selecting our higher education, my parents are super involved in terms of my siblings. They drove them around to visit different schools and sat down with them when making applications. I visited open houses on my own and my parents didn’t even ask which schools I applied for. They would constantly check in with my siblings for updates on their acceptance offers but they only knew which school I chose a week before I started classes. A part of me feels this may be a blessing in disguise as it is what made me who I am today. I am independent and able to make my own decisions. I feel like I have everything in check without having to depend on anyone. But it still doesn’t change the fact that sometimes when I think back, it feels rather sad to see your siblings being treated like kings compared to yourself.-#100312: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100312","['Like: 9 people', 'Care: 9 people', 'Sad: 5 people']",13 comments,1 share
100314,"Back when I was staying in campus, there was this girl who I loved deeply. We have similar interests (similar choice of sports, enjoy intellectual games) so we used to click quite well. Not long after the last semester ended, we even went out together to town the day before another round of dining restrictions kicked in. However, some weeks later, she abruptly cut me off for reasons I'm still not quite sure why (she refuses to tell me and just blocked me). The initial weeks were rough, since I couldn't even comprehend why someone I cherish so much would want to disappear without a trace from my life. It has been a few months now, but I still feel that I have regular (daily?) flashbacks which sometimes still make me want to pick up that phone to ask how she is doing again...I know all this is probably fruitless, and I shouldn't be wasting my time on someone who I may never be able to fully trust again. But this doesn't help to get rid of the happy memories of the time we spent together. How am I supposed to find someone who enjoys cycling outdoors, is intellectually curious, and have all the same interests and qualities?-#100314: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100314","['Like: 8 people', 'Care: 5 people']",0 Comments,15 comments

100316,"I've been a long time lurker of NUSWhispers. Many funny, heartbreaking, downright nonsensical rants have cropped up in the time I've been lurking. The thing that's been constant though are comments that display an absolute lack of empathy. Sure, the person may be a little dumb/lost/scared/whatever but surely their feelings are valid? I especially hate those comments which tell people to ""grow up"", as if upon reaching a certain age, one can no longer feel anything and must become a stoic. Just because you weren't shown any care when you were growing up in the 1970s/80s doesn't mean that attitude has to be passed on to the next generation. Human society evolves not because we maintain the strict emotional standards of the past but because we learn, grow, and care more.-#100316: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100316","['Like: 18 people', 'Haha: 4 people']",0 Comments,20 comments
100302,"I would like to give an anology about our current pandemic situation, drawing comparison of our leaders to an abusive parent. Deep down, you (Singaporeans)  want them to put you first. However, you know their heart is not in it. There is this other sibling (economy) that gets the attention of your parents. Nevertheless, you tried to communicate your needs, you tried to tell your parents what you hoped for, but to no avail. You may follow all their rules and regulations, but it seems like you could never get their approval. But when things go wrong, they would gaslight you and blame you for it. They could do no wrong it seems. You start to doubt ourselves. You start to wonder if you really did wrong. Your parents promised that this is the last time this would happen. They promised that you will live life happily again, but it never happened. Then, they told you to accept that life is just like that. And when you saw a shiny toy that you wanted (dining in as 5), you begged them but they told you it's not the right time to give it to you now. You accepted and waited. But right down the corner, your parents bought and gave this shiny toy to your sibling (delegates from overseas). You inevitably felt angry and unjust. And it was then you realized that you are in an abusive relationship. You realized this isn't healthy and you questioned yourself, how much longer can you take this?-#100302: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100302","['Like: 10 people', 'Haha: 9 people', 'Sad: 2 people']",10 comments,1 share

100288,"Now that everyone is exposing bosses, I would like to share my story. It wasn't bullying, it wasn't abuse. It's just a lack of communication and guidance that left a big impact on me. My ex boss is very capable. When I was under her, I could really tell that the other departments, especially the senior management, they approve of her skills and capabilities, and I really look up to that. I was just fresh out of uni and was very fortunate to get an offer for this position. No need say where, cos it doesn't matter anymore. I worked directly under her (Director of dept). My first task was to arrange for some senior staff to attend a talk overseas. Staff of the organisation have the chance to attend conferences to upgrade themselves and learn about newer and advanced fields. But unfortunately, that year, they couldn't make it. I screwed up. I didn't know what to do. Sure, I know how to book plane tickets, hotels and what not. But that's when I book for myself. I didn't understand, or rather, no one briefed me on how to book through the corporate route. Some said they want to book on their own, some said they want to check the flight timings then book. I also had to find for them the best prices for hotels and flights. Some even thought of bringing their spouses overseas. Then I was informed that we had our own travel agent we go to for price quote. So with all these different permutations, and not much guidance, I screwed up. 3 weeks before the talk, I sat down with another admin of another department who was also overseeing their own staff conference attendance. That's when I was informed that they have a different billing and claim structure, and I wasn't supposed to tell their staff to do the bookings themselves, or even help them book. I was stunned like a vegetable. After this hoo haa, my boss changed the way she viewed me. I will always remember her not telling me there's a corporate slide background to use, then came back to me to question me on it. I will also remember the form that I prepared for her finding its way back to me, with her asking me what's wrong with the form (I really didn't know what was wrong). I will also remember her favourite font and style format for titles, subtitles and content, after finding fault with me on this.Every thing is so inconsequential right? So small and easily resolved. But at that point in time, it was really a setback for me. I was like a lost mouse. Or even a small boat looking for a light tower to point me in the right direction. I often recount this story to my friends. I told them, I'm looking for a light tower, but my boss used a torchlight to shine. Remember the form? It was a Friday evening when she was about to leave. She passed the forms back to me and asked about it. What's wrong with the form? What's wrong with the table? I didn't know. I stared at the form trying very hard to spot the things that she was not satisfied with. Then after some guessing and gestures, I finally got what she thought was wrong. Then she left for the day. The next thing I knew, I was rushing to the washroom, already crying. But hey, there were still people in the office and our toilet was close to it, so I had to keep my voice down. I think the cleaner came in and heard my muffled cries. Looking back now, I feel silly getting upset over this. Now after having  been in the corporate world for a while, I think I can safely and easily handle them. The last I heard, another colleague of mine left 4 months after me, citing similar issues with the boss. And this colleague was a new hire with experience. I'm glad both of us have left and are in a better place. Sometimes, it's really the lack of guidance, the mindless search for answers and clues, and the silent treatment that extinguish the spark and enthusiasm in staff.-#100288: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100288","['Like: 146 people', 'Care: 39 people']",33 comments,23 shares
100290,"Serangoon Broadway is the most unethical company that I have ever dealt with.This is how we got cheated into buying a $630 30R photo that is too big to fit my shabby HDB apartment.Upselling tactics during Gown rental1) You need to book an appointment to rent your graduation gown. By spacing out viewing times, they allow themselves ample time to upsell their photography packages.2) They entice you to commit $100 deposit to a photography package with a 20% and $50 discount.3) By wearing the graduation gown and looking at the mirror and nice words from the sales representative, makes you more susceptible to upselling.4) You do not commit to a photography package only until the day of the photoshoot. This makes you think you are only to spend a small amount.Upselling tactics during Photoshoot1) Your family will put on the nice clothes first, which again, will make you all more susceptible to upselling.2) After putting on your clothes, your family will decide on the size of the photo. You do not want to make your family appear stingy or quarrelsome in front of the public.3) When your family decides on the size of the photos, the photos are placed far away from you, and large photos now appear small.4) The sales representative told us that ""Families do not get lesser than 30R"" - which is, of course, a lie and this is how we got a photo that is too big for my house.5) They offer to charge NETS with a small incentive so you cannot deny payment and cancel your credit card.Tips1) Avoid dealing with them in protest of their unethical tactics.2) Do your research and read up on competing offers.3) Make all decisions before entering their premises.4) Share this with your friends who are renting graduation gowns from them.-#100290: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100290","['Like: 85 people', 'Haha: 29 people']",54 comments,18 shares
100291,"This is not a confession, but I thought is a meaningful story to share on life, career and the pursuit of happiness.As an ex health care professional, the late Dr Richard Teo's story resonated with me.Please take a few minutes and read his inspirational story.Below is the transcript of the talk of Dr. Richard Teo, who is a 40-year-old millionaire and cosmetic surgeon with a stage-4 lung cancer but selflessly came to share with some medical students his life experience on 19-Jan-2012.Hi good morning to all of you. My voice is a bit hoarse, so please bear with me. I thought I'll just introduce myself. My name is Richard, I'm a medical doctor. And I thought I'll just share some thoughts of my life. It's my pleasure to be invited by prof. Hopefully, it can get you thinking about how... as you pursue this.. embarking on your training to become dental surgeons, to think about other things as well.Since young, I am a typical product of today's society. Relatively successful product that society requires.. From young, I came from a below average family. I was told by the media... and people around me that happiness is about success. And that success is about being wealthy. With this mind-set, I've always be extremely competitive, since I was young.Not only do I need to go to the top school, I need to have success in all fields. Uniform groups, track, everything. I needed to get trophies, needed to be successful, I needed to have colours award, national colours award, everything. So I was highly competitive since young. I went on to medical school, graduated as a doctor. Some of you may know that within the medical faculty, ophthalmology is one of the most highly sought after specialities. So I went after that as well. I was given a traineeship in ophthalmology, I was also given a research scholarship by NUS to develop lasers to treat the eye. So in the process, I was given 2 patents, one for the medical devices, and another for the lasers. And you know what, all this academic achievements did not bring me any wealth. So once I completed my bond with MOH, I decided that this is taking too long, the training in eye surgery is just taking too long. And there's lots of money to be made in the private sector. If you're aware, in the last few years, there is this rise in aesthetic medicine. Tons of money to be made there. So I decided, well, enough of staying in institution, it's time to leave. So I quit my training halfway and I went on to set up my aesthetic clinic... in town, together with a day  surgery centre.You know the irony is that people do not make heroes out average GP (general practitioner), family physicians. They don't. They make heroes out of people who are rich and famous. People who are not happy to pay $20 to see a GP, the same person have no qualms paying ten thousand dollars for a liposuction, 15 thousand dollars for a breast augmentation, and so on and so forth. So it's a no brainer isn't? Why do you want to be a gp? Become an aesthetic physician. So instead of healing the sick and ill, I decided that I'll become a glorified beautician. So, business was good, very good. It started off with waiting of one week, then became 3weeks, then one month, then 2 months, then 3 months. I was overwhelmed; there were just too many patients. Vanities are fantastic business. I employed one doctor, the second doctor, the 3rd doctor, the 4th doctor. And within the 1st year, we're already raking in millions. Just the 1st year. But never is enough because I was so obsessed with it. I started to expand into Indonesia to get all the rich Indonesian tai-tais who wouldn't blink an eye to have a procedure done. So life was really good.So what do I do with the spare cash. How do I spend my weekends? Typically, I'll have car club gatherings. I take out my track car, with spare cash I got myself a track car. We have car club gatherings. We'll go up to Sepang in Malaysia. We'll go for car racing. And it was my life. With other spare cash, what do i do? I get myself a Ferrari. At that time, the 458 wasn't out, it's just a spider convertible, 430. This is a friend of mine, a schoolmate who is a forex trader, a banker. So he got a red one, he was wanting all along a red one, I was getting the silver  one.So what do I do after getting a car? It's time to buy a house, to build our own bungalows. So we go around looking for a land to build our own bungalows, we went around hunting. So how do i live my life? Well, we all think we have to mix around with the rich and famous. This is one of the Miss Universe. So we hang around with the beautiful, rich and famous. This by the way is an internet founder. So this is how we spend our lives, with dining and all the restaurants and Michelin Chefs you know. So I reach a point in life that I got everything for my life. I was at the pinnacle of my career and all. That's me one year ago in the gym and I thought I was like, having everything under control and reaching the pinnacle.Well, I was wrong. I didn't have everything under control. About last year March, I started to develop backache in the middle of nowhere. I thought maybe it was all the heavy squats I was doing. So I went to SGH, saw my classmate to do an MRI, to make sure it's not a slipped disc or anything. And that evening, he called me up and said that we found bone marrow replacement in your spine. I said, sorry what does that mean? I mean I know what it means, but I couldn't accept that. I was like “Are you serious?” I was still running around going to the gym you know. But we had more scans the next day, PET scans - positrons emission  scans,  they found that actually I have stage 4 terminal lung cancer. I was like ""Whoa where did that come from?” It has already spread to the brain, the spine, the liver and the adrenals. And you know one moment I was there, totally thinking that I have everything under control, thinking that I've reached the pinnacle of my life. But the next moment, I have just lost it. This is a CT scan of the lungs itself. If you look at it, every single dot there is a tumour. We call this miliaries tumour. And in fact, I have tens of thousands of them in the lungs. So, I was told that even with chemotherapy, that I'll have about 3-4months at most. Did my life come crushing on, of course it did, who wouldn't? I went into depression, of course, severe depression and I thought I had everything. See the irony is that all these things that I have, the success, the trophies, my cars, my house and all. I thought that brought me happiness. But i was feeling really down, having severe depression. Having all these thoughts of my possessions, they brought me no joy. The thought of... You know, I can hug my Ferrari to sleep, no... No, it is not going to happen. It brought not a single comfort during my last ten months. And I thought they were, but they were not true happiness. But it wasn't. What really brought me joy in the last ten months was interaction with people, my loved ones, friends, people who genuinely care about me, they laugh and cry with me, and they are able to identify the pain and suffering I was going through. That brought joy to me, happiness. None of the things I have, all the possessions, and I thought those were supposed to bring me happiness. But it didn't, because if it did, I would have felt happy think about it, when I was feeling most down..You know the classical Chinese New Year that is coming up. In the past, what do I do? Well, I will usually drive my flashy car to do my rounds, visit my relatives, to show it off to my friends. And I thought that was joy, you know. I thought that was really joy. But do you really think that my relatives and friends, whom some of them have difficulty trying to make ends meet, that will truly share the joy with me? Seeing me driving my flashy car and showing off to them? No, no way. They won’t be sharing joy with me. They were having problems trying to make ends meet, taking public transport. In fact i think, what I have done is more like you know, making them envious, jealous of all I have. In fact, sometimes even hatred. Those are what we call objects of envy. I have them, I show them off to them and I feel it can fill my own pride and ego. That didn't bring any joy to these people, to my friends and relatives, and I thought they were real joy. Well, let me just share another story with you. You know when I was about your age, I stayed in king Edward VII hall. I had this friend whom I thought was strange. Her name is Jennifer, we're still good friends. And as I walk along the path, she would, if she sees a snail, she would actually pick up the snail and put it along the grass patch. I was like why do you need to do that? Why dirty your hands? It’s just a snail. The truth is she could feel for the snail. The thought of being crushed to death is real to her, but to me it's just a snail. If you can't get out of the pathway of humans then you deserve to be crushed, it’s part of evolution isn't it? What an irony isn't it?There I was being trained as a doctor, to be compassionate, to be able to empathise; but I couldn't. As a house officer, I graduated from medical school, posted to the oncology department at NUH. And, every day, every other day I witness death in the cancer department. When I see how they suffered, I see all the pain they went through. I see all the morphine they have to press every few minutes just to relieve their pain. I see them struggling with their oxygen breathing their last breath and all. But it was just a job. When I went to clinic every day, to the wards every day, take blood, give the medication but was the patient real to me? They weren't real to me. It was just a job, I do it, I get out of the ward, I can't wait to get home, I do my own stuff. Was the pain, was the suffering the patients went through real? No. Of course I know all the medical terms to describe how they feel, all the suffering they went through. But in truth, I did not know how they feel, not until I became a patient. It is until now; I truly understand how they feel. And, if you ask me, would I have been a very different doctor if I were to re-live my life now, I can tell you yes I will. Because I truly understand how the patients feel now. And sometimes, you have to learn it the hard way. Even as you start just your first year, and you embark this journey to become dental surgeons, let me just challenge you on two fronts. Inevitably, all of you here will start to go into private practice. You will start to accumulate wealth. I can guarantee you. Just doing an implant can bring you thousands of dollars, it's fantastic money. And actually there is nothing wrong with being successful, with being rich or wealthy, absolutely nothing wrong. The only trouble is that a lot of us like myself couldn't handle it.Why do I say that? Because when I start to accumulate, the more I have, the more I want. The more I wanted, the more obsessed I became. Like what I showed you earlier on, all I can was basically to get more possessions, to reach the pinnacle of what society did to us, of what society wants us to be. I became so obsessed that nothing else really mattered to me. Patients were just a source of income, and I tried to squeeze every single cent out of these patients. A lot of times we forget, whom we are supposed to be serving. We become so lost that we serve nobody else but just ourselves. That was what happened to me. Whether it is in the medical, the dental fraternity, I can tell you, right now in the private practice, sometimes we just advise patients on treatment that is not indicated. Grey areas. And even though it is not necessary, we kind of advocate it. Even at this point, I know who are my friends and who genuinely cared for me and who are the ones who try to make money out of me by selling me ""hope"". We kind of lose our moral compass along the way. Because we just want to make money. Worse, I can tell you, over the last few years, we bad mouth our fellow colleagues, our fellow competitors in the industry. We have no qualms about it. So if we can put them down to give ourselves an advantage, we do it. And that's what happening right now, medical, dental everywhere. My challenge to you is not to lose that moral compass. I learnt it the hard way, I hope you don't ever have to do it.Secondly, a lot of us will start to get numb to our patients as we start to practise. Whether is it government hospitals, private practice, I can tell you when I was in the hospital, with stacks of patient folders, I can't wait to get rid of those folders as soon as possible; I can't wait to get patients out of my consultation room as soon as possible because there is just so many, and that's a reality. Because it becomes a job, a very routine job. And this is just part of it. Do I truly know how the patient feels back then? No, I don't. The fears and anxiety and all, do I truly understand what they are going through? I don't, not until when this happens to me and I think that is one of the biggest flaws in our system. We’re being trained to be healthcare providers, professional, and all and yet we don't know how exactly they feel. I'm not asking you to get involved emotionally, I don't think that is professional but do we actually make a real effort to understand their pain and all? Most of us won’t, alright, I can assure you. So don't lose it, my challenge to you is to always be able to put yourself in your patient's shoes. Because the pain, the anxiety, the fear are very real even though it's not real to you, it's real to them. So don't lose it and you know, right now I'm in the midst of my 5th cycle of my chemotherapy. I can tell you it’s a terrible feeling. Chemotherapy is one of those things that you don't wish even your enemies to go through because it's just suffering, lousy feeling, throwing out, you don't even know if you can retain your meals or not. Terrible feeling! And even with whatever little energy now I have, I try to reach out to other cancer patients because I truly understand what pain and suffering is like. But it's kind of little too late and too little.You guys have a bright future ahead of you with all the resource and energy, so I’m going to challenge you to go beyond your immediate patients. To understand that there are people out there who are truly in pain, truly in hardship. Don’t get the idea that only poor people suffer. It is not true. A lot of these poor people do not have much in the first place, they are easily contented. for all you know they are happier than you and me but there are out there, people who are suffering mentally, physically, hardship, emotionally, financially and so on and so forth, and they are real. We choose to ignore them or we just don't want to know that they exist. So do think about it alright, even as you go on to become professionals and dental surgeons and all. That you can reach out to these people who are in need. Whatever you do can make a large difference to them. I'm now at the receiving end so I know how it feels, someone who genuinely care for you, encourage and all. It makes a lot of difference to me. That’s what happens after treatment. I had a treatment recently, but I’ll leave this for another day. A lot of things happened along the way, that's why I am still able to talk to you today. I'll just end of with this quote here, it's from this book called Tuesdays with Morris, and some of you may have read it. Everyone knows that they are going to die; every one of us knows that. The truth is, none of us believe it because if we did, we will do things differently. When I faced death, when I had to, I stripped myself off all stuff totally and I focused only on what is essential. The irony is that a lot of times, only when we learn how to die then we learn how to live. I know it sounds very morbid for this morning but it's the truth, this is what I’m going through. Don’t let society tell you how to live. Don’t let the media tell you what you're supposed to do. Those things happened to me. And I led this life thinking that these are going to bring me happiness. I hope that you will think about it and decide for yourself how you want to live your own life. Not according to what other people tell you to do, and you have to decide whether you want to serve yourself, whether you are going to make a difference in somebody else's life. Because true happiness doesn't come from serving yourself. I thought it was but it didn't turn out that way. With that I thank you, if you have any questions you have for me, please feel free. Thank you.-#100291: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100291","['Like: 144 people', 'Care: 18 people', 'Love: 14 people']",15 comments,58 shares
100293,I started seeing this girl recently. No idea what her salary is but my best guess is it’s a comfortable amount and around a third of mine. She is very nice to me and makes me very happy. Not that it matters to me but she is also very submissive and listens to everything I say. She is also incredible in bed. Here’s the weird part. We’ve been to nice restaurants twice since we started dating and she has never offered to split the bill or even thanked me when I paid. All our other dates have been free of charge activities. Normally most girls will pretend to reach for wallet on first date or offer to pay on second date or offer to get you dessert or movie tickets or something small. Or at the very least express acknowledgment and appreciation. None of that from her. I don’t expect a girl to split the bill with me but some token form like the examples I listed I think is normal. In the past I’ve also stopped dating girls if they behave like this past 3 dates. I do like this girl though and so far in all other aspects she is really good to me. What do people here think of this situation and the way she is behaving?Is there also some good way for me to bring this up? I am also concerned bringing it up might ruin the relaxed but fun dynamic between us.-#100293: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100293,"['Haha: 74 people', 'Like: 63 people']",200 comments,19 shares

My parents do still talk as my dad is still really involved in our life and education. I’m also very close with my dad and his side of the family (excluding the wife) and meets every weekend for activities. However, I found out that my dad’s wife is like 5 months pregnant currently and I’m pretty sure he has no intention of telling me that’s why he kept it a secret but I feel very uncomfortable with the whole situation, but he is not aware that I know yet. He knows that I am not fond of his wife and even flies overseas on festive occasions so that I won’t have to see her. It’s extremely uncomfortable to know that me and that child has a 22 years age gap, and also the fact that my dad may have a grandchild several years down the road and his child and grandchild are years apart. I broke down hearing about the news as it feels like my life is becoming complicated and I don’t wish to have anything to do with them. It feels selfish of me if I tell my uncles and grandpa not to see that child because of how I feel. If you were standing in my shoes, it feels like that precious child/niece position is being taken away from me and I’m being replaced.

100263,"Is there anyone who has OR had an experience with an unresponsive professor? How do you deal with it?I am in my final year, doing my FYP and I am assigned under this certain professor. For god knows what, said professor has been ignoring my email, even as we speak. My project progress is coming to a slow and I tried arranging to have zoom meetings with him to discuss my progress before I carry on with my work, but all my efforts have fallen on deaf ears.  I am not sure what is the reason for this; while I try to be understanding that my prof's duty is probably overloaded and he is shorthanded, However, a brief reply should suffice right? He used to be very accommodating when the semester starts, giving me advice and all. But now, prof is afk. To be fair, I did a google search on him and he is a high achieving academic who has many accolades under his belt, and  his works are cited more than 10000 times. So there is no doubt on his research capability. However of all the thing he can do, he chose to ignore his FYP student. The only time he agreed to set up meetings with me was only when I talked to him directly in class. (he teaches a module in my class) But his teaching part is over and Idk how I can contact him in the future.I am not sure if there is anything wrong with me for him to do this to me when another classmate is constantly getting replies from him. If anything, I have been extremely cautious and respectful, courteous even when I correspond with any professors. Now it seems like this behavior makes me look like a pushover.The only thing I can only attribute this lack of attention to is probably he is not so worried about me and want me to work it out myself, since I am pretty sure that I was selected to head his project. Academically I am pretty confident in myself, and am expected to grad with a pretty good standing. I just do not want this tardiness to affect my project grade. Worst case scenario, I may have to email to the head academic office to sort this out if this goes on. Any advice ??  P.S It was not even a technical concept, I have done all he asked and even went above and beyond to improvise my work using stuff I learnt online & that impressed him. I was merely asking him to review my work progress and approve of it before I carry on, for god's sake.-#100263: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100263",['Like: 2 people'],6 comments,1 share

100258,"Looking for advice on spouse with phone addiction.. We dated for quite a long time before we got married, so the honeymoon phase was long gone. I love my husband and I’m sure he loves me too. I would say that we are now very comfortable with each other and know most things about each other. We don’t really fight but of course there are tensions at times. He hates addressing problems through talking, so it may not help in our case.. For this phone addiction, I don’t really know what to do. When we go out on dates, he would be on his phone sometimes and ignore me for a while. When we eat without any distractions (no tv no videos), I was always hoping we could focus on each other. But most times there seems to be nothing to share about and he would immediately be on his phone or leave the dining table to be on his computer desk watching videos.  When I try to get him to stay, he refused me every time and told me that he’s bored. When we travel on public transport, he will be on his phone throughout the journey. He even willingly pay for bursting his data limit and said it was necessary. He will be on his phone the moment he wakes up (even before washing up) and right before he sleeps. I’m not like him at all. I think about things when I am alone or have “nothing to do”. I journal. I read. I do spend time on social media but not till his extent. I don’t check my phone when I wake. I don’t need a phone when I’m in the toilet. My data usage is extremely low. I’m conscious of not using my phone when I’m out with my friends. I prefer human interactions and I won’t need my phone to survive. Besides that, he’s a great man. He’s open on everything he does. I have complete access to his phone and computer. He takes good care of me in many other areas. He’s generous on me. Just that……he is addicted to the internet. What can I do to improve our relationship?

100254,"In this time when most of the posts here seem to be seeking help or negative, I thought I would share a positive experience I had. In the previous semester, around April, I got on a public bus from campus to go home one Friday. It was a long ride, but a direct one which I usually sleep/chill on.  A few stops down an old man got on and stood facing me directly. He was a few meters away but I noticed his phone’s camera was facing me for an unusually long period of time and the way he held it looked like it was to take pictures/video. When I realised it, I froze and was really distressed. I personally don’t handle confrontations well and in that moment I couldn’t bring myself to question the man or confront him. I felt helpless also because it was about another 40minutes before my stop and in the moment I didn’t think to just get off at the next stop.In my few seconds of anxiety over what this cheekopeh was potentially doing, someone came to my rescue. There was an NUS student I recognised on the bus with me. I remember him from my faculty as I always see him in singlet shorts and slippers without fail at the deck in my past 3yrs at NUS. While I’m frozen to my seat unsure of how to deal with this cheekopeh, the NUSdude gets up from the seat behind me and stands between me and the cheekopeh. Immediately, I feel a sense of relief since the NUSdude is blocking the camera view of me. I can here an audible “tsk” from the cheekopeh. The NUSdude just continues standing in the way and fiddling with his phone which I guess was to look oblivious and not attract unnecessary attention to what just went down. After another 10min the cheekopeh gets off the bus and at the following stop the NUSdude alights. Before the NUSdude tapped out he gave me a glance which I like to think was to check if I was ok. Me being stupid responded with a shy smile but we’re all wearing masks so HOW WOULD HE EVEN SEE IT HAHAHAHA. Sadly I haven’t ran into him since on campus, so I guess it was his final sem last semester. While I guess I lost the chance to thank him in person, I felt the next best thing would be to share my experience here. Wherever you are NUSdude, I hope you’re doing well -#100254: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100254","['Like: 53 people', 'Care: 13 people', 'Love: 8 people']",0 Comments,11 comments

Our house is fully paid for. She has a sizeable nest egg. I pay for all the monthly bills and give her an allowance. She does not want to or need to work and I handle most of the chores (including cleaning and laundry etc)She’s just constantly unhappy. Every day she tells me she’s upset, she refuses to leave her phone, she gets ridiculously angry with her friends and gets into week-long feuds with them that culminates in screaming matches over the phone and her venting her anger on me. She doesn’t shower or clean herself until I scream at her to and she doesn’t bother to leave her bed unless I prepare food and she comes out and gets to eat it. I’ve gotten to the point that every day she tells me she’s depressed or she’s unhappy and I need to do something to cheer her up or be more considerate of her emotions. Moving out is not an option.

This of course led the professors to ban open book exams and enforce examplify, before the student revealed that no such software existed.Professors then decided to defend said student, saying that he has done much to help the module by answering many people’s questions. Doesn’t advertising cheating tools constitute a breach of the NUS Code of Conduct? Not to mention (whether as a troll or not) he blatantly asked if anyone wanted to buy it from him. Kind of disgusted by the fact the Prof chooses to defend him regardless Prof Ben, shouldn’t such behaviour be discouraged in SOC, sure this guy has ‘aptitude’ for sure, but he also ruins the learning environment for everyone else, insulting students for not being on the same level as him openly (and the module prof choosing to ignore such comments)-#100242: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100242","['Like: 14 people', 'Haha: 2 people']",13 comments,2 shares

100235,"Hi all, I’m 22(F) seeking for some advice~ I have 3 questions & 1 sub-question. Here goes…Some background context: Despite being classmates for a few years in the past, we only started talking recentlyI have been texting this guy (let’s call him Z) for a few months and it’s not a typical kind of texting style where we text for hours (I think we only did that once) or whatever the trend is these days. It’s more of just exchanging a chain of messages about random stuff for a few times, in a day. I really appreciate our conversations because I like how light-hearted they are and the exchange of witty replies. As time goes on, it feels like I have developed a crush(?) as I feel like knowing more about him etc. However, it feels like he’s just treating me as a friend bcoz he seldom ask questions to know more about me..my question is: What’s the difference between texting a friend vs someone they are interested in?Secondly, I have met him a few times f2f too, as friends (? since we didn’t explicitly say it’s a date). He’s really nice and have a moderate sense of humour so I do enjoy spending time with him. He also offered to pay for almost everything but I insisted on splitting and even paid for his ryde and meal (which I am fine with). (!is this a red flag?! even though I did it willingly, he did say he will transfer back because he said that I paid too much for one of the meals, but he ended up not doing so - not sure if it’s because he forgot or what and I don’t really know how to remind him as well) Anyways, that few times that we met, they were not directly initiated by either of us? It’s more of through some random comments/ replies that sort of prompted the meetups. Sometimes I do feel like initiating but I know how tiring his work can be and I also don’t want to make it too obvious that I have good feelings for him. To cover up, I also keep using words like dude, man, bro etc… My second question is: Is this a crush or more of just an interest in him? I’m not well-equipped with handling these kind of emotions and I’m not really sure how to differentiate the different types of ‘good feelings’. After pondering about it for a couple of months, I feel that there are indeed good feelings about him but I have been hesitant about confessing first because I am afraid to lose this friendship. To me, I feel that usually friendships tend to last longer than relationships because if a relationship fails, the entire ‘bridge’ is gone as well unless it’s amicable etc but it seldom go back to how it was. Besides, the logical part of me thinks that it may not work out because both of us have different priorities in life. I have work and he’s starting his night classes (on top of his work).My last question is: Should I confess and risk the friendship? Or should I just go along with what it is for a few more years and see how?-#100235: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100235",['Like: 10 people'],22 comments,3 shares
100232,"Hi NUSWhispers, would like borrow your platform to bring people's attention to an unscrupulous cups and cakes company on the treatment of its workers. They have gone on headlines before for underpaying the workers. Pretty obvious on the identity of the company already. (Maybe admin can delete/amend the obvious wording if it's not appropriate) My elderly relative (<60 y.o) started working there during Jan 21, after signing a contract that promised to pay her $1600 per mth, for working 4 days per week, 12 hrs a day, with 30 mins for lunch and dinner each. Have warned her not to join this company beforehand due to their despicable track record of underpaying the workers, but she wanted to give it a try since the upper management had changed. So while working there, she was not allowed to sit while manning the store, despite having such long working hours. She persevered through with her arthritic legs as she needed money badly. 2 weeks later into the job, this company started asking her to work for 1 more day of 12 hours as they do not have enough manpower, which meant there were 5 working days of 12hrs per week. Months later, there would be instances when she worked 6 days per week. They promised to give her the OT pay accordingly. However, they did not pay the correct amount of OT pay and basic salary to her. Her basic pay was only $1315 on the pay slip, and they contributed employer cpf of $172. The cpf contribution and the basic salary ($1315+$172=$1487) doesn't even add up to $1600. And shouldn't the employer cpf be on top of that agreed basic pay $1600? She started requesting the HR about the explanation of pay discrepancies. She needed to ask the HR repeatedly to even send her payslip when this should be provided timely without employee asking for it in the first place. Zzzz. On Jun 21, she was asked to stop working without a month or week of prior warning. They cited that the business was bad and told her to leave the company. This happened shortly after she started asking her pay. What a coincidence. If the business was not good, why was the outlet still operating after she have left for months?? So she went to MOM for help, and managed to recover some of her pay. When the deadline for escalating the matter was due in Jul 21, she told MOM that she did not want to pursue any further as she believed they will have bad karma soon. My ass, look at how this company is still thriving and surviving for years, with their unscrupulous means of underpaying their workers though the highest management has changed. Should it be the fault of the middle management or HR instead? Heard that they hired quite a lot of foreigners such as Malaysians who have to work 6 days per week, 12 hrs per day for that same amount of pay too. To me, that working hours are just insane. Freaking no life. Felt very unjustified for her, and would like to raise awareness on this issue. Everybody, please boycott and stop buying their products. They should cease to exist for exploiting their workers repeatedly. Not sure how but still hope that they would be investigated so that all the underpaid workers could be compensated.-#100232: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100232","['Like: 40 people', 'Angry: 12 people', 'Wow: 7 people']",30 comments,10 shares

100230,"How do you know if you truly love someone? How do you know if that someone is the one you want to get married with and spend the rest of your life together? The thought of marriage never scared me until recently, when my bf and I started to have more serious conversations over it. My parents also started talking to me about marriage in recent months. The thing is, my bf and I haven't been together long (1 year+), we got together slightly more than a month after my previous break up with a cheating bf and we have only known one another for a month at that point. I remember telling him that I needed more time to heal and be okay with myself before I can wholeheartedly be with him and love him, but he told me he didn't want to wait too long. His sincerity moved me and the way he was respectful to everyone even the taxi drivers and cleaning aunties were inspiring, which probably influenced my decision. We clicked almost instantly and even share lots of common interests. We like the same music, shows, culture, food, and even have similar opinions to almost everything in life. So, why am I scared of marriage then? I don't know, maybe because we disagree on many things as well? We often fight over the smallest thing and we can quarrel a good 2-3 times per week. I am someone low in physical touch but he expresses his affection and feels loved through physical touch. He is a rather needy person because he grew up rather lonely and wants to meet me at least 3-4 times a week when we're both working full time. We also fight over small things like why do I have to always remind him to take good care of his own health. When he talked about wanting to propose to me, I get quite scared sometimes, am I ready to get married? How can I be sure that he's the one? How do you guys know if your partner is the one u can live with and love wholeheartedly forever? Both our parents are divorced and we don't want that for ourselves. I'm so afraid of marriage failures because I don't want to end up like my parents, nor do I want my kids in the future to suffer the same way I did during the divorce.

His family started the blame game, blaming me, him and my dad. Easy targets right since my dad’s positive. Since then, they’ve been pressuring me silently to do PCR. I’m tested ART negative every morning. In fact, I did twice ART a day just to show them. But they said ART inconclusive. Note that, I’ve no symptoms at all. And Wednesday was the breaking point for me, they wanted me to do a PCR. And me with no symptoms and ART negative for 5 days, had to pay $168 just to prove myself. And then my PCR was negative. Not a single word to say, that’s good! I’m glad you’re negative. They just shut their mouths. I’m seriously re-thinking my relationship. Marrying into such a toxic family will kill me. Lucky I wasn’t married yet. Covid brings out the ugliest side of humans. Instead of wishing my dad well, they wished we’re all positive and blamed my family. What a toxic family.-#100226: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100226","['Like: 177 people', 'Sad: 58 people', 'Care: 34 people']",77 comments,30 shares
100224,"Life has been a bit of standstill and I find myself without any proper direction. Living alone in a new country for almost 20 months is difficult, with my family thousands of miles away. Days and weeks go by booking in and out, mostly at random times. Camp (National Service) life is mundane at best - not entirely a military boot camp, but rather doing admin services (even for a combat unit). My expectations for this was very high before coming to Singapore - I was actually looking forward to learning new skills. But, it has been disappointing. I cannot see my family due to travel restrictions, neither can I see them.  Going out places, I meet Singaporeans from different walks of life - on the trains, markets, malls, and even almost any outlet of McDonald's (which seems to be quite a favourite among the locals). Greeting neighbours along the corridor apparently isn't so common (even saying a simple hello). Some respond, some ignore. The young ladies seem very fashionable, modern and trendy, but I wished they had learnt to smile more. My landlord is about the same. She isn't consistent. Some days she is nice, other days she can be a pain. From her, I learnt that people can be just nice only if the gains benefit them. Maybe this is common when living under tenancy, which is a first for me. There are days where I feel quite opposing and boring. Other days, I feel quite energetic. I try to keep busy but after all, I'm still human.... I make mistakes. Who else agrees? Sorry, I will keep it short. Right now, I don't mind sharing my experiences to anyone, at least if it makes me feel a little better.-#100224: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100224","['Care: 10 people', 'Like: 9 people', 'Sad: 1 person']",15 comments,1 share

My wife is not supportive of my decision. She is only earning 3k a month and we have been relying on her salary to pay for bills and expenses for the past 2 years. Due to covid, i am facing a lot of challenges at work (still a newbie… need to find prospects… couldn’t meet clients etc) and instead of being understanding, she kept complaining about me not bringing money home. She told me many times that she is struggling with the amount of money left for herself and that I should be doing my job too and not let her be the sole contributor of income in the family. “It is ok if you want to sell insurance.. but what if forever no sales how? You need to learn when to give up. Maybe you should try to do some part time jobs? Like food deliveries? Our priority now is to bring money back! We have a son to feed!”She wants me to give her a deadline? Like how? I am trying to meet people! Instead of encouraging me, she kept using words like “useless” “impractical” “childish” on me.I started confiding in an ex-classmate, who is also one of my insurance prospect. I told her about my wife not being understanding etc and she is really the complete opposite. Nah, We are just purely friends… she is not my type. I just wonder why cant my wife be like her? I have zoom meetings and training almost everyday and those meetings are very mentally draining. She scolds me when i nap and leave the son to her.

100213,"TLDR: Mother demands high monthly allowance from children, but won’t leave a single cent for them after deathMy mother has 3 kids, including me. All of us are working adults and have our own families (including kids). Ever since we started working years ago, my mother has requested that all of us give her $800 monthly allowance. She is perfectly healthy but doesn’t want to work. So just by staying at home, she receives $2400 from her children.Initially we were able to support her financially. But after we have our own families and kids, our spending is really high. Cost of infant/child care and domestic helper are not cheap. My brother has 3 kids in his family while I have 2. My other sibling also has 2 kids. Despite us having to feed so many mouths, our mother insists that we do not cut down on her monthly allowance. But there was a time when we asked her how much she spends each month, she said she is very thrifty and only spends a few hundred dollars. So why does she need $2400 each month? When she sees the doctor, we would pay for the bill. Even when she is hospitalised, we would help her pay for everything. She mainly spends our allowance on handphone bill, utilities bill and groceries (hence only a few hundred dollars spent). I just want to ask you people out there… do you slightly decrease the allowance you give to your parents after you have kids?Then recently we had a conversation with her about her finances. She has roughly $300k savings in the bank (most of it comes from the hefty allowance we give her). And she also told us that after she dies, she will donate all of her savings to charity and leave nothing for us. She said that doing such a good deed will bless her soul and she can reincarnate into a very good family in the next life. This means that we still have to fork out money for her funeral, which I heard can cost more than $50k.My siblings and I were very upset to hear this. We felt that she should at least leave some money to cover the cost of her funeral so as not to burden us financially. But she was very stubborn and didn’t want to change her mind. Then all of us suggested that we give her lesser monthly allowance (enough to support her needs) so that we can save up for her funeral, but she flew into a rage and called us unfilial. Seriously? Is our suggestion really unreasonable?-#100213: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100213",['Like: 3 people'],0 Comments,10 comments

I signed up for a extra credit card via Singsaver last year as a free gift (lmao) and just kept it in my wallet after with my default credit card. My dumb ass forgot about it and when I was making payment for my meal, took the wrong card out and paid for it.The bank sent a mail the next few months to remind me of the bill but I missed it due to their spam mails (and I was still blissfully unaware I had spent on the card). It was only after they closed the account and sent a physically letter when I realized my mistake. Paid the outstanding amount within a week....It occurred to me only this year that my credit score could be affected; I went to purchase my own CBS report and my current credit score is in the worse category (HH). Involuntary closure of account by the bank was the main contributing factor.I had tried appealing to the bank to remove the score for the above reasons...

100204,"I just want to rant. This happened in my previous workplace where I have left few years ago. My 31F ex colleague is extremely lazy and keeps getting pregnant literally every year so she is always away on maternity leave for 4 months every year. She was on her 4th pregnancy and I reckon she's gonna stop taking advantage of the long leave. My previous workplace was a fast faced environment that require us to constantly be on the ball but she refused to do her job and always using pregnancy as an excuse. I mean I know she's pregnant la but still need to do her job right??? It gets worse as her belly gets bigger and she just sits on the chair the WHOLE DAMN DAY without moving her ass, making other ppl do her job. I know being pregnant is tough and it's ok if she wants to take a break during work, but she can't always be making someone else do her job while she sits all day watching Facebook live during work. As my workplace is 100% women, there are others who got pregnant too and all of them followed her footsteps by being so lazy, doesn't do their jobs and pushing their work to other people. I can't even complain to the management bc the manager is their friend so there is no point. All of us just got to suck thumb and take on their extra load as the manager got their backs. If they keeps pushing their work to other ppl then can they also push their salary to them anot wth.Although I already left few years ago, I still couldn't shake off the feeling of despise when I see a colleague in my current office gets pregnant. My first impression will always be that they are going to be lazy and push their work to other ppl once their belly gets big. I know not every pregnant woman is like that and being a mom is a wonderful thing but 95% of the pregnant women I've met are so lazy at work so I can't help but wonder. Perhaps I have not met enough yet lol or they are just the black sheep of the herd, I was young then and it was my first FT job after graduating so for sure they have spoilt my impression of being pregnant bc now I don't even want to have kids bc of them.-#100204: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100204","['Like: 1 person', 'Haha: 1 person']",0 Comments,2 comments

Been with my Hubby from r/s to marriage for 10 years with kids and yes after many years of r/s, it can be leading a simple life of just taking care of kids, family and working. I'm standing in a POV in an open minded state. So my hub started off to be very close with a few female colleagues. They watsapp and even talk alot in work messengers. Initially, it was annoying and insecure that I started to have this thinking if he's going to stray or had the intention to do so but however, he was devoted to the family and still caring about me despite him talking alot to his female colleague. I then come to a few point of time, started to engage to one of a mummy friend n we talk everyday. We also talk about sensitive things like when how to make babies happily and our daily life encounters. Are we flirting? we are females and imagine, I talk to a guy like this! Then at another point of time, I had common thinking with a guy colleague on work culture and we decided to leave the company. Even after we left, we still talk to each other every other days. He's interested in TCM and we even shared which acupuncture points can be good to increase sexual drive after birth. I even know he had sex while wfh. In texts, it can sound like flirting but in fact, it is actually a way to rant or finding balance in life so when we face work or family, we don't feel so destress. I don't have hobby like gardening or sewing so, my only hobby i got is to talk to people and in this pandemic, we hardly meet people. If you spouse has the intention to cheat, here are some hints to lookout for 1. does your spouse want to meet the person who is close with? 2. does your spouse neglect you and your kids/family? 3. does your spouse typed in text that he/she has feelings for the colleague?  if yes to all the above , be prepared for the worst. if not, just leave it as everyone has their own ways to destress nn finding someone they comfort with to talk to. not just circulating around you.  i'm just sharing my POV. no bashing pls.-#100198: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100198",['Like: 1 person'],0 Comments,2 comments

It really sucks when ur wound is still open and these people just sprinkle salt all over it and act like they are asking out of goodwill. Whether I’m single/attached/married/divorced/widowed or whatever it doesn’t concern any of you. Sometimes it is really tempting to simply find a random person on a dating app, settle down and act like a normal person conforming to stupid societal norms in order to shut everyone up. (I believe many turned to dating apps and settle for the best person they can find) Not against dating apps but I think in the long run I will be the one suffering because this person may not be who I really want.

But not once did i know that i had my very last conversation with you on a night that you looked better. Nobody is ever emotionally prepared for such a conversation, especially one that happened unexpectedly. I was lucky enough that you were there to at least see me graduate and get a job. You can rest at ease now and not be worried anymore. However, there were so many other milestones that i wanted to go through with you. It isn’t the major events that matter.

We grew the business to a sizable team and as owners we could take 5 figures home of salary and dividend every month. About 5 years ago, we decided to venture into restaurants because my relatives do very well and we were looking for diversification. The deal was my partner would continue focusing on the service business while I grow our restaurant portfolio. The first few restaurants did not work out and we incurred some debts. When Covid hit, I decided to closed them down and paid the debts myself because by partners just refused to continue doing it. The Covid also made a big impact on our service business. Our clients have been paying late and suppliers have been chasing. We had to borrow money around to pay for rent and staff salary. For the past 5-6 years I have gone through a lot of things in my life. On top of financial issues, I was diagnosed with mild depression. Physically I also have immune disease that requires me to be on long-term medication. I never told my family members and my parents because my sister's family had her own issues to deal with and I do not want to bother my parents. I often feel alone and lonely facing everything myself. On daily basis, I still have to act strong and together for the sake of my staff. I have to make sure business can sustain and are profitable yet I have always been the last to get paid but the first to resolve conflicts (I am fully aware that as a business owner, this is common).  I used to be a cheerful confident person who views life as full of possibilities. I also love helping people in every aspect of life and it sucks that I have nobody to turn to when I am down myself.  I am not actively thinking of suicide but I am very very tired of living like this. Every call, every Whatsapp message makes me anxious now because they are more often bad news or problems than good. I have got help from IMH but all they did were to give me medications for months. They helped to a point but the medications usually make me too tired to work or too nervous to function well. I feel like I am now just waiting for either a miracle to strike or the courage to finally end it. I have lost all passion in life.

100146,"How to live with a dysfunctional family? My mother always sings praises of my brother in front of everyone because he earns a lot and is dating this rich girl. But the thing is, he doesn’t give her any allowance because he “needs to save money to buy a house”. And by house he’s looking at private apartments because his gf and her family doesn’t want her to live in a hdb. My mother even told me that she is planning to give my brother some of her savings so that he can afford a condo. I am honestly so frustrated when she told me this. My parents don’t even have enough savings for their own retirements and healthcare needs, and she wants to give her savings to my brother when he can just settle for hdb if he can’t afford a private apartment. And I’m so sick of his demanding gf too who can’t even understand my family’s financial situation. I cannot deal with my mother being so obsessed with my brother and his relationship. There was once when the gf was unhappy with the way my mother interacted with her (I personally don’t think there’s anything wrong because that’s just how my mother is and that’s just her character) that she ‘feedbacked’ to my brother which resulted in my bro complaining to my mother about it. She lost sleep over what my brother said and was so upset, and I ended up being the person she vented to and seeked emotional support from.  And now she even forced herself to change so that she can get closer to my bro’s gf. I’m very angry at this situation because i feel that the gf should just try to accept who we are instead of constantly “feedbacking” about us because we are so unlike her family - and now my bro is always trying to pressure us to be this “perfect” family (mentally manipulating and guilt tripping us by saying that if he falls out with his gf, it’s our fault). Thing is, we will never be perfect no matter how hard we try. At most it’ll just be on the surface. My father doesn’t even care because he just spend most of his time drinking and gambling his money away. Living in this family for 20+ years is so stressful and I’m depressed and anxious. I see no hope in my future and no hope in this family and I don’t even have any support. I tried to tell my mother about my issues (because that’s what everyone says right-confide in your closest about your mental issues) and she straight up told me I’m crazy and told me to go away. I live on tenterhooks everyday and it is affecting me a lot at work too. I can’t even interact properly with my colleagues because of my social and general anxiety-I can’t breathe whenever I have to talk to someone I’m not close with. Tldr; my family is just screwed up, doesn’t understand and doesn’t seek to understand, there is no emotional support at all, I feel like dying and I’m drowning in anxiety. Once bitten twice shy, I have no courage to seek any more help and I’m just spiralling downwards everyday. The addition of my bro’s gf into the picture just adds to the problem because we are being “forced” to appear “perfect” so that my bro doesn’t lose face. And I doubt he even cares about the family anymore because the gf is his key to escape for a better life, that’s why he’s always giving in to her at the expense of the family.

Initially, we had planned to get married in the next couple of years and to have at least 2 if not 3 kids as we loved kids. However, the bto delays and sharp rise in housing prices especially for HDB flats have badly affected our plans and left us feeling helpless. We are not high earners, me earning 3.5k and my gf 3k. We have some savings for housing but definitely not sufficient to get an overpriced HDB or private housing without overstretching. Living with our parents is not an option as both our places are old and overcrowded- I live in a 3 room flat with 4 other members while she came from a 2 room flat. We have thought of 4 options:1) Try for a bto. Not easy to get one and even if we successfully ballot for one quickly, it would take 5-6 years for the construction, renovations etc to complete. As we only wanted kids when we have our own place, we may have less kids due to our age.2) Bite the bullet and buy a high price resale flat in a good location. We can't afford to lose our jobs in that case and have to scrimp and save for the loan payment. Cutting back expenses means we probably can only afford to have one kid or have to push back having kids till we have better finances.3) Get a cheaper resale in a far location. We will face a long travel time to our workplaces as we both don't fully wfh. Means we sleep less and may be bad for our mental health idk. Or we have to spend more on grab/taxi or get a car or bike.4) Rent somewhere (room/ shared apartment) and wait for the market to cool down. We don't know if or how long this will take so it's taking a gamble.

100160,"The entire reason why parents obsess over grades is because we have created a system (and I say we but I really mean the people running this country) in which grades mean everything. They determine which school you go to, which then determines the kind of people you network with, which determines the quality of teachers, which determines your likelihood of getting a scholarship, which determines how quickly you move up the ranks at a GLC or PSD. Meritocracy by school grades (and CCA) is a flawed meritocracy. Especially the way the grading system works in Singapore. Perhaps if our system defines merit by other qualities in students, we wouldn’t have so many parents going mental over PSLE grades.-#100160: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100160",['Like: 2 people'],5 comments,2 shares
100141,"Hi Prof Ben, I am a part time master student from SOC and I come from EEE background. This is my second semester and I haven't been able to cope too well. I am currently juggling my family and job commitments together and it hasn't been easy to me. I am considering this formal education as a way for me to move towards a more technical area. I really enjoy the learning process and choose those difficult modules that can stretch my learning ability to make my master worth. But my results are kinda bothering me. Does GPA still matters in grad school as much as bachelor when it comes to job transition? And also, is there is bell curve in grad school?-#100141: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100141",['No Reactions'],0 Comments,1 comment
100138,"I feel so disappointed and frustrated with NUS Business School handling of the coronavirus. With the increasing number of cases rising in Singapore and also more NUS Business School student having COVID-19, it surprises me a lot that the Dean presses on with f2f classes as much as possible, justifying the superior experience of hybrid teaching to purely online (Not all classes are hybrid, but purely f2f). While he is transparent about the number of Business student contracting COVID-19, he is insincere in saying that 'The highest priority of NUS-Business right now is the health of our community.' He rebuts with the fact that Well over 90% of 'NUS students are vaccinated; almost all of you are young.  Both factors make your odds of becoming seriously ill quite low.  That said, we also want you to act safely so that you do not infect others.  So please, take both SMM and your education seriously.  We do.' I personally feel that this is hypocritical, priortising the health of NUS students yet saying we are young so its fine because we won't likely fall ill, so it's fine.I don't understand. Why are NUS Staff forced to work from home but NUS Business students are forced to come to school for the superior experience of f2f teaching over online? Is it necessarily true that online classes is not great (poor FASS economics students then)? We can be in classes under group of 50, but outside of class, we can only gather in 2 and dine only in 2? This double standard always surprise me, with that somehow, the classroom is magically less likely to spread COVID-19. For some reason, working in office will likely spread COVID-19 and classroom do not likely spread COVID-19.Most shocking is today (2nd Oct 2021), people were dressed in Hazmat suits, ready to enter into seminar room in MRB that were suppose to be exam venues, but last minute changed. I believe that it was likely for disinfecting, but shocking to see the severity of the issue.Back to my main rant: Can we NUS Business Student have a voice over the type of teaching format for our classes? I don't feel confident going to classes physically with the rise of COVID-19 cases... Unfortunately, this is really #topdown  Don't play with my physical health in the name of superior education, because that is unfair to my mental health too. Will my opinion even matter, despite paying school fee...Regards,A Concern NUS Student-#100138: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100138",['Like: 2 people'],0 Comments,2 comments
100136,"TLDR : 20+ yrs alone + given covid situation, I feel like my chances are slipping away and I'll be single forever. Hi Im a graduating mid-twenties(M) student here. Im rather shy/introverted in nature which led me to having only about 2-3 close friends. I do enjoy my solitude life but lately, Im feeling more and more lonely. People around me are getting attached, planning BTOs, etc. It scares me that I'll be left all alone, without anyone to share my future, my emotions or goals. I'll be graduating and working soon, and many around me will probably be older adults or people who are already married. Plus, given the current covid situation, social interactions are so hard to come by. People often say it will come naturally and we should not rush it, I understand but, in a blink, 4 years of Uni is going to be over. I regretted chasing after grades and sacrificed my social life. Currently I am trying to join as many clubs and explore doing what I love, but nothing seems to work, and I get less and less hopeful. It might be too late but I feel like this window of opportunity might have already closed. Given these circumstances, i really do feel like my pool is getting smaller and my chances are slipping away.What should I do now?

100134,"I decided to end my relationship with my 2 year bf. We had a healthy relationship. But I felt rly tired cus from the start, I’ve been guiding him on how to be a bf. And he always told me he doesn’t know how to be a bf (I’m his second gf) too. So I guided, always initiated the talk when we had disagreements. At the end of that 2 years, I felt like I’ve changed him too much. Whatever he is, was because I’ve taught him A B C on how to be a bf. He’s always the calm one, whereas I’m the one who was more vocal. He always tried to be better, and was there when I was at my lowest, but along the way I felt so tired of guiding that I felt I needed space to grow on my own. He initiated for a break instead but I was very sure I wanted out. So we ended on good terms and mentioned that we will get back when we’re both better. Then A came into my life, I told him I wasn’t ready for a relationship but he asked me 4x to be his gf so I agreed out of pressure. Throughout, I kept thinking about my ex. It’s fucked up but I would text my ex and tell him I still think of him and nothing feels the same. I even told A I don’t feel that same love I felt when I was with my ex, felt as if I couldnt love someone anymore. Then A wld always question me about why I’d always bring him up, but it’s precisely because I’m not ready. A said he was ok with me moving on, but apparently he wasn’t because he got angry multiple times (and became verbally abusive, and sexually harassed me because ‘silent meant consent) when I shared with him about my struggles on moving on. I broke it off with A and A threatened suicide etc. I just left. Then, I felt free because I had the space to really move on from my ex. It’s now been 8 months since we’ve broken up. All along after the breakup, I would text him telling him about how much I missed him. I waited under his block so that I could speak to him once more, because I still wanted a platform to speak. But he didn’t want me anymore. He told me to move on, and he has already moved on. He said has no more feelings for me anymore. And he hope I can find someone better. He said that he wants to focus on studying now (in culinary) at CIA to pursue his passion. Which I respected, and I’m even more thankful he came down for a talk (though forced to come down by his dad and sister) with me for a closure. His friend mentioned that he has an fwb now and doesn’t want a relationship. Also mentioned that he’s more disappointed than angry at me. When my ex used to reply me, he told me that at the start maybe there was a chance to rekindle things but now that 8 months have passed, his thoughts and feelings will stand firm. And he wished me the best.My plans now: Continue to gym, work on myself, be a better person (what I’ve been doing since breaking up with him since my intention was that I wanted space to grow) while still silently hoping for a chance with him again in time to come. I’m really sure of him. Albeit only 2 years, I’ve grown in honesty and communication with him. Do you guys still think that in time to come, there will be a chance with him again? I know I screwed up, and I know I’ll get screwed for typing this. I’m ready, but really, is this possible?

100132,"I don't know what to advice my friend. This might become a long post.I will say some stuff that most people may not agree with but it is the reality. Of course, there may be exceptions but they are rare. To keep it anonymous, I am going to call my friend, ""Skywalker"".My friends and I are a bit nerdy or geeky and most of us aren't really good-looking. Of course, our dating experience were not amazing or anything. Most of us are above 30 now and are in relationships. Here comes the trigger for some of you:Most guys want a pretty gf or wife and that is a fact. There are 4 things that girls look for whether or not they admit it - (in order of importance) looks, money, luck and personality. We are only going to be talking about pretty girls here and this will all make sense at the end, I promise. In general, pretty girls will get together with a rich or/and handsome guy.I had to break it to you but looks and money are pretty much the first filter. If you don't have good looks or money, most pretty girls won't even be interested in you. They won't swipe you on apps and even if you meet them in uni, they just aren't interested in you. I have had geek friends who have been in project groups with pretty girls. There are some of them who won't even talk to you unless it is absolutely necessary. There are other who will mingle with you as friends and only as friends. You will never become their romantic partner because they are already looking for someone (either consciously or sub-consciously) with a better stats than you. Personality is, of course, a overrated thing and most girls say they want personality but just ask them to show their list of exes, I am pretty sure you can see the pattern. If the girl is looking for someone with better looks or money (either consciously or sub-consciously), then, no matter what your personality is, they are not going to notice or appreciate it. I have seen guys with amazing personalities failing to get pretty girls. With the current dating apps, your looks are the first filter so there you go.I think most people have decent personalities, be it a girls or guys. It is whether or not you decide to appreciate their personality. Of course, there are exceptions. Here is where luck comes in. If you are really lucky, you might find a pretty girl who is actually willing to look at your personality but it is a very rare occurrence. Luck can also play a part by creating a ideal situation for both of you to connect. Out of all my friends, the only non-good looking guy who got a pretty girl only managed to get her because they were going to the same religious place together for a long time. If it wasn't for that, he would be in the same situation as us.Look, I know a few good looking jerks who sleep with around with girls and pretty girls actually date these people, knowing that they sleep around so much. So what personality?A little sidetrack here. The idea of having a common hobby or unique hobby is also nonsense. It may be a good talking point and you can spend time doing it together. However, I am pretty sure you have other normal friends whom you can spend time for the hobby. I have seen plenty of couples with totally different hobbies so this is complete nonsense.Time to explain why the whole talk on pretty girls:I knew Skywalker since young and we entered uni together. Before uni, we were geeks and we did not really do well in dating, especially with pretty girls, despite Skywalker having a really good personality. If you asked me, I think we did not have looks or money or luck, but we did have decent personalities, like we are just normal good people.I am quite similar to Skywalker in terms of geekiness, intelligence, etc. The only difference between us was that he was always a lot more ambitious than I am. He also had a speech disorder. At the end of jc, one of our jerk friend said that he will never get a pretty gf/wife. This made him very angry and he decided to change.He set himself the goal of getting the most prettiest (or one of the most prettiest) girl in class/cohort. He did all the common things. He changed his grooming and dressing style. He still had the geekiness but he was a lot more confident and charismatic (or at least his mindset was the fake it till you make it attitude). He also joined a sports cca which was insane because he was a computer guy. His body changed. I really thought he was going to make it.Despite all his efforts, he couldn't get the prettiest girl or any pretty girl as a matter of fact. He got lucky once and got a pretty gf but it did not last long because her friend kind of said that she was settling with him so she broke up with him within the week. He kept trying till end of uni but he just couldn't break into that circle. We graduated and he kept on trying on and off while working but it did not work. He also had financial issues so that was not helping either.About me and my other friends:Well, I did not get a pretty gf. I did try in uni but it failed miserable. I settled with a girl who is not beautiful by normal standards. She is in fact overweight and I am underweight. I think she is fine as a person. I got tired of playing the dating game so I decided to settle with her. I think her personality is fine and like I said, most people are fine and you just have to appreciate and accept whatever quirks or traits they have. I guess she also kind of settled with me for similar reason. I think we are comfortable with each other. Most of my other friends are in similar boats.The real problem:We had a jc class reunion. Our jerk friend brought up that Skywalker did not get a pretty gf, let alone any gf. He was drunk and said a bunch of other things. This made Skywalker super angry and that is when the problem came.Since he tried everything and it did not work, he decided to break the first barrier. He cannot change his looks but he can change his financial status. He said that he did not want to become rich, he wanted to become super rich. That is going to be very hard and it will take very long, possibly even hitting the 40 year old phase, which I told him. His answer was that he will be so rich, despite being 40, that he will be able to get the hottest and youngest girl, the same kind (and age) of girls who rejected him. He wants to get the thing that he did not get, I don't know how to phrase it.It sounded so stupid and crazy, at least to me when he said that. However, I did feel like I wanted him to succeed and I could understand his feelings. As a geek, I have never been with a pretty girl before. I have never even been in a circle of close friends with pretty girls. I always felt a little inferior subconsciously because of this. I have always wanted to know what it would feel like. Despite my feelings, I did try to talk him out of it but the more I talked the more obsessed he became.We actually worked in the same company. The pay was average but the company and work was pretty ok. Due to the reunion, he quit the job.He started his own company despite having financial issues. He was working really hard - no sleep, no hobby time, nothing. He was constantly stressed about his company issues like running out of cash, being behind on schedule,etc. He even started to lose hair. It was like looking at crazy guy. When covid came last year, the company died and his financial situation was a huge problem.I thought it was over. Somehow, he managed to pseudo recover a little and now, he is trying to start a company again. I mean he lost everything in his last attempt despite the insane amount of effort, stress and time. I don't even know how anyone could want to go through it again. He is just insane. My problem and I need advice on this:I mean his reasoning is still the same for trying to start the company. He is obsessed with the idea of getting a pretty gf. It is insane. On one hand, I feel like I should stop him. I know the more time he invests into this, the more he will try and be obsessed about it despite it failing a million times. On the other hand, if his company makes it this time, he would actually become rich and maybe really get a pretty girl. I feel like I shouldn't be the one to hinder his destiny at the same time. My other friends and I are mostly thinking about marriage or bto whereas Skywalker is obsessed with becoming rich. He is already missing out on a lot of things in life. I really don't know what to do. Should I support him or should I try to stop him?I know there are a lot of grammar and spelling mistakes. Too lazy to fix them.-#100132: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100132","['Like: 4 people', 'Haha: 4 people', 'Angry: 1 person']",12 comments,4 shares

100121,"I saw the post about the bf saying she's fat and I can totally relate to it. I was about 50kg at 160cm when I got together with him and now I'm twice that.I've always thought it's my own bad decisions that led me to gain weight but I've started following some plus size influencers and now I know that weight is really out of our control. I've tried all kinds of diets and slimming products but I always gain back the weight that I lost almost immediately after I stop them. Diets are just unsustainable and they trade your mental health for losing weight. Also, I have a life and I am not going to spend everyday at the gym for hours on end.My bf has been telling me to go to the gym ""for my own health"" but I know he just thinks I'm fat and unattractive. He used to initiate sex at least once a week but he hasn't initiated for the past couple of months already. I asked if he still masturbates and he says he does once a week to relieve himself?!?! It's obvious that he's trying to make me the issue when it's really just him.He goes to the gym every other day and I feel like he's trying to make me feel guilty by saying how fit he is getting now. He recently told me he could bench press 100kg and I immediately got triggered because that's my weight and it shouldn't be hard at all for a man to lift a woman right??? This was the first time I heard him talk about how much he could lift and I'm pretty sure he waited till he could lift 100kg before telling me because he knew I would be triggered by that.Of course I can't blame him fully, since society has made us all think that skinny people are more attractive. Just look at the number of plus sized female movie stars around. I'll wait.I've told him that it's his choice that he wants to hit the gym and I'm not trying to change his habits.

100117,"@#100018I have a similar story. The difference is I went to NJC but didn't finish. I was IP so I left Singapore with nothing. I moved to Illinois to live with my aunt, where I attended American high school for two years. I got a 4.3 GPA and I attended UIUC for two years before transferring to Northwestern University. I then did my master's degree at the University of Chicago.I always knew I wanted to come home to work for the SG government. So immediately after I graduated I came home. Same questions were asked, and I failed to get into most of the stat boards and ministries I applied to. They couldn't look past the fact that I'm a failed IP student. I now work for MBB consulting, doing public/social sector consulting. I got paid $350K last year.I still trust that the SG government knows what they're doing. If they want academically flawless students to lead the government, I hope they have an explanation for why it is appropriate. I was very lazy in school but I don't think I'm below-average in competence.

100112,"FYI, pregnancy test kits are easily accessible nowadays. However, my friend had a horrible nightmare dating this girl because her whole family created multiple Instagram accounts and spam calls and text him every day due to a pregnancy scare which neither of them agree to get a pregnancy test kit. Please read on, the story is long ahead. Like how usual a relationship goes, sex comes as part of it for most people. Being the responsible one, my friend rejected his ex GF at first as he did not bring a condom. But the girl begged and begged him to, he gave in after multiple threats and guilt-tripping done by the girl. It was a consensual act. So as we all know how the story goes, the girl got paranoid and was worried she may get pregnant because it was near her period date and she thought she got pregnant.  She also did not want to get a pregnancy test kit. Out of insanity, she told her mum and aunt and the duo dragged her to a gynaecologist ae for a checkup. Tada, the next day her period came. It got even crazier when the trio decided to march down to a temple and sought help from the medium (who claims to wear a black coloured mask make people catch COVID, use eucalyptus oil to prevent COVID), the medium mention that if my friend’s ex GF did not spill the beans, she may have gotten pregnant and the????? Logic has left the chat here. The torment did not end here. My friend decided to end it because the medium was the last straw in him. The trio spams text and call him every day, create multiple Instagram account and even hacked into his Instagram account because he tried to cut off contacts. They blame it all on him, lament that he is selfish and did not think about the girl as she has a bright future ahead. He had many mental breakdowns and sleepless nights. But alas it quietened down lately but we are still unsure when the trio will strike again. So men beware who you date….

She keeps testing me, fighting with me over trivial arguments to see if I will apologise first, when these arguments don't even need to start in the first place. Most of the time I do apologise, but when I don't, she uses it to guilt trip me, saying things like ""sorry I'm a bad girlfriend"" and all... She also can't seem to understand that I need my own time alone as well, just to watch videos or play games. She wants to keep texting and texting and texting me, and I wouldn't dare to ask her to stop because she would get angry, so I let her... My life now is literally work, and texting her until I have to sleep, I can't get time for anything else. We go out on dates every Friday night after work and occasionally more, but she still pushes to go on even more dates. Immediately after our dates, she tells me she misses me and wants to see me again. I try to put it nicely to her that work is tiring, and minus sleep time and the time I take to go out with her and text/call her, I literally only have a few hours left for myself every week. She gets angry whenever I say I don't want to go out, saying things like ""Oh, I guess I'm just not that important to you"" and stuff like that.I also never thought I'd say this, but her sex drive is insane. She is constantly texting about sexual things which I shall not go into detail, and she gets extremely mad when I stop replying... Many times I would come home from work tired as hell, and she starts sexual texts, but I will force myself not to sleep and just play along with her, fearing that she will be angry with me.Can I get a third persons perspective on this?

100100,"This is with regards to the instructions from NUS business school about tightening safe management measures.I would like to start by agreeing that examinations should be taken in person but F2F lessons should be an option rather than an obligation.Firstly, I believe that most universities, SMU, NTU and SIT have already shifted their lessons online. The Dean's email mentioned that F2F classes are far more effective than online learning - Yes, I definitely agree. However, given the rising COVID-19 cases (1.9k cases on 26 Sept 2021), is it right for us to risk everyone's life? I understand vaccination helps to lower the chance of serious illness; however, some of our family members including the elderly can still contract serious illnesses if they get infected with COVID-19. In addition, those of us who have younger siblings that are unvaccinated might contract COVID-19 from us. Is the school being responsible for making us hazards to our family?Given that the government has already started restrictions of less than 2 people in social gatherings and even WFH for employees, why do NUS Business students not have a single right to attend lessons at home? When the government is asking us to stay at home, the school is asking us to head out to classes and gatherings of 50 people.The email explicitly states and I quote: ""Students do not have the option to move to 100% online without instructor permission for a valid reason (such as being outside the country, QO, SHN, LOA, MC, or illness and Instructors do not have the option to teach 100% online without decanal permission."" Now with the spike in cases, do we not have the basic right to be cautious and take lessons at home except if we have ""QO, SHN, LOA, MC, or illness""?Next, in SMU, surveys are given per module to ask if students would like to take lessons online or F2F. Here at NUS Business, we have no such survey and somehow the school deems us to ""prefer"" F2F lessons. Ironic how we always call ourselves world class, but we do not have a single on the ground feedback that other universities provide.Lastly, on the circular sent by OSHE under section 1(vii)(1), ""Essential work-related events can proceed in person if they CANNOT be converted fully virtual but to be capped at 50 persons."" Being in Business School and attending seminars, ""essential work-related events"" is definitely debatable. The question once again is whether it truly is ""essential""?: we have no hands-on experiences; group discussions can be held through breakout rooms on zoom. Lessons definitely can be converted to virtual ones since we have done it before.I genuinely hope that these issues can be looked at once again from a bottom-up perspective rather than a top-down management approach.P.S I have sent this email out to seek help from NUS but there was no response, hope someone can help us students out since most of us are afraid that sounding out will have serious repercussions on our grades if we were to be singled out.-#100100: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100100","['Like: 6 people', 'Haha: 1 person']",0 Comments,2 comments
100092,"To Dean of NUS Business School:Is the health of the NUS Business students important to you? The government has started implementing restrictions on dining in admist the very high community spread. Social gathering are also discouraged.Despite this, the students of NUS Business school have been advised that they are NOT allowed to attend classes 100% online.Quoted from the memo of the dean to students ""Students do not have the option to move to online lessons unless you are on MC, QO, LOA, SHN"".

100090,"I'm stress and would want to rant , at the same time gather some opinions. I am house wife with 1 kid and 1 infant. Had a fight with my husband about him going out with his friends last Friday, I told him not to because of increasing covid cases and having 2 small kids at home it’s too risky, initially he said ok, but when they announced about social gathering restrictions to 2, he got frustrated and started blaming me for ruining his plans. And even knowing the risk, he went to party with his friends on this evening and followed by dinner leaving me with 2 kids at home to manage, in that one is 3 months old. These friends are partying very frequently, not like they met after ages kind, they just had party 2 weeks before , that time also it was Sunday evening. He left at 4pm and came back home at midnight after the kids slept. I am exhausted and frustrated being like this . Even after hinting him that as we both are fully vaccinated, so can go out n eat, he says he busy with office work, but with friends he wants to go out. I last dine in was May 2021, it’s been 4 months already but he is not bothered to take me out, and moreover frustrated on me for not letting him go out with his friends. Last month on his birthday also his friends came on midnight to celebrate like cake cutting and all, then on bday evening also they want to party , I said no as I want him to spending time with us family, as the new baby came into our life’s and wanted to spend time as a family of 4, but he is not happy about that too. Is it like am I the only one want to have a family time, is he not bothered? Am I the only one responsible or worried about keeping family safe , is he not bothered?

100082,"Similar case as #99991 but probably worseAfew months ago, noticed the same name keep popping out my wife's mobile and when i tried to check the phone, i realize that the history was only up to a day ago and im sure they been chatting way before that, and the content was although mind but not colleague r/s, is chatting about ""what are you doing now?"", ""what you ate for lunch/dinner"", ""wah your picture on FB quite pretty hor"". I confronted my wife and she initially deny but say that guy is only a colleague and just random chatting and he is doing that to many other female colleagues and she has no feeling for him, just responding out of boredom plus I have been neglecting her due to work. She promise to cut contact with him and only talk about work, and will make clear to him to not text so much. I decided to trust her, and I made alot changes to spend more time with her and less work and OT when at home, she also acknowledge my effort and claimed that she appreciated it, and life moves on. After couple months, while she didn't off her PC, I peep into her log with tt guy, and realize they been chatting on a daily basis, the amount of chat in Teams didn't lessen when I first confronted her, she say to dont whatsapp at night (I believe she delete the whatsapp chat). And the chat content includes daily life activities, ranting about our quarrels to him, and some flirt content, of course work and office gossip. I was very upset, confronted her again, and now her excuse is that she is trying to get his attention in hope for a better impression and evaluation for her appraisal. Do note that they are from different department, even though he is a head of another department and could help her in her ranking. I find it bullish though. She keep claiming that is just normal colleague, and no feeling and just trying to get his attention and she know she is in the wrong but promise not to do that anymore, she will cut all contact and stuff. I really want to believe her, but what normal colleague will chat every day, talk about daily activities, flirt, and keep ranting about the husband? btw the colleague is also married with kids.We been married for almost 8 years with kids, what should I do?

100074,"Hi guys, would need advice on whether I should stay in a ""relationship"" that I deem as toxic.Basically, I'm not officially in a relationship with this guy but we've been together for almost 2 years. We fight so often & many times, the fights are very intense & aggressive. When things escalate, he would usually shout at me while standing close to me & face down to me (i don't really know how to describe his stance; but it's an aggressive stance). When he does this, I wouldn't even back down & would face him head on and fight it out with him (i admit my words can be too harsh during these kind of fights & note that my temper are really bad so sometimes i maybe the one that escalated the fight). But ya, he raised his hands during a few of these fights but have never actually laid hands on me. He'd usually end up throwing my stuff across the room, snatching my phone away to make me stay (because i'd usually try to leave the room & get away from him), or he'd smash stuff. Just to note, he does not raise his hand/ throw or smash stuff/ snatch my phone in every single fight. It's only during these very intense ones, but these happened probably more than 6-7 times during the 2 years - and 1 time in public. Other than these intense fights, we also have very frequent long & random fights (heated but not as intense as the above). These are the things that I can't accept but at the same time, when things are good he'd be really very nice to me. He'd always tolerate me & gives in to me. He'd buy me stuff that I wanted to purchase myself to surprise me when I asked him for opinions on which item is nicer. He'd also always bring me to eat any food that I'm craving for & does many things that I want. Honestly, I would really settle down with him if not for the above stuff. I just don't want to end up giving him a chance to actually hit me when our fight gets too intense? And I find that we fight way too often & too intensely with either willing to back down?Oh on a side note, he snores REALLY loudly every night which disrupts my sleep so badly that I feel like murdering him sometimes. Any advice on how to make him stop snoring so that I can get some decent sleep when I'm with him would be greatly appreciated please!-#100074: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100074","['Like: 16 people', 'Haha: 14 people', 'Sad: 8 people']",55 comments,3 shares
100067,"My boyfriend is older than me. He is working full time while I am doing my own business. However, my income is about 3-4 times more than his. I didn’t think this would matter at first because he is a very nice man in general… He speaks politely to the elders, he is a responsible and loyal man and he is also very good with house chores (even better than I am).But as time goes by, our arguments started revolving around money. When we go for meals together, he will always tell me restaurants are overpriced, we should stick to hawker centre food. I am okay and happy with it. But.. it was so rare for us to eat in restaurants. Sometimes, when business is good and I want to reward myself, I would suggest eating out at a fairly expensive restaurant (bill maybe adds up to about $60-$80). And it hurts me when I see him looking through the menu & not really happy to eat there because it is expensive. But once I offer to pay, he will order more than usual and even start complaining about the food while we are eating.. Like how it tastes just like hawker food so not worth it to pay more blabla…Since the start of our relationship, he has been a very frugal person, while I usually don’t really look into the dollars and cents when I buy something (I do have an ok amount of savings for my age and I don’t live from paycheck to paycheck). But I was also surprised when he started documenting down all our expenses in a table form and he will even record down to the cents for all of our expenses.. Our typical practice is he pays for everything first then end of the month we split them down to 50-50. I was also initially okay with this arrangement. And also thought that he is very nice to offer to pay 50% even though he earns significantly lesser. But what I couldn’t accept was that every single expense was 50-50. Sometimes when I look at something that I really wanted to buy (e.g. A piece of cake/ A cup of coffee), he will rarely offer to buy it for me as a treat and he will just stand there and watch me take out my wallet to pay.. Or when he does, he will start to pull that out during our quarrels to prove that he is generous. I also will buy things for his parents during occasions like their birthdays, father’s/mother’s day, cny, etc. But he has never bought my parents any gifts besides some food he brings over sometimes when he visits. Sometimes, when I am bothered by it, I do sit him down and speak to him about it. I also asked if it’s okay to not count everything down to dollars and cents e.g. he could try paying for one meal while i pay for the next. doesn’t matter who pays more, let’s not be so calculative to each other about it since we are a couple. but he hasn’t been receptive towards it and he thinks his way of doing things is fair. he will then start talking about how he has certain limitations like his job doesn’t pay him that much what can he do, i earn more so i should be able to pay for my own things. He also doesn’t dream of earning big. He is a very contented person and he is happy with his current income, he doesn’t see a need to earn more. Just last week, he popped the question.. I do love him a lot but these thoughts will always be at the back of my head.

100058,"Recently my boyfriend has been commenting a lot on my appearance and to be honest, it is really bothering me. He’s been pushing for me to lose weight, constantly hinting that I’m eating way too much and I actually start to feel conscious about my own behaviour around him. I’d admit I have gained weight since the first time we met (it’s been about 7 years) but I am not overweight.. there are a few occasions where he basically said I am fat and could look better. Hearing those words of course made me upset and he knows from my reaction which is why I don’t get why he continues to say it. He values physical appearance a lot and is always telling me that I need to start losing weight now and not wait until I’m obese and it’s too late. Whenever we are out for meals, he’d ask me to stop when he thinks I have eaten enough - without even asking me if I am full or done with my food. Though his comments have been on and off, he has been telling me to lay off some weight quite frequently in the past few months. It’s to the point where I starve myself on days I see him just so I can look and feel skinnier. He’s a great guy in general but can’t help but feel that he doesn’t respect my feelings. What should I do? He knows I’m hurt by his comments but continues saying them anyway and never once apologised even when I teared-#100058: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100058","['Like: 28 people', 'Angry: 21 people', 'Sad: 11 people']",78 comments,6 shares
100049,"Reply to https://www.NUSWhispers.com/#!tag/99991I think it’s me even though hopefully not me. I have a work colleague which confessed to me that she liked me at one point. However her feelings are rebutted due to me being already married happily. I told her that I cannot accept her feelings hence being friends would be the best course of actions for both of us. We have a mutual colleague which one day finally collected her dream bto home and we went up together, 3 of us, me included. We were chatting on social media and started following each other (I told her we did not follow each other before, but now we did, so I did not lie, I just did not tell you we followed each other). We used to chat everyday by texting etc, now we cut less, no longer everyday, perhaps less than 10 texts over a span of 3 days etc. Getting lesser and lesser (it only has been 2 weeks since I agreed with my wife I will speak to her less), of which, we still need to communicate over work. Just the conversation are always for work or just chit chat, no personal information or emotional chats were involved. I don’t get it, from my perspective, I will never cheat on my wife, however I don’t have many friends, none of my own friends, only mutual friends that know me and my wife. Whereas my wife has her own group of friends whom i dont know about. I suddenly met this female colleague and suddenly became friends with her, but my wife kept suspecting that I am cheating on her and breaking her trust. Perhaps it’s better I don’t have any female friends, regardless close or not.-#100049: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100049","['Like: 19 people', 'Haha: 8 people', 'Sad: 3 people']",23 comments,7 shares
100037,"I’m in my mid-20 (F) trying to find my next bf on dating apps…sometimes for casual fun. On these apps I came across guys (mostly those who are dtf) who were up for the casual fun portion, and said that they are single but do not want rs. Since I was looking for casual fun when talking to these guys, I didn’t care much when they said they didn’t want to get into rs.After a while of being fwbs/having casual hangouts, I found out (without them knowing that I did) that they were married, some even with kids, and having great rs with their wives. Of course, I broke things off with them once I found out but such high number of people cheating on dating apps makes me doubt the trust between couples…I’m sure there are wives who cheat too so this is not limited to only guys. I’m not very experienced in the dating field and I’m not sure if this is the ugly side of romance/adult world. Just want to hear from everyone (especially married couples): Do you get married with full trust in your partner that he/she won’t cheat? Or do you get married knowing that one of you may cheat but choose to ignore and not think about it? Etc.

100025,"This is my reply to #99910, where the girl asked if she can trust the bf when he had sex with 16 girls in the past 5-6 years.It really depends on how he treated these 16 girls. Did he try to make all of them feel special, only to dump them later? If true, you're probably the next.Did he really great them strictly as ONS/FWB and no feelings are involved? Then it's possible you can trust him. However do note that that's a sign of someone with a heart of stone.Compared to him, I have more than double the number of girls I have had sex with in the past 7 years and I have never cheated. (I had 1 relationship in the 3rd year) The reason I started to actively look for sex was due to my low self esteem deep down. I wasn't really attractive and I was awkward when I was young so I missed out on all the boy-girl relationships my friends had in school. So when I hit 19 I hit the gym, got some fashion sense, and learned how to talk and flirt with girls. My ""success"" rate wasn't high, but I was meeting new girls every week from the clubs and apps. I'd say I pulled an average of 1 girl every other month.Eventually I realised that sex isn't what I wanted. I always wanted to stay to cuddle even with my ONS and FWBS and I felt mini heartbreaks every time a girl stopped contacting me. This continued on and on till I cant even bring myself to meet new girls anymore.I am now happily attached to a wonderful girl whom I will never cheat on, and I have told her about my history and she seems fine with it.

100018,"I went to a neighborhood secondary school and HCJC. I dropped out after a year because I disapproved of the grade-obsession. It was a terrible environment in which to learn. I may have been too stupid to do well at Hwa Chong, but a better excuse is I came from a high SES do-whatever-you-want family so there was very little emphasis on grades. I entered community college in the US. The American education system turned out to be a good match for my style of learning and I transferred after 2 years to Penn. My Penn GPA was 3.92 in two majors, math and economics. I then did my masters at MIT.When I tried to find a job in Singapore after graduation, it was odd to me that several employers (especially government-related) wanted me to explain my JC situation and why I never did A-levels. Why does it matter? I have accredited degrees with transcripts. Surely university records supersede anything anterior. Would they want to see my botched PSLE as well? I have a sub 200 PSLE. Before deciding to come home, I had several offers for jobs at companies like Palantir and Two Sigma who didn’t care that I went to a community college. I came home because my dad had a stroke and I am his only son.I did eventually find a job, and it wasn’t a particularly difficult process with my dad’s connections.

I am currently earning about 1.5x more than her so she expects me to contribute more. She cited the following reasons:1. I earn significantly more than her2. She just paid off her study loan3. She has to support her mum because she is in poor health and can no longer work but barely has enough for retirement.We are getting married end of this year and our flat will be ready sometime next year. My grandma is getting older and really hopes to see her great grandchild before she passes away. My fiancee on the other hand is hesitant about having a child so soon because she thinks that she will struggle financially if she has to support both her mum and a child. She would feel more secure having more financial support from me, in the event that her career gets affected due to the pregnancy.I think i understand her situation but i cannot help but feel a little unfair that as a man i am expected to pay more.

99994,"Hi Prof Ben, how do I stop and resolve this feeing of emptiness on the inside?I have graduated in 2019 and am in a job in the finance industry now. Life’s great after I switched out of another field I hated in 2020 - I got into a big company, got a pretty high salary boost, and the job isn’t bad. I don’t like it, but I don’t hate it either.But recently especially these past few weeks, I have been feeling like life is so meaningless. I told my partner about this but their response scared me; they were genuinely concerned but they were concerned that I wasn’t going to be “stable” enough for our future dreams: yknow, BTO, a kid, a stable family and the like. It felt like I couldn’t share any of these feelings with my partner anymore. But deep inside my heart, I kinda feel like this isn’t what I want. This whole career in a job I feel neutral about, and these future pursuits of career progression in the same industry. And all these talk about a flat with my partner and a kid too. I have been feeling as if life is meaningless - this feeling comes and goes and I’ve been trying to hide it because there’s nothing to complain about in my current life now, but I can’t ignore this emptiness gnawing at me from the inside.I don’t know what is the real cause of it - is it because I’m not doing something I’m passionate about? But the truth is, it’s too risky to quit now, and I don’t truly know what I want to pursue either (no concrete plans). Or am I just feeling a burnout at work?Will these feelings go away on their own? What should I do?-#99994: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99994","['Like: 27 people', 'Care: 8 people', 'Sad: 5 people']",15 comments,7 shares

99985,"I (29yo Male) am the only child of my family. My career path was full of ups and downs, therefore in terms of financials, I am just an average joe. My family are not well educated and they have zero financial literacy as well as future/retirement planning. Truth be told, my parents have less than $15,000 combined savings. My dad works as a lorry driver in a company owned by his friend(Boss). His friend takes good care of my dad and even gave him a higher salary with lesser workload compared to other lorry drivers. Other benefits like leaves and MC are also much more than other employees. But recently, my dad’s friend(Boss) requires my dad to drive an older model lorry instead of the current one, due to some reshuffling of staffs and lorries. My dad is not very pleased and wants to change job because the lorry is much harder to manoeuvre for his daily job scope. He says he just want a relaxing job and doesn’t mind getting a salary as low as $1,800. I explained to him why he should stick to his current job which pays much more and the money earned can be put to good use in his later stage of his life. He got angry at me, saying I am not a filial son, wanting him to go through hardships. My mum on the other hand is also another problem because she is always in and out of odd jobs because she is very picky and does not get along with her colleagues wherever she work at. Lets cut to the chase, my point here is that in the future, I foresee my family to down-spiral and suffer due to their current choices in life that they make. I mean, how are we going to afford for anything in the future in terms of unforeseen unfortunate situations. Lets face it, my parents do not even have enough money to even hold a funeral if my grandparents were to pass on in the future(just being very realistic about life here, I am not cursing my own grandparents)I need to also plan for my own future, housing, marriage, and everything that comes together with them. If I were to drain all my savings to help my family for the above mentioned situations, how am I going to move forward in life to start my own family? Who is going to help me? Is my existence purely to pay the price of the wrong decisions my family made?I am deeply stressed and depressed about this. I am in a dilemma, should I forsake them and focus on my life or stay with them and let them drag me down and destroy my future?-#99985: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99985","['Like: 39 people', 'Care: 20 people', 'Sad: 15 people']",46 comments,17 shares
99984,"Hi guys, need some advice here. So, my dad has been increasingly difficult to get along with and it's very stressful.He often leaves the house randomly for a few hours without informing any family members where or why is he going out even when we are home. There are always times when we could just be in the toilet or room in a short while and lol he disappeared. Not that we should call him every time and ask him because it would be controlling his freedom or sth. We are also not going to stop or stalk him but isn't it proper to at least notify anyone that he is going out? We have told him multiple times but nothing changed. Also, he has very frequent mood swings where he would raise past issues and conflict with my brother and mum, especially so as they are all WFH except myself. Most often, the issues are just very minor or irrelevant but he will continue to grumble, curse all the bad words and link to other things. Then, more ""war"" erupted between the parties. I am emotionally very worn out and drained having to placate him, having to be the mitigator for both sides and to ask my brother and mum to avoid unnecessary conversations with him. However, it's useless. These days, any conversation topics can become a trigger for my dad to start his unpleasant grumbles and transform into an unreasonable person. I am burnt out from handling all these drama and I am trying to be more patient and understanding to listen and solve his unhappiness but I am really very drained. There seems to be no end to this. I can't imagine myself taking on the role of a caregiver in the future. To those who may have experienced similar situations before, can I seek your advice on ways to improve this situation or is this probably just a temporary men memopausal period (he's in his sixties) which will pass on with time?Really thankful and grateful for your advices!-#99984: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99984","['Like: 8 people', 'Sad: 2 people']",12 comments,1 share
99980,"TLDR; Fiance is violent and abusive. Wedding paid for. Don't really want to leave but don't know if it is possible to stay. So I am 26F and my fiance is 29M. We got engaged last year and plan to move in together after the wedding in a month. However, I find that my fiance's anger issues and violent tendencies have been acting up. He has always had violent outbursts once or twice a year and I have stayed on hoping that he will change. He blames his anger on me (how I argue in the heat of the moment etc) but agrees that his violent reactions are wrong. We are now engaged, paid for wedding expenses and everyone knows. I have been scarred by his past violent episodes and I find that I do love him, but I am not at all in love with him. There is no intimacy and I actually am scared of the way he will react so I often argue over text as I can't say what I want to say to his face. I can't tell this to my family because they will automatically ask me to leave him. It will break their heart as they do not know this side of his. His family normalises violence and abuse in a marriage so there is no point turning there. I still hope that he will change and I find it very hard to give up on things without a proper shot from us both. Lately he is being controlling and when I push back he says I have changed so much. It is almost as if he cannot handle me being independent and assertive and calling out his bad behaviour. I can feel myself start to drift.I don't know what to do. It is not easy to just cancel a marriage and call things off. Has anyone been in such a situation and have had things work out before? Will he change and stop being violent with therapy? I am terrified. I really want the situation to get better but I also know I will be able to move on with the marriage and put on a front. I know the logical thing to do is leave but put yourself in my situation and please advise. Leaving him is way easier said than done.

99957,"Hi NUSWhispers, a fellow Nusalumni who follow the page actively.I apologise for a lengthy story.With the recent issues sparkling debate in parliament as well as in the local news papers bought my attention to share/seek advice from NUSWhispers.I am the first graduate in my entire family to study in NUS from India. After financially struggling in secondary school and bachelors managed to be in the top creamy layer. ( I also understood while studying, it’s hard for locals to get into NUS/NTU, i am sorry we didn’t know that before if I look into your prospective, I have taken a local opportunity ) With a lot of aspiring dreams applied to Nus to do masters, to my luck I got admitted and took a loan in India as well as here in local bank, signed a bond with MOE to work in Singapore. I must thank Singapore and all my fellow friends across all nationalities made me comfortable with lectures, group discussions , projects and so on.  With a hefty loan on my back($4XXXX), I continued to study hard, worked as a intern to meet my day to day needs.After graduation in 20XX, I managed to secure a job in a MNC and started working (NON - IT). Started with my basic EP salary($3X). Those time the dependent pass salary was some $4XXX, and along the way government has raised the dependent pass salaries to $6XXX. I am happy with the team, and continued to work along with them for X years, and still I don’t want to leave the team as we became good friends along the way. In those years, I have cleared my bank loan in Singapore, india bank loan, and served the bond, while closing the bond i thanked MOE for this opportunity, without them I’ll not be here, and still happy to continue working.Since I am reaching age 3X, parents started to question for a marriage and a match was found. Happily I announced it to my manager, and asked him, I need support on dependent pass ( my salary is $4X) he said sorry we can’t raise so much to meet your needs. That’s where my depression started to kick in as the match rejected saying I can’t afford to live together.When i shared my story to my fellow colleagues(locals), they are in a state of shock as they thought my salary is high,  but In reality I am in the same boat as them. If I ask more pay to support my dependent pass I feel sad for my co-workers who put the same effort and it hurts to ask for a raise for myself.In the recent days, I observed the news well, and even myself I realised to see many Indians who bring their entire family to Singapore along with their elderly parents. Anonymously I checked their profile in social media, found to be they work in X and X company with a basic bachelors degree from some random university, offered a pay more than a NUS graduate. And they can afford to rent a condo, make their child study in a private school and applying PR here.( I have seen the recent surge from 2018)In this I have the same doubt as people ask,- how did the company hire them directly into SG?- what is the experience/ qualifications we need to attain that level of pay?- Almost everyone can afford  to have a maid - for them DP is approved instantly, and can rent a condo ( I stay with my friend in a shared room in HDB)This confession is not only from my side, is from most of the fellow graduates who passed out of NUS and NTU ( including PH.D degree holders) are also among them.- most of them stay in hdb in sharing a room.- We repay all the loans - Serve the bond and be loyal to the opportunity offered to us- Companies cannot sponsor for dependent pass.With all the info I shared, we need the same answers as the local people ask, how did people from the country can directly come here without any struggle.-#99957: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99957","['Like: 33 people', 'Care: 13 people', 'Wow: 4 people']",18 comments,8 shares

Gor Gor sees this young grad speaking so confidently, carrying himself so we'll around managers. Gor Gor is very relieved to see people like him enter the workforce. Fired up with passion, enthusiastic and eager. Very good. Good for him la, Gor Gor nothing to learn him also, at most tell him what to gope from pantry. To all fresh grads, remember, treat your probation as training. Ask when don't know. Connect with colleagues. Take notes. Have something to look forward to at the end of the day and week. Maybe a cup of bubble tea once a week, or go out and gai gai with friends and family. Gor Gor learnt at a very late stage that having something to look forward to is very important. Find something you like to do. Do it at the end of the day or week. Gor Gor cannot promise much, but can promise this, your working life will be much better with that little thing you look forward to each week.I quote Twice: Cheer up baby cheer up baby.

99919,"Im sorry for the long story. I just broke up with my bf today. He is the most perfect bf I've ever had. He dotes on me, and takes care of me when I'm sick and injured. He expresses his love alot through actions and not just talk, he often initiate to do things for me without me even asking. He's always thinking of me and prioritising me. His family is also extra nice to me. He even accepts that I'm ill and can't have children. Sometimes I really think I don't deserve him...and I don't think I'll ever meet someone who loves me as much as he does. I love him very much and enjoys being with him. But he broke his promise of not gambling anymore. He had a gambling addiction before we met. He used to earn 6k+ a month but has zero savings because he spends it all on gambling the moment he gets paid. His only redeeming point is he doesn't borrow money or use other people's money. I set up a ""quit gambling plan"" for him and when he asked me out he promised he'll never gamble again. The first time he broke the promise, I forgave him because he confessed on his own without me finding out and regretted. And that time we agreed, if it happens again, we will break up. Everything went well for quite some time... That I actually forgot about it... Until recently I found out that he secretly withdrawn money from his savings bank account and gambled again. He lost 10k in less than 2 weeks. Today he packed all his stuffs and left. He cried and apologised to me. He's the kind that doesn't shed a single tear even while watching the saddest show. He says he understands he did wrong and didn't deserve me, that he's sorry for doing this to me and that he loves me alot. He didn't even try to make any excuse for himself. Even though we're breaking up he still promised again that he won't touch gambling again. It breaks my heart to see him cry like that. Am I too cruel? For ending this for that one thing that he did wrong, when he did the other 99 things right. But I've seen too many people who ruined their lives and their family's lives with gambling and I feel like he'll never learn his lessons if I forgive him again... I don't want to talk to my friends about it as they know him....my family likes him alot too and I have not told them yet.

One thing bad about this is that we can't see how busy each other is and this is where I'm frustrated about. Whenever I need my boss for questions or approval of some documents she is always not around and even when the other managers start to call us for stuff she is always missing from those calls and I have to be the one answering on her behalf and due to this I'm also the one getting questioned by the other managers when there is an error on the work that we produce. The other colleagues will not answer and I am always the one getting arrowed as I've been working for the longest among my colleagues but its only for 2 years while the others are 1 year or lesser. I've not asked why is she not around as most of the time she would say that she has personal matter to attend to or she is doing a project so was not able to reply. But if you are doing a project your teams status should not be away most of the time and when the managers call you should be able to answer them on time? If it is really personal matters I would understand if you gave us a heads up and not leaving us to panic whenever they call for any issues.I'm sick and tired of this cycle of being a parot to pass the message from the managers to her and take down notes for her when I receive any ""feedbacks"" from the managers.

99914,"Reply to #99624BreakupHave you ever wonder how he's doing or what he's going through after the breakup? When he first started a relationship with you, he's in a situation that he has never encountered before. Sure he had no intention of changing his mind back then, but throughout the relationship his love for you has outgrown everything else. Have you given him a chance after the breakup just to express how he can't live without you, and will rather choose to lose everything than to lose you? It may have started as a no strings attached relationship, but hanging on together for so long means something to both. It's not just you who can't take it, he can't take it either, but he couldn't physically express it out. He finally found the love of his life, you, but he's afraid that he will lose you as well after choosing to lose everything in his life.It's a gamble, but you'll have to let him know if you still love him deeply. If you really have gotten past him after the break up, especially after a long period of break up, your heart wouldn't be tearing right now. How can you be so sure that he's not torn and broken just like you, that he's barely hanging on, severely depressed, because he has lost the love of his life? How can you assume that he moved on after experiencing the deep love and connection that both shared? All that's left are the images of you in his mind, the memories both shared, the secrets both holds on to each other, between 2 complete strangers. He finally understands what he can't live without, but to him, it's all too late. He will have to live in regret for the rest of his life, losing his soul mate.-#99914: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99914","['Like: 13 people', 'Sad: 5 people', 'Care: 1 person']",4 comments,4 shares

We been together for months, and I have always given him the time he needed, and he still thinks that’s not enough. He said I prioritise everything over him, my family, friends and career even though I am meeting him every other day. I feel that he is not giving me the sense of security that I want and I feel stress telling him that I am meeting my friends, as he will always asked me not to go out too late. There was once I am late, he got angry and expects me for an apology.So WhatsApp have this double tick seen function, whenever I was busy, I didn’t even read this text, so he said that I didn’t treat him as important cause I don’t bother to read, then when I am free, I will reply everything, However to him, he chose to read without replying and even forgotten about it.

I feel like we will always wonder what it would have been like if we had gotten together. with my husband now, increasingly our differences are causing distance and friction. we've talked things out and we are seeing how it goes. but sometimes I feel like it's harder and harder to imagine a future with him. we've moved out to stay on our own since marriage but I always feel like I have to pick up after him and remind him to do his share in managing the household.

99902,"Hi guys, some advise is needed. I’m a male and have a female friend that is super friendly. She is the kind that is always cheerful and full of energy. She is petite in size and has a good figure and good looks. She is the kind that can be considered as ‘touchy’ and always has guys going after her. Many guys have confessed to her (more then 10 from what I know) and she has politely rejected but she always does not seem to mind holding hands or hugging guys. So the question is for this kind of girl, how do you know if she has actual interest in a guy? Many of her actions may be considered as ‘signs’ but she does this to most. Besides asking her directly which many guys have done, and have interpreted it wrongly, is there other signs or ways for a girl of this personality?

99898,"I'm taking a computing class, and we're using this really old library (literally from early 2000s and no one is using it anymore, online documentation is on those old black and white HTML websites, most StackOverflow questions are from over 10 years ago). In one of our lecture, we asked about it and the prof said yes its a very old framework, and basically no one in industry is using it anymore, but don't worry because it is sufficient for learning the materials in this module.I understand that most modules are about the underlying principles so old frameworks are sufficient, but sufficient doesn't necessarily mean ideal right? So, I'm wondering why we don't use more ""popular"" languages and frameworks to achieve the same learning purposes, since students can still learn the same principles, but with more ""trending"" tools that we could apply outside of school. I believe students will be more interested and they are usually easier to learn (more information online) so profs will also have an easier time teaching them.-#99898: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99898","['Like: 4 people', 'Sad: 1 person']",0 Comments,3 comments

Discrepancies were discovered on Friday but I was pretty confident that i didn't make any careless mistakes. My boss and colleague are super nice about it and they think we should just retry it again. On one hand, I'm very thankful that I didn't get reprimanded since I was pretty confident that i didn't get anything wrong because I ticked off things I've already done so I don't miss anything out. On the other hand, this isn't the first time I made a careless mistake so I'm doubting myself as well.The harder I try to not make mistakes, the more nervous I get and start breaking and knocking stuff over. But if I don't pay closer attention, I unknowingly make other mistakes.I'm so tired of this vicious cycle. I feel terrible for my colleague and boss and genuinely wish I can do better but all I'm feeling is like a burden to the department. The previous intern was very close to the boss and colleague and while I and them aren't strangers, I feel pressured to perform up to her standards but it's disappointing when I can neither measure up in terms of performance and comfort with them. I want so badly to freely talk to them but the guilt of doing my work badly holds me back from treating my colleague as a friend and there's some awkwardness when things settle down. The uncomfortable feeling of being in an unfamiliar area, the fact that I'm making lots of mistakes, and my overall awkwardness is just adding on to the stress. Leading to even more mistakes. Not making excuses because I know I'm careless but I'm trying to rectify that.

We are very uncomfortable and upset with this situation. This staff is not someone special who is magically immune to covid at all. If any of us gets infected or is potentially already infected, he is acting as a catalyst for a super spreader to all of the other classes. What is the point of getting our teachers to take photos of us and restrict our seating arrangements so strictly if we still have this man going around defying any logical sense of safe management measures? Just because he holds a big position here, it does not make him immune to the virus or from becoming a spreader.NUS, we are doing our part here and listening to your measures. Our uni experience is already being reduced, so please control your staff as well and teach them safe management measures. Do not ruin this further for us. Based on luminus, this module has 3200 students. Putting us in smaller classes becomes meaningless if we have this guy running around like a headless chicken. If anything, action should be taken against him for what he is doing during these troubled times. Please think through carefully whether what he is doing is the right thing to do.

Things started to take a turn a few years ago when he suddenly got addicted to gambling. He was very heavily in debt and I have to step in to help clear it up. It totaled to about 40-50k and cost me my whole savings. It was an on-off addiction so during like the 3/4th time when he went back to gambling, he wanted to break off with me because he felt that he was pulling me down. But I really couldn’t let him go because I know that If I were to leave him then he’s really all alone and I just couldn’t bear to do that. He worked really hard to quit off his addiction for me, and was finally about to cut it off completely this year. I know that during all these times, he was super stressed up with money issues so I told him, don’t worry about it, I’ll take care of it so he can just earn as much as he can while on his delivery job. The problem is that he currently has a lot on his plate, so much so that his monthly income couldn’t cover his expenses. He has to pay for his house bills, his work bike and his other sport bike for leisure. So as and when he doesn’t have enough, I’ll lend him the shortage and he’ll return me the following month when he has enough. The problem is I only take home about 2k per month and after I deduct like monthly expenses and allowance for my parents, I really don’t have much left. His COE for the sports bike is due next year and I told him that maybe we should renew the COE and sell off that bike because we really couldn’t afford it. But he said that riding is his passion and the only thing that is making him happy and he doesn’t wanna give it up. The problem is we don’t even have enough for the COE renewal and needs to loan from the bank, which is gonna add on to our monthly expenses. When I bring up about the money issue, he mentioned that I’m no longer supporting him as I used to before. I told him that i still am but we got to start thinking of the future and can’t be like this forever. He said that I’m stressing him and if I ever bring this up again he’ll break up with me. Am I doing it all wrong?Honestly, even as I’m writing this, I’m on the verge of crying because I just don’t know what to do. I can’t talk to anyone about this, not even my friends or family..

I’m honestly not sure how to feel about that and did not pry too much into the details as im afraid of what i might hear. While i do have an interest in entering a relationship with him in the future, the idea of him sleeping around with multiple girls in the past seems rather disturbing, and some of the girls happened to be in the same course as me too. My friends however, told me that its almost impossible to find someone who has never hooked up before at our age range, and i should learn to be more open towards this. Do people and guys in particular, really not get emotionally attached after engaging in such an intimate act with others? Can the mind really detach itself from the body when one is hooking up?

Other than that, it seems like they normally play games in the afternoon then have a talking session in the evening, in which the uncle just listens. (Provides a supposedly listening ear and probably not simping or smth)He is single, and always buys the other 3 girls gifts. For example, flowers on Valentines, and a cat lamp on Christmas. FYI, they used to work in the same company and became friends eventually.

99812,"Ladies, i need advice on what to do when you really hate a certain group of people that your partner hangs out with.For context, i came to know from a mutual friend that these 2 friends of my boyfriend's have been bitching about me . My boyfriend is aware of it as well. These 2 guys are obnoxious sexists who diss their girlfriends, their friends' girlfriends and generally almost the entire female population, and even claimed that females only exist for the purpose of reproduction. I also found out that when my boyfriend meets up with them, they bombard him with bad points about me (some are true and some are made up stories) as if they are trying to destroy our relationship. I'm sure i have not offended them in any way, maybe just a little hostile towards them due to their narcissistic characters. While i do not wish to be the petty girlfriend who controls who my boyfriend chats/hang out with, i find myself getting bothered that he actually chose to engage with that kind of friends. Y'know when you rant to a genuine friend they will empathize and offer solutions, but this kind of friends just add oil to fire and sprout some nonsense they do not have to take responsibility for. I openly told my boyfriend that i do not like that those friends are not respecting me and our relationship, but he kind of brushes it off. I know that i can stand up for myself by confronting the friend but at this point i do not want to do it without his knowledge first.We have plans to BTO soon but I'm not sure if this issue will become a big problem in the future. I'm not so confident that my boyfriend will continue to love me the same if he constantly hears negative false rumours about me.

99807,"I abstained from the conversation about YNC's closure but as a member of the first-ever graduating class of the college I just want to remind us all that while the emotional impact of the closure of our school is akin to that of losing a loved one, not all of us are emotionally affected by the decision to the same degree. I'm sure most YNC graduates are like me, i.e we know that our lives are probably not going to be impacted much as our diplomas still bear the name of NUS. The accusations that YNC trains their students to be whiny about small things isn't true in the slightest, Singapore does.To all my fellow YNC alumni, let's not try to whitewash the fact that part of the reason we chose (or our parents chose) to attend YNC is because of the name, ""Yale."" I don't know many people who would have chosen to attend YNC had it been named Singapore University of Liberal Arts a la SUSS. It doesn't help to keep on overcompensating. If we really were that good, many of us would've taken the need-blind route to the Ivies.Let's just move on shall we. The incessant SJW behavior on these comments trying to justify your outrage isn't doing YNC any favours. Yes, the college is gone and there's some nostalgia. But don't pretend that we are annoyed for what this means for Singapore society at large. Every year hundreds of Singaporeans come back with Ivy League degrees. Even if we assumed that YNC students are of the same vintage as Ivy League graduates, Singapore will not be much different with 250 less of such ""talent"" each year.

At first I didnt know he was married but I found out and he started to tell me the sob story about how his then-gf forced him to marry her by lying to him about being on pills. She got pregnant and said if he doesnt marry her, she will commit suicide. But he was not happy being with her and finds her to be super controlling and psycho. I was dumb then and of course, felt sorry for him. So we dated and eventually his wife found out.The only truth that he said to me was that his wife is indeed a psycho. She threatened me and forced me to apologize to her. At that time, she was pregnant with their second child so I also didnt want to agitate her, so I gave in and apologize to her. However, her husband got away with having an affair and I even heard they have a third kid soon after.Now that I am older, I wonder why did she blame me like it was my fault when it was HER husband who did her wrong. I also heard I was not the only ""affair"" her husband had. He even slept with her own friends and she didnt even find out.

If its actually for instance Lee Wei Lin Liberal Arts College, how many people would actually gloss over it and how many people would attend?If you would still attend, then what is the loss? Your degree has been and is still backed by NUS. The curriculum according to NUS would be similar though changed slightly, and its common that curriculum changes as we have seen over the years.If its about the loss of the name ""Yale"", then its a matter of your pursuit of prestige failing. Perhaps NUS should not have over-sold / falsely advertise this programme by using the ""Yale"" name, and this whole saga might have been prevented if its called a different one from the start.

Maybe you've got CCA. Maybe you've got hall activities. Maybe you're not prioritizing the project because you don't give a shit. Hey, I get it, if you own it and you're self-aware, more power to you. I'm glad you have that personal growth. But maybe you can communicate it to your group members your current position ​so that we know what to expect from your non/marginal/full contribution, if any. If you have not noticed, this is not Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters or Miss Robichaux's Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies - I cannot read your mind and I cannot divine your thoughts. Again, there's nothing wrong if you tell me ""Hey, I'm not invested because of XYZ."" I'd respect you more that way for having honesty. I don't remember signing up to be a part of a trashy TV series where I know what the character is supposed to do but still get frustrated when they don't do it. If I did sign up for a TV series, I would rather be in Xavier's School or Miss Robichaux's Academy. Sadly, there are very few people who are capable of doing that, and I am stuck in reruns of trashy TV series. I mean, if all of us can have great communication, maybe we'd be the utopia some of us have imagined society to be. I am not discounting those who have serious legit issues like mental health, personal issues or physical health issues. I understand that it can be troubling especially when emotions are at play. I take offense however, when people are gallivanting and then at the last minute, try to piece together a project. Or people put on blinders to focus on another module and then magically want to contribute at the last minute. The world does not stop. Manage your priorities and responsibilities. It does not surprise me to hear that sometimes, fresh graduates struggle when entering the work force. Some of the work ethics I see are neither grand prize worthy nor will they snatch any ballroom trophies. I can tell you for a fact that you can get fired for procrastinating. And yeah, maybe when you work, you are paid. So is that it? Money is your motivation? Or climbing the corporate ladder? Is that how you suddenly skyrocket and have that preppy zeal in your work? You're gallivanting now because you're on mummy and daddy's credit card? Or maybe you're complacent because you're on that scholarship and know that your future is secured and that maybe you just need to scrape through? Sink yourself all you want, I respect that decision. But don't bring any of us down. It really boggles me that some people can get amazing grades and have poor work ethics. Is it because you have your seniors or friends copy? Paraphrase the whole lot and submit it for that First Class Honours / Highest Distinction / A+ all in an hour or two? I would love to see how that strategy pans out in the workforce, when you are thrust into the company of strangers. Maybe that's why fresh graduates struggle. They procrastinated the growth they were supposed to have in university to the point that they flounder at their first few months. May the powers that be grant you your fate accordingly.Now, I wish I have a new remote.

In the past, we would never fight, and he would always treat me so well that I actually believed that he was the best guy who could never possibly exist. He never got mad at me and he would always be helpful, caring and understanding towards me, even in the extreme cases. I was always his top priority.

99763,"On the YNC merger:As a recent FASS graduate, I think it was unnecessary. Merging the Arts and Science faculties into a combined college, while forced, still had some merit for forcing science and arts majors to take a little bit of mods from the other side, and even my FASS seniors who work in Econs roles now welcome the move cos some of them are working in biomedical policy for the government and now are needing to self-study bio for example, to apply their Econs or GL knowledge to. But YNC already has such an interdisciplinary program for the first 2 years (which is why I avoided that place) and so I don’t see what merit comes from merging the two except for saving money and reducing admin costs. The USP was a residential program with extra modules to help people learn things outside their major but without forcing a full liberal arts platter on them, and had its own set of international double degrees (with Sciences Po, Waseda etc).These were 2 different programs that catered to people who wanted different levels of variety in their learning. FASS/FOS is at one extreme with deep focus on only one type of subject, USP is that + a bit more, and YNC is for those who wanted to dip into everything. So the mergers are reducing choice. I guess it all converges to wanting to produce graduates with more diverse skills, but that doesn’t mean the school has to handhold and force-feed diversity to every student (I believe that there will be more remnants of YNC than USP in the final product). As someone with no emotional investment in either program, I am now after 4 years in FASS, a big believer of interdisciplinary learning. But I don’t necessarily want to take exams for every kind of subject. Coming from FASS I never formally took any math or science after JC, but I self-studied calculus and biochemistry without exam pressure. I think students should be afforded this freedom than to have to do it because of rules.Ultimately the biggest skill one should take away from uni is the ability to learn things fast and without much handholding from a teacher. I think that outside of professional degrees, we just deserve to have a good 4 years honing that skill of self-directed learning in whatever content domain we like, and if you have more eclectic tastes, YNC and USP should exist side by side with the traditional faculties to offer the widest choice. If a FASS major really needed chemistry they can learn it when they need. And if a physicist needs to know Econs for managing research budgets they can learn it then. I would rather see NUS do more to offer continuing education credits than merge faculties.-#99763: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99763","['Like: 33 people', 'Love: 3 people']",2 comments,5 shares

99753,"YNC – USP MergerAs someone who studied the humanities in junior college, considers herself a liberal (inb4 “not all YNC students…”) and almost applied to YNC herself, I would have expected to feel more sympathetic to the closure of YNC.  However, the reaction of many YNC students and alumni were frankly off-putting and reinforced some of my impressions of YNC elitism from my time at NUS.  I wish to talk about why this is so, as well as why I support the merger and the formation of New College.As a preliminary note, let’s call the closure a closure.  YNC will effectively cease to exist.  YNC has always been an autonomous college from NUS with its own identity.  People applied to YNC, not to NUS.  In contrast, USP has always been a programme within NUS (although it too has its own identity).  I believe YNC’s autonomous nature and separate identity is a big reason why YNC students have been more vocal and probably feel the pain of closure more acutely than USP students, who have been comparatively stoic in their response.I also wish to acknowledge the pain and sadness that many YNC students and alumni are feeling at losing the community they have built and found self-actualisation in.  Many YNC students and alumni have written movingly on this, and no fair-minded person who has read these accounts can deny these lived experiences.My disagreement is that in their sadness, many Kingfishers have argued against closure in an elitist manner and left out important considerations of financial prudence.  On elitism: -(a) Touting YNC exceptionalism, while slighting/ignoring the work of FASS / NUS.  Prof Daniel Goh has a post on this which I wish to refer you to https://www.facebook.com/daniel.ps.goh/posts/10158382881196430.  While the YNC alumni has subsequently clarified that this was not meant to diss FASS / NUS, I believe that the excerpt cited by Prof Goh speaks for itself in what the author truly meant when he wrote what he wrote (cf. his post hoc justification after being called out).  While the author’s focus was on the loss of YNC and his own experiences at YNC, and I do not believe that he intended to diss FASS/NUS, the fact that the excerpt in question was written is example A of the casual exceptionalism and the subconscious (or otherwise) “better than thou” attitude of some Kingfishers.  Ironically, it would appear that some of the responses by YNC students and alumni have alienated some of the people who would be most sympathetic to their cause.(b) Prejudging the New College.  Some off-putting justifications I’ve read include arguments along the line that the small close-knit community at YNC cannot be replicated at scale by New College.  Or that some other character of the YNC community that made YNC successful will be lost at New College (and indeed it will!).  These arguments tend to be interspersed with moving anecdotal accounts of YNC community life.  They also sometimes come with sweeping statements catastophising what the closure of YNC means for education / critical education / the liberal arts in Singapore.  (Please, the idea of a liberal arts has been done by USP long before YNC came along).(c) These arguments seem to assume that YNC is the gold standard for a “liberal arts” education.  If you start from the premise that YNC is the gold standard, then New College will always fall short in some respect, because New College is emphatically not YNC and does not aspire to be.  I have also not seen many recognition on the Kingfishers’ part that New College will be a merger of USP and YNC, with the exception of this thoughtful piece in the Octant: https://theoctant.org/.../from-curd-to-butter-to-ghee-on.../ (d) On the point of dissing NUS and elitism, there was even a piece in the Octant that was later password locked and then (I think) taken down in which the author disses the New College students by saying, “…we won’t be able to barricade ourselves against the incoming cohort of ‘New College’ students and the NUS overreach they bring with them.” (Read: YNC bourgeoisie barricading themselves in their palatial campus against the hoi polloi NUS hoarde)On the issue of financial prudence, it’s been an open secret that YNC survives on MOE funding and the cost per student is prohibitively expensive.  Good things don’t come cheap – the nice campus, low class sizes and a 4-year (subsidised) residence don’t come cheap.  And yes - it is subsidised (even for those not on FA) - because the tuition fees don’t even come close to covering the cost per student.  Please see this twitter thread by a YNC professor, which makes the case that YNC has failed to hit its financial goals by probably a wide margin: https://mobile.twitter.com/.../status/1431832560213102592... In short, while many a Kingfishers may have found self-actualisation and meaning and more in the YNC community, the community is propped up with taxpayers money and the Government has a duty to spend taxpayers money wisely.  I think a big consideration would be the number of students benefiting from the monies.  Should Singapore continue to spend large sums of money for a select few in YNC, or can the same amount be utilised to bring more students to the liberal arts and the humanities at the New College?  Even if the education at New College is a watered down version of a “Yale” liberal arts education (Also Kingfishers – that’s not a very post-colonial argument of you eh ????), if it benefit more students, I think that would be money well spent.  Ironically, the elitist and cocooned responses to the closure of YNC only reinforces in my mind the argument that the monies would be better spent on New College, rather than on a selected few.In short, I feel bad for the YNC students and alumni, who have lost their community (in a sense, because of course it lives on in them).  But the practical and financial consideration necessitates your loss.  Let’s use the resources to benefit more students, in a responsible manner.  P.S. I make no comments on the way the announcement was made, which seems to be to be a slightly separate topic for a separate post.-#99753: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99753",['Like: 84 people'],8 comments,26 shares
99752,"Guys... Does this count as gaslighting?Sometimes when I'm eating with my girlfriend, i find that she tends to try really hard to convince me that a certain taste which she prefers is better and therefore more superior. For example, I personally prefer spicier food but when we discuss about whatever we are eating, she proceeds to dish out a few reasons why i shouldn't think that way. I get that everyone has different tastebuds but i really wished she would stop shooting down my opinions.Another thing is, sometimes she says that i am too narrow minded when i do not think or do what she wants me to do. If I'm ranting about a colleague, instead of empathizing with me, she just says things like 'aiya it's just in your head lah' BUT when she's the one bitching about her friends it's totally fine. When i called her out, there were even instances when she said 'thats why you should go speak to your counselor, your emotions wouldn't be so messed up anymore'. (I saw a counselor a few times for some other reasons) On the other hand, she claims that she's a very open minded person and even confidently told me that some of her friends also agree but tbh, if she's open minded then why can't she accept my opinions?From my observations, my girlfriend's mum is also leaning towards the manipulative side. I'm not sure if she picked that up since childhood. Can anyone please advise me on how to let her see that she's hurting me? On good days i can put up with it but sometimes i just feel that I'm not entitled to my own thoughts.-#99752: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99752","['Like: 12 people', 'Haha: 6 people', 'Care: 4 people']",30 comments,1 share
99751,"If I were a parent, I would totally expose my children to sex education early. Boy: to teach him how to wear a condom. How to make himself feel good aka masturbate. Maybe even introducing him to some tenga. It's normal to feel pleasure. Nothing to be embarrassed about.Girl: even though I'm a guy, I'm still aware of the monthly menstrual cycle that ladies have. When that happens, don't even need to wait for the mother to appear. I'll bring her to the supermarket to buy pads. I've seen so many fathers and guys shun the pad section. Come on. It's like diapers. It absorbs stuff. What's so scary about it. The older generation thinks touching it is not good and suay but hello? It's a product please. I'll help her read reviews and what not to help her decide on the pad she wants. Similar to guys, I'll also tell her about condoms and safe sex. Always. ALWAYS make sure the guy wears a condom. No condom just kick the balls and go. It's ok to teach children about sex at an early age, maybe around 16-18. It's the period when they explore and know more about their bodies. What's so embarrassing about it? Last but not least, I'll make an agreement with them: when you are at home, if you are doing something ordinary, like watching YouTube or Netflix, you can open door for air ventilation. If you want full on privacy to 'discover' yourself, close the door and lock it. If you are studying or working and don't want to be disturbed, close the door and leave it ajar a bit, using a door stopper. Not going to spy on you. Not going to harp on you. Just be sure that whatever you do, be safe and not harm anyone. It's about time the conventional mindset of sex gets replaced with new ones. Oh and just a note, not even going to care if my children or lesbians or gays, love is all that matters.

99747,"I wish to stand up for the F&Bs on campus, cos I feel like they are so essential but so overlooked in NUS. I enjoy striking up conversations with canteen aunties and staff from cafes & restaurants. I feel their pain when they share how the past 18 months have been for them.A few points to bring up for discussion:1. NUS doesn't allow visitors. This rule is stricter than government mandated - our vendors lose customers from nearby Science Parks, general public, etc. Though this appears discretionary on the part of NUS, no further rental rebate has been given to compensate for this (I verified with several stalls/sources)2. Saturation of vendors. Every now and then, some new space is up for tender at some corner of campus. I mean, who doesn't love more variety right?! The issue is that the size of the pie remains the same. So some vendors face the problem of competitors selling the same stuff in their vicinity. Not a great look for them, especially since there's low volume on campus nowadays. But hey, maybe NUS is pressurising their leasing office to raise revenue?3. The attitude of NUS towards vendors. Don't @ me, the vendors I talked to only agreed to divulge some stuff after I sumpa I won't reveal any clues on who they are. On top of demanding strict compliance to rules that they make up, NUS' stance is generally along the lines of ""if you don't follow, then this will factor in when this space is up for retender. We don't forget de..."" In this climate where F&B vendors are at their literal wits' end on how to keep their business going, the least they can do is not to pile on even more stress?! I fear that serious operators who are running a great show now may not have the money to sustain or go up against the marketing dollars of big brands (which NUS lovesssss). How do I know? Cos my parents belong in this category. I want them to keep doing what they're passionate about, but I know they're facing an uphill battle.Jiayou!!!!!~-#99747: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99747","['Like: 25 people', 'Care: 7 people', 'Sad: 3 people']",1 comment,4 shares
99744,"The only people deserving of any attention as a result of their lives being affected by the closure of YNC are the people to whom the school was the only source of income. Period. Everyone else is just overreacting. Did I miss the part where they announced that all YNC diplomas will no longer be recognized? Did I miss the part where it is suddenly technologically possible to confiscate the memories of the college experience of YNC graduates and students? We had universities close down before. JCs merge all the time. Primary schools are shut down all the time. Why is it that the dissolution of an institution that has only been around for 10 years is causing an uproar that we’d only expect if they announced Harvard was gonna shut down? I’ve always heard rumors that YNC students were snobby and elitist. But only after reading through the unending stream of whingy and incredibly (and unnecessarily) long status updates of my JC friends who went to YNC have I truly understood how much these people really think they go to Yale. It is also now clear that for a group of people who like to use the word “privilege,” they certainly have great difficulty checking their own.I know people who have gone to the real Ivies in the US. My neighbor went to the University of Pennsylvania. A PSC scholar friend of mine did her masters at some other Ivy, maybe Cornell. I never got the sense that they were a fraction as self-righteous as YNC graduates. Now why is that? Is the education at YNC really that much more liberal compared to actual liberal arts colleges in the land of the free? Or is it instead true that people who attended the really Ivies are better able to make the much-needed distinction between things that matter and things that do not matter that much. Surely there are other things to spend time and energy campaigning for? I get that you’re pissed that your school is shutting down. But honestly, have a sense of damn proportion. Everyone who has ever earned a degree at Yale-NUS would have more history themselves than the school has. This isn’t just me being facetious. We gotta be able to point out things that don’t make sense. As willing as I am to empathize with the importance of history and culture, YNC has none of either. Just because your school has closed down doesn’t invalidate the experiences you had at the school. I mean, even if NUS announced it was gonna shut down tomorrow I’d just be interested in whether my degree will still be recognized. They are shutting the school down, not you down.-#99744: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99744","['Like: 14 people', 'Haha: 2 people']",0 Comments,0 Shares

We dated for about a year but did not have any sexual intimacy and we only tried doing it about 1 month before we broke up.

I suspect he is a closet gay and he's using me as a gf to hide his sexuality as his family is very traditional. He has these following traits: high enthusiasm towards skincare, his love of selfies especially with a pout expression,  weird experimental fashion sense. One of his signature pose is to cross his leg very tightly everytime he sits. (Normal people does leg over knee while he does leg over thigh.)Hence, if anyone knows someone who worked as cabin crew and fits into this category.

99727,"My ex cheated on me mid last year after 10 months of emotional manipulation, gaslighting and verbal abuse despite my constant understanding and love. I gave up everything and let him tear down my confidence and mental health only for him to cheat on me, block me on social media and leave me crying begging outside his house. I was stupid. He owns a car but never liked picking me up or sending me home (he only lived 10 minutes away from me), he has a stable job and has quite a bit of free time but never liked meeting me more than once a week, even that one date is like a short 2-4 hours. Fast forward to today, I am happily attached to a man who loves me, doesn't own a car but will fetch me from my house for every date, always wants to spend time with me and showers me with gifts (even the smallest ones like a cup of my favourite coffee, or a note with a cheesy pick-up line). Guess what? My ex unblocked me, followed me back on my socials and even messaged me with an apology. I haven't posted a single pic of my current bf on my socials so he probably thinks I'm single so I decided to just play around with him a little cos it's funny that he's texting me so earnestly now after being able to ignore my message for weeks on end. Asked me how I was and kept following up with questions even when my answers were short as hell like ""yeah haha"" ""oh ya"" ""okay ah"" ""ohhh"", after one full day, I got tired of replying him and deleted the chat, ghosting him and posted a pic of my bf and I on igstory for him to see.Feeling like a bad bitch but feel kinda bad too lmao Moral of the story: Guys, if you don't cherish your girl now, she'll become someone else's and you'll no longer have a spot in her heart. If you love someone, stay loyal and don't even think of doing anything funny. Not just for guys, but girls too.

I met many unsavoury people there, and want to avoid them as much as I can. Of course, that’s still no reason to close a college.Went to their open house about two years ago with my sister (my sister’s a liberal arts kinda person and believed that YNC > FASS). The professors there were super snobbish and the vibe there was also pretty unwelcoming as well. To this day, I still fucking hate the guys that treated my little sister like dirt for the 15 minutes we were there.And they were pretty superficial as well. I tend to speak in a more formal and polished accent than my little sister, so even though I wasn’t interested in YNC at all they somehow treated me better than my sister. It was the shittiest open house I’ve ever been toI mean, there’s also the somewhat substantial probability I’m biased against YNC students due to this experience, but for the love of god I can’t stand it when the people I know who attended YNC speak out as if they’re holier than thou.A much, much better and down-to-earth argument would have been that you were scammed into thinking that the Yale-NUS degree conferred great employment opportunities and merging into USP was NOT what you signed up for when your first enrolled into it.The arguments made about Yale-NUS being the safe space for discussions is a huge reach. Don’t speak about keeping Yale-NUS as if you’re doing something good and great for society, cause I’m extremely skeptical that YNC has done anything substantial for the general public.-#99710: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99710","['Like: 17 people', 'Haha: 7 people']",0 Comments,10 comments

Why I was not moved there - because my headcount is under the current department I’m in. So I was thrown all the other work to do, things that are completely not within my expertise. I’ve been trying to learn for the past 10 months and I feel like my patience is running out.. there are so many things that I feel so lost in and there’s completely no guidance by seniors or my boss at work, because they’re just too busy. In my recent work review, my boss said I am very quiet and low key, and I highlighted to her I’m trying to learn on the job. I think the comment really discouraged me as I can’t seem to speak anything during meetings for the fear of saying the wrong things. I don’t think I should leave this job so early at 10 months because I believe I should gain more experience, yet the lack of exposure and me constantly feeling so lost at work makes me feel so useless.

99696,"I don't get why there are so many posts complaining about unwanted pregnancies. I know the sex ed in sg is bad, but don't they always tell you condoms are not 100% effective? The only 100% effective way is abstinence. If you don't have sex, you can't get pregnant, simple as that.FYI, I'm not coming at it from a religious perspective here (I'm an atheist). But the fact is that as girls, the burden of unwanted pregnancy is 99% going to be borne by us. Both the pregnancy itself, and the childcare that comes after.Yes there's always the possibility of abortion. Don't get me wrong, abortion is always preferable to giving birth to an unwanted child, and I'm glad it's legal in sg. But it also costs time and money, and might lead to complications affecting your long-term health and fertility. None of which the guy has to bother about, of course.If a guy doesn't want to be a father, he can just run. You can't run from your own body. Sure, you can go to court and drag him for child support, but that takes months and thousands in lawyer fees. Or maybe your families force you to get married, which never ends well if the child is the only factor tying you two together, dooming you to decades of an unhappy marriage. Is it worth it for five minutes of pleasure?And if a guy insists that you must have sex because it's what bf/gf do/all his ex-gfs did it...dump his ass.

99694,"[Controversial] This is in response to those who argue that Yale-NUS students are living in their own bubble because they did not bother fighting for other schools' (i.e. CHS) mergers and were not even concerned about the mergers of JCs a few years back. I am saying this as a FASS student. They are not obliged to fight against other schools' mergers - after all, it's not even their school. Why are we expecting Yale-NUS students to fight for our schools first, to gain the 'right' to fight for their school? In the first place, why are we expecting Yale-NUS students to fight for our school? Do we expect NTU students to fight against NUS' decision of merging Yale-NUS and USP too? I really don't see a problem for Yale-NUS students to be extra 'loud' when it comes to their own school's merger, it just shows that they really care a lot about their school and hence are willing to fight for it. FASS and FoS have a large student population. We could have been 'loud' even without Yale-NUS students' support, but we weren't. Can we really say that Yale-NUS students are being selfish for not fighting together with us when most of us haven't really done much to fight against our school's merger? Another common argument I see online is that Yale-NUS students are whining over their loss of history and culture, but their feelings are invalid because other JCs with longer history have merged without much issues. Yale-NUS students supposedly have a 'holier than thou attitude', and they would be better off crying about the loss of their prestige so that it won't be hypocritical. I am pretty sure they did cry about their loss of prestige though (which is very understandable in my opinion, after all, they managed to enter Yale-NUS which has a super low acceptance rate). If you read the articles, you might have noticed that some of them rejected top schools around the world for Yale-NUS. Imagine paying such a huge opportunity cost (rejecting top schools, paying large tuition fees, etc.) only to get a degree from a college that will be defunct a few years later. While it may not be a big deal for your primary/secondary/JC to close down, it is a pretty big deal for your university to close down. Do you think employers give more fucks about your pri/sec/JC education over your university education?Back to the point on how Yale-NUS' history is comparably short in contrast with other merged JCs, I just want to highlight that the point here is not about how old the institutions are, but how strong the connection between current students and alumni are. Speaking from personal experience, since we only spend 2 years of our lives in JC and don't really get to connect with the alumni, we don't really form a connection with our JC's history - even if it's longer. In contrast, Yale-NUS has a strong alumni network, their students are also more invested in the college's development and culture, and hence it makes sense as to why they would be more concerned about the college's history and culture.Lastly, please stop making arguments along the lines of ""Back when JCs/faculties/schools merged, did YNC students even care? Did they not care because it doesn't concern them?"" I mean, duh? Are you trying to say that in order to fight for their school to not close down, they should have fought against the school mergers back in 2019, when some of them were NOT even in YNC? Are we really expecting Yale-NUS students to fight for every cause remotely relevant to them? I'm sure many of us don't, because if they do, we will see them as ""noisy, liberal arts students who want to have a say in everything and disrupt our society."" I think we are really expecting too much from them. As much as we believe they live in a bubble (yes, I think they do sometimes), but these arguments are really unfair to YNC students. I hope that before we argue against their cause, we should ask ourselves if we are being overly harsh, just because we think they are royalties who deserve to learn more about how harsh the world can be.-#99694: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99694",['Like: 19 people'],0 Comments,1 comment

The press released articles on the so called “merger” literally 5 minutes befor TEC announced it in a very wordy and lengthy town hall which was more like a monologue - this means even the press knew about this before the main stakeholders. NUS pressured us to pay our fees in multiple emails prior to August 27th, and released this statement on the payment deadline. Students who could have transferred out were prevented from doing so. Internationals who came to Singapore to receive a world class education found their school shut down in week 2 of classes. We hurt for our admin and admissions staff, who now seem reduntant since there will not be any new applicants. We hurt for all the organizations and movements we have started, such as SUs during Covid (yes YNC StuGov fought so hard for it,  it carried over to NUS) or our very strict sexual misconduct policies. All of these efforts will now go to waste. Our siblings will not be able to witness the relationships and community we have built.

I haven’t disclosed this to anyone yet.I am currently working full time and studying part time for my masters degree at NUS. I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years. Since last year he has been hinting at starting a family as he is in his 30s already. I told him I still wanted to further my studies and wasn’t very interested in having children. He has always been against me taking up an additional degree saying it’s a drag and useless. I didnt really care since I’m paying with my own savings. The thing is, whenever we have sex it’s always with protection. But over this weekend when my boyfriend was out, I had some suspicions and found that his stash of condoms had a few tiny holes and also a sewing needle under the box. Right now I’m feeling so lost, I can’t concentrate at work or school. I’m so angry that he deliberately got me pregnant but at the same time what can I do if I confront him right? I’m already pregnant! I’m barely halfway through this degree, and now I’m just thinking if I will ever be able to graduate. All the effort, the tens of thousands of dollars forked out all gone down the drain. At 25 I’m not ready to handle the responsibilities of having a child but at the same time I don’t think I could go down the abortion route… I would just feel too guilty given that I’m no longer a child and am financially able to.

They've been on vacations together without me because I trusted both of them and she was dating someone else at the time anyway, but now that they're together it makes me wonder if they were doing funny business while I was still dating him...

99660,"NUS Admin please let me pass this post:I want to teach you guys how to pick University and courses, feel free to comment below.I am excluding those who going to top tier international universities, from rich families, and those who wants to study PhD. Only take the following courses if you have these privileges, or else avoid these courses. You might not get a job after graduating.Courses to avoid: chemical engineering, bioengineering, economics, finance, marketing, hotel management, aerospace engineering, biotechnology, all pure science subjects (such as mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology), all linguistics, tourism management, human resources, history, business management, life science, mass communication, public relations, logistics, philosophy, advertising.Recommended courses: engineering (excluding chemistry, biology and aerospace), computer science, nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy, accounting, medicine, law, actuarial science, architecture, psychology. Anything that your parents think there's future and let you make a killing. These are usually courses focusing on application/practicality.Next, you need to know that only certificates from the following Malaysian University are recognized by most Singapore companies (or some companies). Don't regret when you got 4.0 for your CGPA and rejected by them because they don't recognize your University.Recommended Universities:Top 5 government Universities - UM, USM, UKM, UTM, UPMPrivate Universities - UTAR, UCSI, Monash, IMU, MMU, TARUC, Nottingham, Taylor, APU, etc.Don't look for government or private Universities that Malaysian never heard of and have no ranking. They will likely give out fake certificates (diploma/degree mill) which will be useless (unless you plan to work in Malaysia for the rest of your life).-#99660: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99660","['Like: 7 people', 'Angry: 2 people', 'Care: 1 person']",11 comments,2 shares

She only explains the side that she feels I wronged her but seldom or never the side of story when she’s at fault.It honestly hurts me knowing what she really thinks about me yet doesn’t tell me about it, and I feel really wrong and framed..She doesn’t know that I know she had been posting about me and I do not plan on confronting her because it might be a safe space for her to rant knowing that it’ll stay anonymous..How do I bring it up to her and get her to be open about it without letting her know that I know she’s been posting here? Or should I just leave it and let her be?Also, I’ve also seen some of these comments asking us to break up.

99654,"Funny story guys. I was on the mrt and there were two girls standing nearby. They seemed to be new acquaintances, possibly new colleagues, based on the conversation topics. One girl mentioned she was from NUS . The other proudly responded that she was from Yale. The NUS girl was impressed and asked about the Yale girl’s school life. After a few minutes of further conversation, the NUS girl came to a realization “oh you mean Yale-NUS.” You could sense the palpable eyeroll in her tone.The situation was too funny I couldn’t stop giggling. This reminds me of people who go on exchange for a summer at Harvard and suddenly their Facebook and linkedin profiles show Harvard as their university.

They did not close down. FASS Club and Science Club are still here. The College of Humanities and Sciences is NOT a merger between FASS and FOS! It is the creation of a common curriculum between the two entities and allowing students who want to take majors across both faculties an easier path. Is that not expanding options for students? Is that not what these people want? To claim that such mergers will restrict academic programmes is completely unfounded. In fact, it is the breaking down of barriers! I am glad my juniors who are interested in Physical Geography can now access Biology and Chemistry and even Physics modules and major/minor programmes and more importantly faculty and facilities and resources, to enrich their knowledge.Yes, perhaps the way NUS is doing things can be improved.

99638,"Dating and finding a partner is toxic. This is my personal experience. Every other aspect of my life is pretty great actually. I work in a 9-6 job and the pay is average but should be sufficient to run a family. Work is interesting and fun despite the average pay. My work ends strictly at 6 so I don't have to think about work after that. After that, I go home and exercise. I am not Dwayne Johnson but I have a average fit body. I also help my parents with the chore and/or just spend time talking to them. After that, I spend time on my hobby.My passion is miniature painting which is a little costly but I am able to save up to indulge. It is so so much fun designing and painting/sculpting/modeling miniatures that I can think of a gazillion ways to do things. I spend quite a lot of time working on my hobby and often enter the ""zone"".On weekends, I spend time with nephews and nieces. I teach them math and sciences and/or just play with them board games/sports like badminton. Since I am teaching them, they have stopped going to tuition and  I used to do volunteering but I had to stop after COVID unfortunately. I do look forward to doing volunteering work once the situation gets better.In all, I feel very satisfied, fulfilled and happy with the way my life is now. However, I have had a terrible experience with the dating part. I am above 30 so age is one factor. I am not that great looking. I have been said to be the most ugliest guy in my class both in secondary and jc. I have stood in a line of 13 guys where I was ranked last in terms of looks. I am also balding due to age so the front part of my head is thinning very badly that you can see it a couple of meters away.Despite all the negative aspects of my looks, I try to do my best and stay positive. I am taking some pills given by the doctor to slow down the balding. I try to dress as well as I can. My initial experience with dating apps were quite bad. I had no matches. My friends were getting matches and were already on dates. I asked my friends for advice. They asked me to remove pics of me painting miniatures which was my hobby. They asked me to take a pic of me with a dog. They also asked me to change my dressing style although initially, my dressing style was similar to most of my friends. Amazingly, I started to get a few matches although the number was very low. There were 2 dressing styles that worked. The first one was the ah beng style but it only got matches, nothing more. The second one was the rich looking style with the suit and expensive looking hotel background. I even got to go on a couple of dates.Two things happened in the dates. When they asked about hobbies and I told them about mine, they usually looked a little doubtful or sometimes a little turn-off-ish. The second thing is when I tell them my job, they realise that I am not exactly a rich person. They would either scold me for ""catfishing"", a term that I only learnt then or they just slowly ghost me after that. I told my friends of my experience and they asked me to just become rich. A little back story, I used to work in a really high paying job. The issue was that it was very stressful and the work never ends. I had to do a lot of OT, client meals and when I got home, my mind would still be thinking about work. I had no time for myself or anyone around me. I had to study or do prep work on weekends (no pay) just to ensure that my quality of work does not drop. I could somewhat handle the stress but the major problem was that I had no time for anyone around me, including myself. I did not see the point in earning so much money if I cannot spend time with people I care about.After I quit, things changed so much. My parents feel happier with me being around and I can help with them with their problems. I also have more time for myself - fitness and hobbies.When I told my friends why I am not going back to the high paying job, they said that the biggest problem with my approach is that I am trying to be someone I am not and that I am trying too hard. They said that I should be happy with my life first before I can get a gf. This made me quite frustrated because everything in my original profile was genuinely myself and I was already happy before I made the changes according to their suggestions. When I updated my profile to my photos that genuinely showed myself for who I am, I got zero matches. It is like back to square one again.By the way, the guy who was advising me to be happy with myself was actually suffering from depression. He managed to get the gf during his depression and somehow they worked it out. They eventually got married a couple of years later.Sidetrack, why not meet up through groups or social circles?This goes a little way back. As I mentioned, I am not that good looking. Throughout secondary school and JC, I have been rejected by girls when I proposed to them. Some of them turned me down nicely while some have blatantly said mean things to me. The worst insult that I ever received was ""I would rather die than be with you (and showed the sign of vomiting)"". Despite being rejected every time, I would still try to stay positive and move forward although it was hard. Uni experience was the same but everyone rejected nicely.As I mentioned, I used to volunteer. In general, the people there are usually more friendly and nicer. I was able to click with a lot of guys and girls. I even got very close to some of them to the point where they would share their very personal stories/issues with me. However, most of them were attached. Even if they were not attached, they would get attached to someone within the group or they would find someone else from their class. I tried to approach a few of them with whom I could click but all them rejected me. When I asked for a reason, they would give vague excuse like ""We are too different"" or ""I am not ready for relationship now"". The girl who said that she is not ready for relationship got into one the next week! I could not understand why I was not able to find someone despite being able to be close with people in the group. My friend explained this (roughly his words, not exact), ""I am going to tell the brutal truth. If we give numbers on a scale of 10, you would be 8 personality, 5 money, -100 looks. If I was a girl, and in the worst case scenario, I would still prefer someone who is 5 personality, 5 money 5 looks or in even worst worst case 5 personality, 8 money 1 looks. You are such a low bar to beat. Why would they pick you when they know they can definitely find someone who is definitely better than you.""I am still trying on dating apps. Now, there are dating apps that still has a little priority of substance over looks but when they see the photo or meet in real life, same thing happens.I feel that it is like a cycle. I am happy as I am but cannot find a romantic partner. People tell me to change. When I change and fail, they ask me to be happy and take of myself first. but i was fine in the first place?. Then, the process repeats. I have done this nonsense a couple of times with no difference. As much as I am happy with my status quo, I do want to have a family. I want a wife and kids just like my nephews and nieces. I have seen my friends finding someone and marrying that person within the span of 1-2 years. I always believed that my time will come despite the numerous failures. I have been trying to be positive for so darn long but recently, I have actually really finally started to doubt my prospects of finding someone.

99625,"Let’s face it, the only reason Yale-NUS students are sour about the dissolution of their university is probably because they think the word “Yale” somehow makes them atas and exclusive. At the end of the day, these people still earn NUS degrees and if they’re not happy with the nomenclature, it doesn’t matter how much they try to mansplain, we all know why.Yale-NUS has been an abomination from the start. No Ivy League university has ever tried to taint their reputation by selling out their brand in such a way. When they do so it is almost always set up as a dual-degree program where students are awarded two separate degrees from two separate institutions. Such as Harvard and Berklee, or Columbia and Science Po. As naff as dual degree programs are, they do not constitute a sell out because their cohorts are usually very small, and students would have gotten into either university. Yale-NUS students would not have gotten into Yale, as much as they would have you believe otherwise. It’s not as if their degrees are all suddenly being classified as unaccredited.

99618,"To the writer of #99273 Working with people that are so much more senior than yourself is not easy. I had work with a few colleagues in the sixties previously, and thankfully I was the most junior position and didn’t have to manage them. People in the beyond retirement age fall into vaguely 2 groups 1. The nice ones that are ready to retire, and will teach the young ones their wisdom 2. The spiteful ones that fear the young ones as they want their job and is afraid of you stealing their bowl, at this age, if they lose their current job, they don’t have much places that would hire them. The ones that will tell you they ate more salt than you ate rice. It sound like it will be tough to manage this subordinate. Based on the facts that you have provided 1. Currently 67 and in contractual role —> He/She applied for a promotion when he/she is 65, the retirement age. When mostpeople would be fearful if they would get let go. And contract role means he/she have the fear of not getting renewed.My advice,1. Leave. As your boss still appreciates your subordinate, and base on history it doesn’t sounds like he will support you. And this company sounds toxic already. If you leave during probation, just leave it out of your previous experience during your job hunt. Learn how to spot for toxicity in work place. Ask during interviews such as the most challenging part of the job, what caused the position to be empty. Is the company very desperate to get you on board? 2. If you want to stay, it’s not going to be easy. But below are somethings to try: Firstly, give up your pride as a manager and show him/her respect just for being your 40 years senior, your subordinate is afterall at least the age of your parents. Treat him/her like you would treat your parents. Also, don’t expect professionalism from him/her as of current, you took the position he/she wanted. There will be pettiness and jealousy involved. Second, have meals with him/her. This is the best time to talk and understand people.Third, (the hard one) bootlick him/her, words are cheap anyway. Tell him/her how awesome he/she is for staying in this company for so long. Can ask him/her for tips on working in this company in general, try not to go to assignment details. (Rmb he/she fears that you will steal his/her rice bowl if you know and can do what he/she is doing)Fixed the relationship first.And I don’t agree on buying food as it is expensive unless you trying to chase her.

We have both been dating for quite a long time, almost a decade together and settling down end of this year.. To make my mother happy, my boyfriend will be joining my religion. This topic has always been very sensitive and important for the both of us since he does not come from a family who believed in God and I do. In the beginning of the first few months we started dating, I told him being with me is not going to be easy at all as I come from a religious family. He said he don’t mind and said to let the future decide for us and if he has to be part of us, he’ll be willing to be part of us.Today I found out that my boyfriend is not happy that he needs to pretend that he believes in God just so my mother could allow us to get married. He told me that he resents me for making him do this and I got really hurt when he said that. I have told him many times that he does not need to do this and he can find someone who accepts him for who he is but he kept saying he will do it and because he loves me, he wants to do it. It has been days now that I haven’t talk to him because my heart is confused. I love him so much but at the same time I do not want to go into a marriage with him resenting me for doing something he does not want to do and before everyone attacks me and calls me a mummy’s girl and how her opinion should not matter in our marriage - my mother is the only person I have left in this world and her health is bad too and I do not wish to do something or against what she believes in and make her more sick as I’ve lost my father a decade ago too. He did apologise for using the word resentment and admitted that it was a harsh word. I don’t know what to do anymore now. I don’t want to go into marriage life knowing that he has this feelings buried deep down in his heart.. I am at the verge of letting him go and be happy with someone else.

99600,"My partner has been keeping me in the dark about this lady colleague of his for nearly a year . Found out when she texted him bout buying coffee for him before work on workweeks and out if curiosity i ask why he didnt mention about the new colleagues existence given they have to work w each other closely. I dug deeper and found out he send her home sometimes (many of his colleagues drive btw) and even msg her off work to chitchat, go for after work group runs, lunches etc. He had also mentioned to his colleagues he found her cute and petite . He would mention every single one of his colleague who went lunch w him except for her while we were chatting about our day- lying by omission. A girl’s intuition is crazy. I recall once I had asked who adjusted my front seat jokingly and he asked if im thinking that he has been fetching girls home and if so stop acting “crazy”. Thought about it when im alone and it felt as though he is gaslighting me.  He felt that it is not necessary to mention it to me as i might misunderstood and since she will be rotating out of the department in 2 weeks time it is not necessary to let me know at all. And the phase will “pass”. I had expressed that if it is normal communications i will not bother and requested to look at his messages infront of him. He became defensive and raised his voice saying that i am intruding his privacy . After some fiddling with his phone (presumably deleting some text) he decided to show me the text and indeed they text on weekend about non work related stuff on a level i would consider crossing the line- spoke about boundaries a year ago . More recently i found out he has been exchanging socials and phone number with a online gaming female friend, chatting her up (non game related , personal work rant, sharing how shag his or her work is and totally flirty with the “hahahahaha why drinks no jio? Jio next time ah hehehehe” “ok i e-jio u next time when i drink so we can drink together hehehehehe”- i actually lost it as i cannot believe a grown man who is in his 30s will comms in such a manner and he had told me any friendship online will stay online). He had the intention to meet her up behind my back- this broke my heart. I recognized the notification pop up and asked who is he chatting up at 3 am while we are having drinks at our friends and he brushed me off. He usually chat with her when not beside him and he wud pretend to go mia/ fall asleep and all these while he was chatting with the girl. How is he keeping up with all these ? Wish to have honest input from the guys perspective. We are in talks to purchase a house and settle down soon- and his resolution for the matter is “i will not do it again” .

99599,"Hi everyone, please listen to my story and kindly share an idea or suggestion. Thank you!I am 23 years old. Me and my boyfriend are together for 2 years+. We have a stable relationship, we hardly fight or argue. He really treats me the best and I have a strong relationship with his family as well. Nowadays, things have changed from my side. I m kind of interested in another guy at work. The moment I realised it by myself, I thought it’s just temporary and a little bit of flirting for awhile. I did feel bad for my bf as well. I was like why I m feeling like this. I know something is not right. The worst part is the other guy is in my head 24/7 even if I am spending time with my boyfriend. The reason I fell for the other guy is mostly because of his look (he is totally my type but my bf is not) and the chemistry between us. At work, I realised I enjoy talking to other guy and I can feel that he has mutual feelings for me too. We will talk to each other during break time or whenever available. I can see the sparkling in his eyes when we were talking too. I did try my best to stay away from him at work but couldn’t help usually. But so far, we never text or go out after work as he is also in a long distance relationship. We both know that we are attached. I really don’t know what to do. I really feel bad for my bf cos he really deserves better than me. My family is overseas and I am alone here. Sometimes I wonder, do I really love my boyfriend or i just want his/ his family’s accompany. If I decide to break up, i am gonna be alone, i will not have anyone to celebrate X’mas, CNY, birthday, etc which I really hate. To be honest, I have never been single for so long as I dated this boyfriend right after my previous relationship. I kind of feel like I should ask myself whether I want commitment or mot. I am not sure, I really don’t know what I want because this is a stable relationship and i kind of ruining it now. At the same time, I have no intention to break the other guy’s relationship as well. It has only been a week. Can you guys advise me? What do you all think from the situation? Do I really like the other guy or just enjoying the flirting feeling?Should I give myself a little more time and see whether they are just temporary feelings? Or, should I tell my boyfriend honestly, break up and focus on myself? Or what else should I do? Thank you for reading my story everyone.-#99599: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99599","['Like: 23 people', 'Haha: 21 people', 'Wow: 5 people']",71 comments,17 shares
99598,"I am a Yale-NUS alum, and I am not too sad that YNC is gone because this place contains many awful memories, even traumatic ones for me. I cannot say these without anonymising myself because I am scared of the people on the internet. People on social media are painting an overly positive image of YNC and the community. Don’t get me wrong, I think there are lots of wonderful students, staff and faculty on campus, but there are definitely a few of them who have made other people’s lives extremely miserable. To respect privacy, I won’t list out what happened, but everyone can get a gist of it by browsing the news on YNC or Octant.The lack of transparency has been an issue for a long time and many people have been trying to push for greater transparency in communication/policy on campus. However, many times, whenever someone demand such, there will be a group of students who become protective of the college admin and show solidarity with them rather than their fellow peers who are trying to advocate for their benefit. While these students may come from a good position, their siding with the admin in reality weaken the demand for transparency (“see, only a vocal minority wants change”). Of course, the advocacy may not be the most well-phrased at times, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they are worthless (please these students are young adults who are still learning!). Admin are people, so are the students who demand transparency. Some of these admin defenders are now angry at the lack of transparency this time — but where were you when those of us needed your support in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020?I know when I say this, the comment section may be populated by comments like “imperfections so what - you perfect one meh?” “My experience is positive, why you draw hate?” No one is perfect, does that mean we cannot comment or criticise on everything at all in our lives? If you don’t want me to draw hate to your beloved college, stop yourself or your friends from creating bad memories for others.-#99598: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99598","['Like: 14 people', 'Sad: 4 people']",0 Comments,3 comments

Transferring to an Ivy League is even harder that being accepted as first year students…Please do not mention acceptance rate because the pool of students who apply to Yale are generally more competitive than Yale-NUS, and Yale receives far more applications a year.

99568,"Controversial. Please do not delete. Meant to encourage discourse.As a YNS alum, I'm actually glad about the decision to dissolve YNS because it has been from the start, a manifestation of Singaporean prestige-whoring to just a ridiculous degree. This whole experiment has never not been confusing. Why would Yale, a tier-one research institution whose affiliates have won multiple Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes, whose alumni have gone on to become American presidents and supreme court justices, be interested in lending their star-studded history in a project with a university a fraction of its stature? Were it not for the money that they stood to earn for the project, an Ivy League university like Yale would never in a million years consider such a collaboration, especially if it means its name has to be bastardized in such a way. They could just have easily called it anything else. Literally anything else. We have done it before. SUTD wasn't named MIT-NUS, and SMU wasn't named Wharton-NUS. Clearly something was fishy from the start. This didn't matter to my parents, to whom the word ""Yale"" was all they needed to force a decision onto me. This project occurred because Yale was willing to pimp out its brand for a good sum of money, and someone was willing to sanction any decision to make NUS seem a lot more world-class than it actually is. YNS students were never going to be good enough to be admitted to Yale. You can cite acceptance rates and whatever but the fact is that these numbers are inflated. It costs nothing to send an application to Yale-NUS as a Yale prospect, and Yale-NUS clearly wasn't going to jeopardize their yield by accepting students who were never going to come to Singapore anyway. If we simply removed all those Americans whose applications have indicated that they wished to apply to Yale-NUS, just out of convenience and not out of sincerity, the acceptance rate would probably turn out similar to NUS.What we end up getting is a bunch of holier-than-thou SJW-types who would have otherwise have no choice but to be in NUS, being banded together in an echo chamber where far-left ideas, on pain of excommunication, are never held to the acid test of textbook Singaporean pragmatism.Wasn't it a Yale-NUS alumni who got themselves into trouble after releasing a viral video that clearly demonstrates the kind of ""frontier justice"" that promotes aggressive activism? I actually stand by them in principle. But the idea that the only way to change a society is by being angry is childish. If we could change the prejudices of the older generation overnight, LKY wouldn't have had to take his entire life to fail to fix the third-world mentality in Singapore. The decision to wind up the college is good. Liberalism is mostly good.

She knows his family and extended family while I have yet to meet any despite being in a relationship with him for a year. Im not particularly concerned about their relationship but my friends kept telling me that something is very off about this friendship dynamic. My bf had previously confessed to his female friend 3 times over 4 years but she turned him down and they remained as good friends. She’s not in any of his cliques so they often hung out 1-on-1. Each time they went out to eat with one another (~every 2-3 months) he would drive up to fetch her and bring her to a high end restaurants, and the bill often goes up to $300++, of which he pays for it 8/10 times. Their meetups often lasted between 4-6 hours everytime, which others say its relatively long for a catch up session as it could go slightly past midnight occasionally. However, he always make sure to keep me updated when he meet with him. On the other hand, he would bring me to eat in hawker centres, fast food places or purchase ready made food from 7-11/donki, not that I complain because they’re delicious! But we never had a fancy date due to budget constraints and i always paid for my share of the meals too or even pay for both of our meals.

My friends are saying that treating a friend, particularly someone he used to like (or still likes) for expensive meals while not doing the same for me, his gf, is a red flag and i should have a talk with him about it. As he was very open about his interactions with his female friend to me and is willing to disclose such information, i generally do not feel jealous or be suspicious about it.

99396,"I am 25 and I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD a few years ago. In the beginning, it was very distressing and crippling to the extent where it would interfere with my daily activities and life. One time I had a major anxiety attack and refused to leave a public toilet for 4 hours, which led to my parents freaking out bc I was uncontactable and we had a family dinner that evening. It then got better when I started uni in September that same year. The first two years were a challenge bc I had a heavy workload and was constantly feeling anxious and on edge all the time. Little things would trigger me easily. Things got better during the third year onwards when my psychiatrist started prescribing me a medication that worked for me and my condition. However, my anxiety/OCD did not fully go away. It would still come and go whenever it pleases. However, I have to say that during the last few years, my condition has improved a lot. It would occasionally come and when it does, it is serious, but not as serious as the toilet incident.Anyway, my gf and I went to the arcade one night. We were having such a good time, until the last 5 mins of our visit there when we were counting our tickets. She wanted to do something which I didn’t want her to bc I knew it wouldn’t work. She went ahead and did it anyway, which really triggered my anxiety and my OCD started to flare up. In the moment, I said to her “I told you alr right, you so stupid.” I knew I fucked up right after bc she really hates it when people call her stupid/dumb and I could also tell from her facial expression. She also has a very bad temper. We didn’t talk at all during the whole ride back from suntec to Yishun. I was depressed again.Even though my gf knows about my mental condition and we’ve been together for a year, I don’t think she fully understands what I’m going through and the extent of my condition (which I don’t blame her at all bc even my parents don’t get it and I’ve been told many times by people and my ex-counselor that these are all “irrational” thoughts).

99395,"TLDR; I recently found out my boyfriend of 3 years paid for sex (prostitutes) when he was younger and question his values because he introduced the world of prostitutes to his married brother.This is gonna be REALLY long, but I'm seeking for advice on my situation. I have a boyfriend of 3 years and he really loves me (vice versa). He will always put my needs before him and is faithful during the span of our relationship. However, I recently found out about something he did when he was in his early 20s that makes me question him/our relationship. To elaborate on what happened, he was young and single (and kind of desperate) back then, so he paid for prostitutes to satisfy his needs. I understand from his standpoint because they have their needs, and his only outlet then was paying for sex. I guess it's the same idea as people having one-night stand and the only difference is he paid for it so I'm actually not judging his promiscuous lifestyle back then since it was before he met me. But what made me angry/sad was his selfishness of not letting me know when we first started this relationship, and instead only telling me 3 years down our relationship (read along the lines of potentially contracting STDs). Yes, he got himself checked and he is clear (but what if the hypothetical 0.000001% chance he was not?). I personally feel that he is really selfish for not letting me know and he could at least let me know out of respect at the start of our relationship. Whether or not I want to commit to this relationship even after he disclose his past is my choice. What he told me was, he really cherishes our relationship, and he is scared that I will leave him after he tells me the truth (especially since it's the beginning of the relationship and stakes were still pretty low). I thought it was really selfish of him to do that. Because it's really a fact right now that I'm 3 years invested in this relationship and the stakes are so high that I can't just walk away. I felt really angry because I FELT (personal opinion) he got exactly what he wanted and I'm really playing in the palm of his hand. Disclaimer, he is faithful to me and treats me really well now. He isn't cheating on me or visited prostitutes during our relationship. But I can't help but feel anger towards his selfishness.I know what some of you might say, let the past be the past. He isn't obliged to tell me, and a lot of guys actually have similar past but they don't usually tell their other half to ""protect"" the relationship, etc. So yes, I acknowledge that and I really appreciate him telling me the truth. But there's more to this story than the above, which made me question him/his values.Timeline: this was also during his early 20s when he was living his best life as described above. He has a brother who is very much older than him. Back then his bro was married to his wife (not sure how long they were married for, but they were together for at least 10 years). I am also not sure how the marriage spiralled, but there was once my bf and his bro went for a drink and his bro told him about how there might be something going on between him and his MARRIED female colleague. At that point in time when his bro told him, the cheating hasn't happened YET. But what really irked me was my bf's suggestion/advice to his bro. He told his bro something along the lines of ""if you're just itching, I have contacts for prostitutes. But DON'T ever start a relationship with your female colleague. She is married ffs"" (paraphrased). When he told me this, my mind was blown because he clearly thinks it's less of an issue when it comes to physical cheating vs emotional cheating (disclaimer: I get it that some people think physical and emotional cheating are different things altogether, but what I'm trying to drive at is that I PERSONALLY am against both physical and emotional cheating, hence the idea is more about my bf and my personal values are not aligned). He said in his defense, he currently thinks both physical and emotional cheating are equally bad. He was young and pretty drunk and he is aware now that his values were questionable back then. Anyway, his bro eventually cheated physically AND emotionally and the marriage broke apart. After introducing his bro to the world of prostitutes, his bro engage in such services frequently (after he and his wife divorced). Let's talk about temptation. Recently my bf and his bro were casually eating (and drinking) along the streets of Geylang, and his bro was itching. So he told my bf he's gonna find prostitute, and HAD THE AUDACITY to ask my bf if he wanted to go as well. Mind you, his bro is 100% aware of my existence and we literally hangout together (as a trio). I'm talking about going out for meals and even travelling together as a trio. More than anything, I really lost ALL respect for his bro and I simply do not want to have any interaction with him EVER. In my bf's defense (once again), he didn't agree to it/didn't cheat on me and was waiting outside the chicken coop instead. He also said his bro could be just joking when he asked him if he wanted to come along. Like if my bf were to agree to it, his bro would most probably question him if he was serious. But hey, this is a mystery we'll never unravel. My bf is all about giving his bro the benefit of doubt, but they are family after all, so you will surely side family no? Doesn't matter to me, I simply lost all respect for his bro as a person because he's got really questionable morals (to me, not my bf). It really got me thinking about how it's a vicious cycle of temptations. Back then he introduced his bro to the world of prostitutes and unknowingly enabled his ""physical"" cheating ways. Right now it circled back such that his bro could possibly and easily enable my bf to cheat, so my bf could possibly be more prone to cheating. I know I sound really paranoid and pathetic, but I really can't help thinking in this 0 to 100 way because my logical state of mind is failing me. I don't know how/what to think about this and I really need some advice/enlightenment (his selfishness, potential temptations, etc.) I'm also finding it really difficult to reconcile with the whole physical vs emotional cheating theory he mentioned back then. Although he regretted what he said, it still makes me question his innate values. It just kind of planted this seed of insecurity/doubt in me such that in the future if he ever itches, he can simply go about his philandering ways? Although he isn't cheating on me today, but what if he cheats on me a year later? 3 years later? 10 years later? The stakes are only going to get higher as time goes by. He says he won't cheat, but all guys say the same bs. I'm just thinking in the future, will I ever look back at my stupid self today for seeing the red flags but not acting on it by leaving this relationship just because he hasn't cheated YET. P.s. appreciate if you can give me some tips to deal with his bro in case we are ever forced to be in the same setting because I'm not going into the whole ""if your bro and I drop into the sea, who will you save first"" rabbit hole. Seriously, I wear my heart on my sleeve and I simply can't hide my disdain towards people I have no respect for.-#99395: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99395","['Like: 13 people', 'Haha: 5 people', 'Sad: 3 people']",47 comments,8 shares
99389,"I met this girl, a year older than me, online from an app about a few months in mid-May, we texted everyday and two weeks later, she wanted to meet me physically to which I agreed. But a few hours before she our meet up, she told me that she went to meet another guy from the same app and hung out for a few hours. Initially, I was a little puzzled as to why she told me that. So after talking for a couple of hours, she told me that she liked me and to be honest, I’m not sure if that’s a red flag because we only known each other for a couple of weeks and I barely know her and she just straight up tells me she like me like ‘ok….’, of course I didn’t really know how to respond and simply said, ‘I am interest in knowing you more’So she shared freely with me her past that she did a lot of things, physical intimacy with her ex (She knew him for about 2 and a half years) and they broke up because he kept calling her derogatory names, him being super clingy and would blame her for everything that went wrong in their relationship. On the days we hang out, many times she would mention about what she did with her ex and the things he liked and what not (Again, I was a little puzzle and confused as to why she kept sharing about her ex every time). She would also make those ‘uwu/anime girl sounds’ which to me sounded quite annoying and irritating. She would get angry at me over the small things like just changing the time we meet or when I’m just like for 5 minutes, she would blame and criticize me that ‘I am someone who cannot keep track of time’ or another time where I was visiting my grandmother, I told her that I can’t attend this event with her, and she just flared up. It was just the small things she would hold grudges and resentment. For our conversations everyday, she would talk to me about her work (I’m still studying in my 2nd year so I can’t really relate much to it) and rant about her bad her work is and stuff, and I offered some of my suggestions and opinions that could possibly help her but what I got was more ranting. Initially I was okay to hear about her rant for about a week or so but to hear about someone ranting every single day for the past two months, I felt quite uncomfortable about it. I would rather talk about something much more interesting and fruitful instead of hearing all these negative stuffs everyday just felt mentally draining from schoolwork. I really tried my best to help and support her during such periods but it just seems tougher by the week.For a few moments, she would talk about our future together (Keep in mind that we only knew each other for two months) So one day, I decided to let her know that we should stay friends as I didn’t want to hype up this whole thing only to let her down eventually or keep any expectation that she had going up. Furthermore, I personally don’t think I’m ready for a relationship (which probably what she was expecting) and I want to enjoy my singlehood for the time being. At first, she was upset and just gave me a cold shoulder reaction. Thinking back, I thought her being a year older than me, would garner somewhat a more mature response or understand the situation a lot better. Eventually, after letting her know my stand that we can remain friends but going further would be up to anyone’s guess. Our conversation everyday gradually became to a stop where she would make up small talk like ‘Oh look at what I’m eating’, ‘Look at this cat so funny haha’ everyday, personally I’m not really good at small talk so I could only respond so much like ‘LOL HAHAH LMAO’ and she just complained to my close friend that I’m ghosting her when the truth was that I’m not that interested in her but rather stick as friends and it feels like she’s pushing in the boundaries beyond my comfort zone. Our conversation went like this:Her: how are you doing?Me: Doing alright having a ton of school work and projects to submit, wbu?Her: Nvrm I don’t care alreadyThe whole thing just felt bizarre and weird and I tried to ask her what’s wrong but she didn’t really say much. Basically, she just felt like I’m ghosting her and ignoring her when the truth is that I’m just simply not that interested in her and just want to live my life. I suppose different wavelengths, different frequency.But the thing I have on my mind right now is that at times I feel like she’s having traits of her ex and just straight up blaming me for the smallest things and hold some form of grudge to use it against me which I felt was abit toxic, and that she has quite a lot of unsolved emotional baggage on her end and that she’s just dumping onto me, am I in the wrong to tell her my boundaries?-#99389: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99389","['Like: 9 people', 'Haha: 2 people', 'Care: 1 person']",16 comments,3 shares
