98702,"My boyfriend has a really really really hot female best friend. (AKA the girl that he tells me not to worry about)There was once, when he was in a gathering with his friends, his hot female bestie played and showed porn to everyone. There was no consent. My boyfriend felt extremely uncomfortable but he kept quiet as he was shy and didn’t dare to speak up. I was not present at the gathering.A little background of myself: I was diagnosed with PTSD last year. My trauma was related to sexual trauma.When I first found out about the porn incident from my boyfriend, I wasn’t affected yet as the triggers did not blow up back then. I shrugged the matter off.A few months later, my boyfriend started talking to me a lot about the vibrant sex life of his hot female bestie. Somehow, I just broke down immediately. I told him that she is really damn hot. I started to have flashbacks of the porn incident. Reflecting back on it, I felt damn uncomfortable. To me, when my partner watches porn with someone of the opposite gender, it is a crossing of boundaries. What’s more, he watched porn with the girl that he told me not to worry about. I was so afraid that my boyfriend may accidentally be turned on by his hot bestie, or fantasise about her.I started to have a lot of nightmares and flashbacks. The nightmares are uncomfortable to me as it’s about my boyfriend and his female bestie doing kinky sexual stuff together. Whenever I have such intrusive flashbacks and nightmares, I get so depressed and traumatised. I would cry the whole day. I lost all my self-confidence as well. At the same time, I felt super guilty for being affected by the porn incident only months after it occurred. I kept telling myself that “it’s his female bestie. Why should I worry? Why should I cry? It’s wrong to cry as it happened a while back.” I started blaming myself for being affected… after knowing that some ppl are okay with their partners watching porn with opposite gender friends.Is it wrong for me to be affected and cry only some time later? Is watching porn with friends normal and will you allow your partner to watch porn with ppl of opposite sex? Any advice?-#98702: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98702","['Like: 46 people', 'Care: 26 people', 'Haha: 25 people']",62 Comments,16 Shares

98700,"I am 37yr old male, married since the last 7yrs to my wife, who is a 36yr old female. We had met a year before our marriage and had hit ot off instantly. However, over the course of that year, we figured some negative sides about each other. To the extent that she was opposed to the marriage in the last 2 months. However, after family intervened and a lot of discussions, we went forward hoping for the best. Cut to the present - we have never had sexual intercourse ever. In the initial years she didn't want to, then I started losing interest because of her not showing any interest and now it looks like she has lost all interest in sex. We love each other a lot and care for each other. I have zero doubt that she is very very emotionally attached to me and cannot imagine life without me, and neither can I - hence separation is not an option at all. Very recently, she has started saying that we should slowly start to initiate our sexual journey - though, it has not been a stage where she is ready to go! Also, she doesn't like talking dirty or talking about sex stuff much - and I Love it. I have this wish to be a Dom to a Sub, which I used to hope my wife would be for me, but looks like all that is surely not a thing to happen in this lifetime. Given my situation, would it be wrong for me to long for an erotic massage just to let myself off? I am a strict no-no for any relationship at all, and I will Never want to cheat on my wife. But is getting an erotic massage cheating - specially in my situation? I see a lot of posts on other sites where people say how their sex life became better after attending a massage, etc. Given that I have zero idea about sex, maybe a massage session will open me up too? Or maybe it would just be a gateway to explore my fetishes?-#98700: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98700","['Like: 35 people', 'Haha: 28 people', 'Wow: 11 people']",92 Comments,20 Shares

So we decided to get together as we did discuss what marriage would be like as friends (eg if we married outside our faiths or race)And it happened to us There was one occasion where he asked me if I was embarrassed to be out with him, I was not but he felt it and I told him I wasn't Soon after we got married as our business was up and running and he finished his law school. However, he had won over my dad and mum although it was somewhat diffuclt  it's your life at the end of the day Yes we get second looks in SG and usually people comment within earshot of my husband or me in Mandarin and Malay ""Wah he lucky guy kids so cute wife so pretty ""And ""What a Chinese and a Indian guy ""The bad ones like ""wah can't find Chinese guy,disgraceful ""I just ignoreWe also have people coming up to us and saying wow how did yall do it...Why do I love him?Because he honours me and loves me a lot and he is great in all aspects and he always pushes me to be a better person.We moved to the United States to expand our business and we came back right before the pandemic as our kids are getting older. Also, i was in the same situation as the Op of the ""extreme mom"" confessor And yes my son followed his father's faith he chose it himself although he's only 7 years old.I'll end off with another e.gIn the 80s my auntie(mother's cousin) was also dating a Sikh guy however her parent's forced her to end it.She went through an unhappy marriage and he went overseas to work she got divorced and ended up with the guy she loved she's been married 32 years already.Stay strong friends .-#98696: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98696","['Like: 97 people', 'Care: 9 people']",4 Comments,5 Shares
98695,"Hey guys, 28 male. Back in uni I had a friend who wanted to be more than friends but I politely told her I wanted to focus on my studies and not into a relationship at the moment instead of me not being interested in her. But now she doesn’t even reply me. I’m single and have been meeting some girls on dating apps but usually nothing serious. Now and then, I’ll go online search for people to meet but the thing is I was kind of surprise when a guy text me asking if I’m open to meet him and enjoy. Feeling weird, he told me he wanted to blow me and doesn’t need a return.One thing led to another and now we are meeting once a week and he would just blow me and that’s all. He doesn’t need me to do anything, he likes what I have to offer. Initially I told myself I will stop after a few meet ups but I think I’m addicted to it too. While I feel it should end because it is wrong in a way but I just can’t cos he gets me high and always meeting my needs.Everyone have the urge to satisfy our needs but do you guys think I should stop? Right now, I’m single but I believe I would stop should I find a gf.Any advice on what I should do at this moment?

I read lots of books, I try so hard to improve but my writing skills are still stale and my grammar is nowhere good. I really want to write for a living for the rest of my life but if I'm not gonna improve then how am I going to survive as a writer?

The reason for the breakup was because he cheated on me, but instead of giving the other guy a chance, my ex surprised me by going to my parents, my sister, and friends and promised them that he will never cheat again and will love me forever. He also planned a surprise party and proposed to me in the presence of my friends and family. It was very touching, I forgave him and said yes.

98688,"Hi you guys, I'm the OP of #98630 - the one with the spoilt lights and wild mum. Thanks for all the comments. I considered moving out but I feel like it does not resolve the root of the issue? Plus she already made plans to shift in with me when she retires lol (and I agreed liao siaogao what was i thinking). Actually I enjoy my mum companionship a lot. But there are times she get so unbearable and abusive. Like for example when she's in a bad mood, she will start to pack the house. She pack the house is her problem lah, but then she will start yelling at my siblings and I. She will yell at me for putting my half-finished bubble tea cup on the kitchen table. Or scream and shout about the pack of unopened M&Ms I put on kitchen table. And then she will grab everything and throw it inside my room. And the ironic thing is, when it's her stuff she just ignore lol. We have a bottle of coconut water and a box of agar jelly on the kitchen table (they're both hers), still not kept at the right places. The point is, when she's in a foul mood she will kpkb everyone else's stuff.Things are not good even when she's in a great mood. She gets excited and slaps me (because wfh i sit next to her at the desk lol kns then i kena the most). But doesn't matter because since young she hit me like nobody business so this is small thing. It does get annoying lah, when I'm focusing and I suddenly get slapped. Sometimes, I get damn dulan when she does this. Then I yell at her. How to give in? Out of 10 times, I can give in 7 times. The other 3 times I sure hot one. When I was younger when my hell of a stupid and tiko father was around, she will force me to sit there and witness their fights. Few times it got super violent. You all dunno lah, even catch the cb vixen also she drag me along. Oh btw, my dad cheated and is out of the equation now. That fucker (oh god forgive my tongue, im so sick of this shit) let his fucking vixen text me and tried to befriend me lol. And that bitch sent me a link of a rolex watch. Walao damn cheena the taste. There are so many brands better than Rolex wtf? I'm the eldest child, so I understand there are certain unspoken obligations. Moving out or staying away from her is not a good solution lol so stop suggesting me that. It seems like the most I can do is to give in more?

98687,"This is like the pettiest rant but it’s one that has left me absolutely steaming so here goesI’m very particular about my “outside clothes” and “inside clothes”. Particular as it’s the pandemic I’m even more careful; if I’ve gone out and sat my ass somewhere I’ll go home, shower and change out of that pair of pants before I get on my bed or my sofa. My mother on the other hand, does not care at all, which I’m fine with for the most part except for my bed. Unfortunately she has a habit of using my bed stand phone charger and sitting on my bed (near my pillow) while she uses it, which infuriates me to not end coz seriously I DON’T KNOW WHERE SHE HAS SAT ON. She doesn’t even have the courtesy to just move my pillow away or to just take the charger and shift it somewhere else. No, it has to be her sitting on my bed, ass near my pillow while using my charger to charge her phone. I know this is petty and this isn’t the worst thing that can happen but…it really just pisses me off to no end. I can’t ban her from my room or using my things coz in her words, “this is my house, I am your mother” but…ARGH. Ok, rant over.

98685,"I’m a woman who found my husband late (at 32) and I just wanna say to all those 30-and-above who are looking for the right man, these things take time and it is okay to be single.I dated 2 guys before him and they weren’t right for me. Commitment was the main thing they, as well as many guys nowadays, lack. My definition of commitment is very simple, there needs to be an understanding that once you decide to be with someone, you will be faithful to them until you die. I don’t want to have to hear all this crap about having platonic female friends whom you hang out with more than you hang out with me, or liking and following Instababes. I’m old-fashioned that way. Once you’re with me, you commit to me and I commit to you, forever. Otherwise the whole marriage/relationship thing is pointless.My husband has had a crush on me since we were in JC. He did not have a single girlfriend since he confessed to me then. We got together at the age of 28, 10 years after our awkward encounter as teenagers. I wasn’t even in his class. We just had a mutual friend. After JC we didn’t speak for a couple of years until we bumped into each other in Europe. That was when I realized maybe we were really meant to be with each other. And then our mutual friend told me he has been asking about me every time they met for 10 whole years. No he didn’t reach out to me for 10 years, and he said because he didn’t want me to be uncomfortable because I was always with someone else.So far, he has been the best husband any girl could ever ask for. He lets me do whatever I want, he supports me, he spends time with me, he insists that he washes the dishes, he does laundry, he irons my work clothes, basically he just trusts and loves me completely. Every morning, the first thing he does when I wake up is he will gently kiss me on my shoulder. He has done that every day since we moved in together. I don’t know man. I just know I’m never leaving him.I think sometimes we marry the people we love and other times we love the people we marry. With my husband, I think I fall in love with him a little more every day I’m with him and now I’m completely obsessed with him. I can’t sleep without having him next to me, and every time I go on overseas work trips for just a few days I’d cry in my hotel room because I’d just miss him so much.If you don’t find someone good, don’t waste your time. But if someone good comes along, know that even if you don’t like him right away, there’s a chance you might be after a while.-#98685: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98685","['Like: 514 people', 'Love: 105 people', 'Care: 64 people']",57 Comments,103 Shares
98684,"Hi all, 21F here. About 4 months ago, I got to know this guy through one of my friends. Almost immediately, I have this huge crush for him after some interaction. I think I am not just attracted to his nice physique but also how he talks and carry himself. We kept in contact and chatted online and in person occasionally, until one day I can’t take it and just confessed to him. He was calm and he said he was flattered but wasn’t ready for a relationship as he wanted to focus on his life and studies. So I respected his decision but we kept on as friends, though my feelings never went away but I never brought the topic up again. That was until about a week ago when we were having a more heart to heart talk. He brought up about my previous confession and said that he has given some serious thought. He said that it’s not that he doesn’t have feelings for me but said that he didn’t really want to commit to a relationship and asked if it is okay that we become fwbs? Should I take up his offer? I was thinking that I can get close to him if we become fwb and hopefully he can get into a relationship with me some day.

98679,"I am feeling very lonely and feel really bad (I don't even know how to describe this feeling).This is a rant and duh, it is going to be very very negative. I suggest that you dont read this post.As a shy and introverted person in my early childhood, I have  always had problems making friends (even now). My appearance and background differs from the norm which made things much harder. As a means to an end, my way of avoiding alienation was to be nice and helpful to everyone. It also prevented me from getting bullied too much, especially when I was younger. In my mind, I was happy not getting bullied as much as before and I dont have to sit alone for recess. I continued this strategy throughout my life which in itself was a form of torture. The problem was that people would include me in their group because I brought value, was useful and helpful (studies, projects and sports). In reality, it is a struggle to connect with them and I never felt valued as a friend. When asked for an opinion, I used to give my opinion but it was constantly disregarded and sometimes, it would even result in conflict. Being the ""different"" guy, the rest of the group would be against me. After those experiences, my answers have been just ""anything"". As you may have guessed, all my friend circles that are purely guys. My experiences with girls have not exactly been great. I have always wanted to have a female friend. Not even talking about romantic relationships which by the way has been non-existent. Just looking for just good platonic friends. Whenever there are groups of guys and girls eating and happily chatting away, it made me feel really jelous. I did have girl class or school mates with whom I did projects with but most people just interact with me for the projects and then, nothing else. They would however, be good friends with my other guy friends. Then, it was uni time and I really hoped that people would be more mature. Hoped for a better friend circle in my faculty but it was the same crap all over again. I was in engine so again all guys. I was determined to change my future so I joined a CCA. There were both guys and girls and really hoped that I could make some awesome friends. The speech made by the president on the open session that the members will become as close as family made my hopes go up sky high. However, not many people interacted with me for the first few sessions and there were cliques starting to form. Tried joining some of the cliques but felt the resistance and awkwardness. In the end, just joined the other dudes were without any cliques because they joined late. Still positive, tried to make friends with them at least. They came in inconsistently so it was hard to be become close. I was still determined. As time went by, lesser people started to attend so there was no choice but to include me in their cliques. I did not let it go to waste. I would try to talk to everyone I met, be as genuine I could and be as positive as possible (be it guy or girl). The whole cca group dwindled down to a very small size. I kept going to the CCA despite the workload and even when there were only like 3 or 4 ppl turning up. Sometimes, people would not talk to me so I would take the initiative, approach them and talk. If it felt awkward, I would back off immediately or if the person seemed interested, then would try my best to have the best conversation possible. I was not making any close friends but the hope was that my effort would one day help me . Stayed in the CCA for about 1 year. There was not much progress. When everyone came into the room, they would sit beside people whom they want to interact with. That is just how it was. I would go in early but no one would sit with me. Only the last few people would sit beside me because there was just no space in other groups. Despite knowing everyone, it was extremely depressing to know that no one would want to sit with me unless the situation forced them into it. Then, it happened. We had an activity where we had to sit in a circle so everyone could see everyone else. The group was quite small. I was kind of ignored during the activity but that is still fine. Then, the activity was over but we still had some time so everyone was talking with each other. No one talked to me. I was so stunned. They know I was just there not interacting with anyone but no one cared. I was feeling tired that day so I did not initiate any conversation. For an hour, no one talked with me. I did not use my phone. I just sat there like a rock. When we went home, no one walked with me. I feel extremely terrible that day and even vomitted throughout the night. I stopped attending the CCA for a while. No one messaged me to ask at all. Although I was there through thick and thin for the CCA, no one bothered to message me. I already knew that members messaged each other so I dont see any reason why anyone wouldnt message me. One day, I saw the girl from my CCA walk past me in the canteen. She clearly saw me but did not even wave or try to acknowledge me. My heart sank so hard that it probably came out the other side of the world. I gave up trying and just focused on studies.I graduated and realised workplace is not exactly a place to make close friends. The environment is very different and when shit falls, it is every man for himself. It was the worst.I still meet up with sec classmates and uni mates but I feel that they are just asking me to come because I was already in the group. Some just call me to feel better because they know I am not doing well career wise despite being good at studies. I would say my work problems and they would be grinning away because they have higher pay and do not need to deal with terrible bosses. I dont meet up with my jc classmates because for some reason they stopped calling me out. However, I still know that they are in contact because they post pics on fb. The guys in my jc clique did not even invite me to their weddings but almost the whole class attended the wedding, even the girls and guys from other cliques.I feel as though I was never truly anyone's friend. I never felt valued or appreciated as a friend. I wish I was not born with this background or this appearance. I know I should be proud of my background but it has caused me nothing be pain and suffering. I have never been able to share my feelings and thoughts with anyone. I never felt confident of myself ever. I always feel as though I am not good enough to even be friends with these people. It is as if I have to put in so much effort just to be able to sit and eat with them. They do not need to put in any effort. They even insult me and say whatever they want. If I try to defend myself, I lose the circle and have to sit alone. So, I just had to tolerate and tolerate and tolerate and tolerate. I feel like shit. I feel like I am constantly chasing but no one actually reaching back out to me.These feelings have been affecting me alot, especially the CCA one. It has been affecting me mentally and I can see the results. My studies was affected. My career was affected. My fitness has been affected. I just feel so lonely and depressed.-#98679: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98679","['Care: 48 people', 'Like: 30 people', 'Sad: 12 people']",26 Comments,6 Shares
98677,"I have an abusive gf who gets disproportionally angry over the smallest things. Her temper tantrums will last upwards of over 3 days and will include a minimum 3 hour one-sided vicious rant at me. She is also in the habit of blocking my number whenever her temper tantrums kick in.We have been together for 3 years during which the abuse from her got much worse in the past 2 years. Recently in the past 2 months I have been telling her that she is really taking me for granted. The reason I say that is no matter how hurtful and spiteful her words are to me, I do not fight back and remain patient and nice to her, in the hopes that it will soften her anger. The sad thing is instead of her appreciating this, she will just double her efforts to yell at me and to hurt me further after seeing that I do not retaliate. She really drains my energy and my time.Today after she yelled at me and blocked me, I decided enough was enough and wrote an email telling her I wish to end our relationship.Is it normal to feel empty and perhaps even a sense of regret when one is leaving an abusive relationship?

98670,"People who workout, helpppp please. I used to be very active in going for spin class and running until WFH starts 100%. For the past 1 year, and somehow work just gets heavier and its hard to draw a line working day/night, since we’re all remote. 1 thing for sure, its just eat, work, sleep, everyday. I am not sure if I am having a burn-out or depression, but I have lost pretty much most of my desire to workout. It feels like a dread, and I have to pull myself to do it in order to keep myself healthy. I used to push myself very hard, even in spin classes to always take the front row so I can keep myself up, and half marathon is my usual run distance. Now, if I can drag my ass for classes, I will just go for corner position so I can time-out myself. When I run now, I feel so sluggish and weighted-down, and I can only do max 4km which is just 20% of my usual and I am out of gas. Its like i'm doing for the sake of it and I don’t find joy. I am worried because I don’t know what's happening and how do I find that fire back? For those who know or have encountered this, how do you restart your engine?

We have nice conversations and sometimes we laugh together. But, I see no future in us. I think I am more into the more muscular type of guys and at least drive. But last week, he did something totally unexpected. omg. You know the durian season is here and the people here are all nuts for this. He suggested we buy some durians and eat at my place. He then chose some durians himself. omg. I never knew he has these skills. He declined the opening of the fruit and insisted to open the fruit at home. woah. once at home, he displayed his opening and cutting skills.

98668,"Is it natural to be this indecisive and uncertain about one's future direction?I like research, and in the years after I graduated, I took on a research assistant job to prepare myself to do a PhD, and also to gauge if I truly like, and am able to handle the rigour that comes with it.Now, I am severely burnt out, and this is not because the work environment is demanding, but mostly because I can't formulate ideas without discussing with others, because I can't decide for myself which analysis is the best, because I doubt my writing skills...and all that spills into delays that eventually has me spent. I can no longer look at my work without blanking out and feeling inadequate anymore. I am probably the most unproductive staff. This is no way a researcher should be like - they can seek inputs from and work with others, but are very able to work independently. They try and fail a lot, but get back up most of the time. They are highly motivated by their curiousity, and this lets them be very perservering.I have concluded that maybe, I am just not suited for research as a lifelong career. I don't want my interest to be extinguished just like that.But these traits are also important in other areas, not just research. And without the skill sets/experience in other areas, sometimes, I wonder, would I be any different if I switched to another field? Am I just an incapable being that has little value to contribute to society and to myself? Do I need a break, or do I need to grow a spine?Some constructive advice on how to be less indecisive, and how to improve myself, would be greatly appreciated.-#98668: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98668","['Like: 21 people', 'Care: 10 people']",19 Comments,6 Shares

He cares for me and will go out of his way to buy me simple treats whenever I am feeling stressed due to my workload and commitments. Boy, he loves to have sex with me and I don’t mind his enthusiasm as I find it pretty cute and think of it as a time for bonding . His sex drive is pretty high( maybe about 3 times a week) and I try my best to accommodate him as long as I am able to finish my school tasks first. Sometimes when we are out on a date, he would ask for a quick one and we will just get the deed done in the toilet of a mall, it’s quite thrilling and we would be often starred at by strangers outside the handicap toilet when we are leaving.I have found out that he has a folder of obscene materials stored in his phone and it consist of leaks/video of women from school and I don’t know what to feel about it…I mean, I do understand that men have their tendencies and needs to satisfy. But I don’t really like to mentally picture my bf masturbating to other women. I have mentioned it to him casually and I have told him to record our acts together and masturbate to it  instead. I even sent him multiple videos of myself dressed like a little slut while masturbating and calling for his name but he would always delete my videos and tell me to stop doing it as he doesn’t want our videos to be leaked/ hacked.

At first, the wife was strongly against it but in the end as we insisted, I still sat beside him but he did not accompany me as he promised as he was so busy with other people and keep sticking with the bride.

98661,"The tech industry in Singapore and Computer Science is now at the top of the food chain and the forefront of development. It can be said that CS and Tech are the king of all jobs right now. Computing students have both the money and the power, they earn a lot and are generally respected by our society. This is just a small but true story to demonstrate why the tech industry is blooming:My younger brother (born 1995) have just graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering at NUS. However, instead of going for the traditional ME role, he self-taught everything about programming and software engineering, signed up for CS modules as his UEs, and worked remotely for a mid-tier American company for 2 years. He went to class in the morning and went online for only 3 - 4 hours every night to have his works done, earning an official net monthly salary of 3600 USD - or about 4800 SGD. But the main income actually comes from the freelance and commissioned outside projects - completing 1 to 2 of these every week and he could easily earn 9k - 10k SGD in total without paying any additional dollar of tax. After working for nearly 3 years, he now owns a car and a large condominium in Orchard.Almost every girl are infatuated whenever they hear about IT guys and software engineers. There is this girl studying oversea in Australia, coming back here in Singapore to work and was referred by her older sister to work at the same bank. For some unknown reasons, when my younger brother goes to that bank and doing some transactions, he got both the girl and her elder sister at the same time, and all three started to live with each other in my younger brother's condominium. The two sisters are hailed from a relatively wealthy and prestigious family, with the father being a university professor and the mother working as a civil servant for the government. When the parents first heard about the news of all three of them living together, they are quite angry and threaten to disown the two sisters. However, after hearing that my younger brother works in the tech industry, they completely changed their attitude towards him. They called and inquired him almost every week, giving him gifts and doing everything to push him to marry their precious daughters as quickly as possible, so as not to miss on the opportunity. My younger brother should have married the elder sister this month, but due to Covid-19 restrictions and some other issues, they have been delaying their wedding ceremony.-#98661: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98661","['Haha: 718 people', 'Like: 124 people']",266 Comments,311 Shares

98657,"I don’t understand why some people I know, who are from wealthy families, with the talent/resources to go to top schools like RI/RJC, and then to top universities, choose to come back to “work for their parents,” but really they just become managers of their parents’ accumulated wealth.I know at least 2 schoolmates from RJC who have taken this route. After RJC one of them went to Northwestern and the other to UPenn. They both studied topics related to politics and economics, and would have gotten excellent training for careers in the public service. I thought they were both heading in that direction. They were very smart, and were “big-picture” people. i.e their interests are rather LKY-esque, or Tharman-esque. 2-3 years ago, both of them came back to Singapore and both decided to work for their “family businesses.” At least that was what they told me. But I know for a fact that for at least one of them, their family no longer owned a business because they sold their business when we were in high school. What I’m guessing they have is probably a lot of money or assets to be managed. I feel like we have a lot of these people in Singapore. Families with very talented and well-prepared children who don’t feel the need to contribute to society. It is their prerogative, but sometimes I wonder how much talent is wasted when the descendants of well-resourced families are being hidden away in Bukit Timah, basically doing nothing.-#98657: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98657","['Like: 30 people', 'Haha: 19 people']",53 Comments,4 Shares

98653,"Hi, before i start, just know that this is a very long story so prepare your eyes. I’ve been reading some of the stories shared by other people here in this platform and it’s inspired me to write my own life experience here. I actually have this list that i tried to accomplish each month and one of them was to clear photos from my phone album. And this was just part of the “cleaning up” of the mess and toxic relationship that i was in, the other parts was unblocking people and just you know, not even having their names and profile appearing in my blocked list, just letting go of the memory and hurt go quietly and letting time take its course. I dont really know what i want to get out of this by sharing my story but here goes.So i met J on one of the dating app, when we first dated everything seems so smooth, he seems like a nice dude. I honestly cant rmb any good mmry we had then because its just clouded by all the bad ones. I know its too soon but i brought him to meet my family overseas also considering it was our second trip tgt. On that trip was when i found out the first cheating incident (yes you read it right, first and there were many more to come-and at this point i know some readers will be like “i stopped reading at the first cheating incident- this girl is plainly stupid”. yes youre not wrong and feel free to go, kthxbye) after i posted a photo of him on his wall with like a heart emoji. The nextmorning, one of his “friend” fb msg me and asked me how i was related to J. I told her I was his gf. She didnt know. Reader, are you still there? Brace yourselves for the next part ????So she told me, she met him, in a hotel room while she was visiting SG. This girl is Thai btw. Oh how J loves everything thai and siam dius. Lol. Anyway, my heart sunk to its deepest level when i heard that. I didnt want to believe it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt because heck this girl was not even local and not in SG, she could just be history. Plus not forgetting we were on a holiday in my hometown (im not thai) and didnt want to ruin the rest of the trip (but it was already ruined and so was the relationship, that was the start). The unwanted msg really broke me and i bawled my eyes that morning but he reassured me it was nothing, it was not real. I believed him After that trip, I wasnt the same anymore. It made me question all his words, actions and motives. Two months after that trip, i found out one of his grab booking destination was to one of the hotel in Lavender. I was, shattered. I msg the girl and asked her when she came over to SG. The grab booking matched the day when she was around. Lol and you know what was the funny part. I worked around the area where she was staying. So i confronted him again about it, he NEVER EVER admitted to the incident, so there was no apologies. But yet i stuck around :’( because you know love ? (!) and the hope that he will change to become a better man. He never did. But our toxic relationship lasted 4 years, with one break in between. After the first incident, i became more paranoid and kept asking him his whereabouts, calling him randomly and asking to on his location (i became a toxic person too tbh).At that point, i wasnt thinking anymore. I was just listening to my heart, pinning my hopes that he will change, if i just continued to be loyal to him and stay by his side no matter the shit he threw in our relationship.As i mentioned, it was the first but definitely not the last. There was so many incidents along the way that i discovered, the details are now sketchy as they have been shoved and buried to the ground (in my journey to healing). But definitely one of the most ever fucked up unimaginable, unforgivable and mind boggling acts that he did was betraying his own mother, going to all those sleazy places with his own blood father. How do i know this? I have seen and read the messages.I really cannot comprehend that part of how he can do this shenanigan to the woman who gave birth to him.. my heart breaks for aunty, so much. But i do not want to go into details with that. I just hope there is special place in hell for them for those kind of deeds.Anyway, coming to my conclusion. There was once where he told me along this line “All the guys are the same. You will still encounter the same type” I just want to tell him that NO i still do not believe in that, and just because you do and act in a certain way, you classify and conclude all men to be like that, just to make it seem normal and acceptable, hell fucking no, what you did and what you have done, will never ever be acceptable even if im the last person standing by this idea, i will vouch for it till the very end. You know why? I met this guy who is very sweet and gentle and he is there for me whenever i need him and he has shown me what a real gentleman should be like. So im really thankful and blessed you broke me into pieces that day for me to finally pack up and walk out that door and that relationship that very morning.

98652,"Here's a little story that I really need to get off my chest and hopefully get advice on...A little background on myself is I used to be the bubbly and happy-go-lucky figure among my friends and colleagues. I loved to keep myself occupied with motivational podcasts on a daily basis and be seen as motivated and energetic all the time. I am an extrovert (or was).These days, I'm just laying at home (unemployed), mentally torn, and struggling to make sense of what is to come.Well, the thing is, I have been emotionally scarred due to verbal abuse from my parents back during my primary and secondary school days. I often received criticisms, discouragement and got mocked by them when I share about my daily activities/achievements. Naturally, I turned to bottling things up from JC onwards which eventually took a toll on my mental and emotional health. And in fact, I barely remember my family having any constructive discussion on well-being or anything (be in about education, relationship, or finances)It doesn’t help that I was physically abused by my elder sibling since young which soured our relationship as we grew older.To make matters worse, I was admitted to IMH a few years ago and was diagnosed with a mental illness. Been in and out of hospital since then. This hasn’t been a surprise to me but I would have loved to avoid it. People around me assumed it was due to stress from uni which resulted in the episodes. Yet deep inside, I felt that it was a problem that had compounded since childhood and only exploded when it was too much to contain.I have my friends. But at the same time, I seldom reveal my emotional despair to others. I do not open up to people easily partly due to the strained experiences since childhood.  It has also affected my relationship with my previous partners as I couldn’t get comfortable with being vulnerable to them.At this point, everything is still taking a toll on my mental and emotional health. The current covid environment isn't helping because it feels so cold and lonely in my family with little interaction.I don’t really know what advice to seek but I think it would be beneficial to know how I can overcome the emotional scarring and how I can lead my life moving forward?-#98652: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98652","['Care: 15 people', 'Like: 4 people', 'Sad: 2 people']",11 Comments,1 Share

98630,"I need help on how to coexist with my mother in peace. I am NUS graduate, but low income earner. AKA can't move out (yet) and also BTO not ready. This morning, my mum broke my standing light that I need for work. Instead of admitting HER wrongdoing, she came to my room and told me ""orh hor you broke the light"". So I went outside to check. After checking, I knew immediately I wasn't the one who spoilt it. I told her that the light was spoilt because someone tried to spin it with force and didn't loosen the knob. But she would hear nothing of it. She just keep insisting that I was the one who spoilt it (Note: the light was fine after I used it until 7pm the night before!!). After a heated debate, she finally said that ""I just want to tilt the light back to the straight position and it broke"". Kanina so you broke it lah. Then why kp me early in the morning? Why must say I broke it cos I'm the one who keeps using it? Why am I always the target for her mental abuse and manipulation?Anyway my point is, I really hate how my mum ALWAYS tries to push the blame to me when shit happens. Every chance she gets, she throws me under the bus. I know she's my mum and all, but I also see lots of mums who are nurturing and loving towards their children. Why is my mum like this? How do I survive another few years living with her? My BTO won't be ready in another 4 years and I think I'm so done with her. Please don't kp me. More than 1 year I stay home dealing with her shit I am damn sick. Is there something I can do other than giving in to her? I been giving in since 20 years ago and I'm damn tired of everyone telling me to ""aiyo give in to your mum lah. your dad cheated she also upset. her work got stress also. she is a nice person."" eh fuck off please, nice to outsiders doesn't mean nice to her own child?

I don’t even care if I have children. I’m indifferent. I just want a guy whom I can spend time and grow old with. Been on several dates and I realize very few guys want commitment. I only had one relationship that failed because he cheated on me and justified it by claiming I’m too busy with my work. I have already tried my best to spend time with him but audit is a really tough job.

98623,"Possibly Aromantic/Asexual guy here.For the past 20+ years of my life, I never felt any connection or desire towards anybody , except to this girl that I got to know and had a nice connection with for quite some time.We are quite intimate and I was there for her throughout her ex-toxic relationship. I thought for sure that we had something going on. She was still pretty close to me even when she got out of her toxic relationship but she entered into another one before I had a chance to confess to her. I confessed to her anyway but got rejected because she said she wanted to try out her current relationship , but we remained friends.Her relationship was pretty shaky because she was the one who chased after the guy and from what I and our group of friends can tell, the guy was probably just stringing her along. Initially I was quite reluctant , but I was supportive and encouraged her to keep on trying even when they had fights and almost broke up.Fast forward a few months, I can see that it was clear that the guy is just playing with her and taking her for granted. I tried to intervene and made it clear that I dislike her current guy for basically taking her for granted and not giving her back as much as she gave him in that relationship. From this point onwards, everything went downhill and she gives me the cold shoulder, making it clear that if I cannot accept the boyfriend, she would not even be friends with me.The thing is, even till now, it is still pretty obvious that the guy is stringing her along with no concrete plans to be with her in the future , and she choose to live on in this dream of her, instead of actually talking it out with him to stop wasting time. I would be happy for her if her relationship happens to take a good turn and she ends up happily ever after, but with things going this way, I doubt the guy would stay with her for long.I would not mind waiting for her to be single again and try to chase after her, but in the mean time, what would be a good way to mend our relationship when I cannot stand the sight of her ""player"" boyfriend. Also, as mentioned, I am possibly asexual/aromantic , so I am not going to look  for another relationship to get over her anytime soon. I also have plenty of hobbies and a decent job , so I am actually fine/happy being single , had been doing that for the past over 2 decades.It just feels so wrong to see her trying so hard and sacrificing so much of her time and money to keep that guy around, and he barely does anything in return and possibly just pocketing her.-#98623: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98623","['Like: 10 people', 'Haha: 8 people', 'Care: 3 people']",24 Comments,2 Shares

He respects the boundaries I have set knowing that virginity means a lot to me. A lot of my friends told me that since he is a guy, he surely must be getting his needs satisfied elsewhere. I refused to believe them because he has always cared for me and been very nice to me. At times, I wanted him to take off his tshirt and feel my body against his naked chest. But he had politely declined saying that he will keep it for after marriage since he may get turned on. He told me that this way he can keep me as a virgin like what I wanted. Then one day, I stayed over his appartment and I was watching television while he was in his room on his bed. I decided to pop in. I saw him quickly hide something under the pillow. My heart skipped a beat. Was he cheating on me? Was he texting other girls?. He seemed very nervous and told me I should have knocked on the door. In any case I sat and we kissed and chat a little. He said he needed to go and get something to drink and led me to the living room. He asked me to wait there while he went to Starbucks.My mind was still curious. So I went to his bedroom and searched under the pillow and to my shock it was Kinohimitsu Bust Up Drink! And it was empty! ""Gosh! Dont tell me he is drinking that!"" I thought. I searched his room and found a carton of it. I also found fenugreek tablets. As if it was not enough I found a pump that makes those humps bigger. My heart sank. Now I understand why he had never taken off his tshirt even when swimming. He said he wants to respect that women are in the pool as well. Now I understand why he did not seem so thrilled when I wore a skimpy top at his place. He does seem a little bigger there. Don't tell me he looks the same up there as me?

98613,"I just have some problems about communication with my mother. Since young, my brothers and I were educated by dictatorship, it's just like my mum will keep forcing us to accept her words and opinions. Such as...when I wanted to study dentistry, she said no not because of the fees but she said it doesn't suit female as female are not skilled in this and that, besides only studying in India will make you to be a good doctor/dentists bla bla bla... or she will try to be very hard in forcing us to accept what she wants to do to make us accept her such as you see i don't do what others do , they are a lot more harsher than me... no matter how i try to immitate her and explain to her how you feel right now is exactly how i feel right now...but still she's still thinking she's right, but i feel very stressful. I have almost suffered from depression when I was studying in A levels just because she kept deducing me for not studying whenever I went home from dorm every weekends when i locked myself in my piano room to practise piano just because I was not only doing my A levels but also my LTCL exam, but I felt very bad just because she kept scolding and blaming me in this way just like I'm really lazy and not doing hard enough when she never noticed how hard i had been studying at school, after school every weekends, though i know she's just having lack of security...just because of her harsh views and opinions, everyone in my family have been compromising her for more than 10 to 20 years just because she can never give in no matter in life, in our education choice, in our life choices and a lot more... I do understand she's trying to be a good mother from the way she wants just because she lost her mother when she was born and she was trying to give us everything and anything she didn't able to get since young. I know she loves all her kids very much. I have to admit I can endure more insults, judges and bad words from others more than my peers. I do understand that she's just saying out however by repeating this everyday including what i buy and eat everyday just like parrot really makes me stressful...I told her many times can you please don't repeat everyday and I have remembered and i don't buy those food anymore just because you think it's not good to eat too frequent just because I really feel like her way of talking really makes me feel like blaming me for buying this and that and not taking care of myself well and i know she's just trying to express her care to me... but I really feel stressful whenever i try to talk to her well until I don't even know how to communicate correctly with her anymore. [Reason: I'm in Singapore while my parents are in Malaysia and I do share what i do and eat to them everyday so they know how I'm doing when they can't see me] However, what I care is also about my mental health. Sometimes, when i talk to her and whenever she sounds like educating me again ( though i know she is trying to give me care) those memories including how much i have endured and how i hurted myself in the past maybe now as well would make me more emotional and she will keep saying that I'm now against them...though I'm not...I feel like being kidnapped morally when she always tries to use how other kids won't do to their parents which makes me guilty until it will make me losing control by hurting myself (biting myself, crying for one whole day even weeks, and so on) when I am full of bad emotions. This really affects me a lot in making friends as well as how my friends treat me may also lead me to face such extreme emotion as well. I don't even feel like exposing to others as telling out is rather useless...it's like...i feel no one is standing on my side when I'm educated to compromise though i do understand expecting understanding is never possible. Besides, my mum will also blame me for being silly enough just because i hurted myself in the past...it's like depression doesn't exist in this world and it's impossible for mr to have depression which, in fact, nearly engulfed me. I can never forget those days when i hid in my room and cried and hurted myself in the past, and maybe occasionally for now. Everyone in my family including my aunts(my mum's sisters) my cousins(who grew up with her) and a lot more have been asking me to compromise her...just compromise her. This is how i have been educated to give in since young just to stop quarrelling at home and by just to be a giving person. However, I really cannot take it anymore...I do understand she's my mother who take cares me a lot...and i do understand as a kid, i should treat her well and follow her will. However, her illogical way of thinking and mindsets on judging me really makes me feel inferior as I don't even know how much effort should I do in order to get her satisfy... I do accept her point of view that competition will trigger us to work harder and stay stronger in work field, however, I don't think my mental is healthy. It's like ... I don't even know what can I do anymore... so what should I do?

I always felt as if i was walking on eggshells around them and I rly dread seeing them. My fiance's mother is very controlling regarding the way i dress and she doesn't like me wearing sleeveless clothings or denim shorts. To make things clear, my dressing is not provocative in any way and i dress quite similar to most girls you see in Singapore. There was once when i went over to their place after a gym sesh so i was in a tank top and shorts. To my horror, during dinner she casually commented on how my parents didn't raise me well because women are supposed to be traditional and conservative. I was rly furious that she spoke badly about my parents and wanted to retaliate but my fiance nudged me and told me to just let it go. Some boomers love to use traditionalism as a way to shove their opinions down people's throat, don't they?My in laws also have oppressive personalities. The father used to be a sign on army officer and I can tell that he had trained his children well to not talk back by citing filial piety, even when things seemed unreasonable. My friend told me that this is a sign of dictatorship within the family culture and i will have a hard time after marriage because my husband will not be able to defend me at all if there's any family conflicts. Dining out with them is the worst and sometimes they would arrange for dinner together only on the day itself. Due to the nature of my job, I have to meet clients and sometimes because of delays I would end up being late for the dinner. I find it rly hard to accept their double standards. For eg if dinner was set to be at 7pm and they arrive at 6.45pm and I get there at 6.55pm, I would be deemed late. If I cannot make it due to prior appointments with clients or friends/colleagues, I would have to put up with their cold attitude the next time I see them.I'm sure that I'm not the only one who finds their behavior toxic. While I rly love my fiance and don't want to back out on the marriage over this, I'm worried about what the future holds...-#98594: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98594","['Like: 56 people', 'Care: 35 people', 'Sad: 30 people']",137 Comments,26 Shares

98584,"To those who felt that you are at the stage if talking about settling down instead of breaking up with your boyfriend or girlfriend who doesn't seem to be the right one, trust me, it's never too late. It's better to break it off now instead of marrying the wrong one. I am a 过来人. I was 28 (F) when I broke off with my then bf of 3 years. We already talked about marriage, applied for BTO, planned for our future wedding dates, etc. Everyone thought that we will definitely get married one day. But others don't see what's really happening between us. He is a smart guy, with high paying job and constantly given praises by people around him. Basically he is like the Mr Perfect in everyone's eye. He was the one who chased me. When we first got together, we felt like we complement each other. Eventually, it started to become me chasing after his perfection. Like because he is this perfect, I need go be as perfect. And no, he didn't tell me it is ok to be who I am cause that's who he really loves, he expects me to be as perfect as him. He finds me watching drama, reading blogs all these as wasting my time away (PS: I only do it once I'm done with my work). He always talk on the phone about work and when I commented that I didnt get enough attention from him, he said at least he is doing something that earns money and not laze around. But I was in love. Afterall, he is the Mr Perfect and everyone tells me how I should not lose him. Then it started to take a toll on my mental health, crying to sleep everynight cause I felt like I was never good enough. I communicated the issues with him and he didn't feel like he has any wrong. Eventually, we decided to go on our separate ways, and gave up on our BTO. The rs was so painful that it took me 2 years to decide that I need to start opening my heart again. Went on some dates (dating app) and went on a few dates with those I thought we have chemistry when talking via app but ZERO chemistry when we met irl. At 33 years old, I met a guy via mutual friend. We hit off instantly. I really enjoyed talking to him. He is not perfect.. not well educated, earn less than me, slightly shorter than me, few years younger than me. To put it bluntly, people would say he ""pick until gold"" if I ever agree to be his gf. I shared with my friends that I was interested in him and none of my friends felt that we can work out cause he is too different from my previous Mr Perfect style. But I went ahead to agree to be his gf within one month after knowing him. And fast forward, I am 37 year old now. He proposed to me after we were together for only 3 months cause he felt like I am the one for him, just as how I also told him I felt like he is the one for me. We got married 10 months after getting together. We are going to celebrate our 3 years wedding anniversary soon and our first son came out just last year. Couples can be together for 10 years and still breakup while couples who are tgt for 10 days could meant for ever. Length of rs does not determine how successful the rs will be. It could be 10 years old quarrel or 10 months of working towards being one. So it is never too late to break up with the wrong one. I thought I was gonna be single for life but my soul mate appeared when I was no longer looking. It may be late but it's better than suffering all my life being with the wrong one. Don't ever decide your life based on society norms. Do what you think is best for you and your mental health. Ask yourself what makes you happy and do all the happy things when you are single. Share those happy moments when you meet your future soul mate down the road and eventually share more happy moments when you find the one.

98581,"After my many failed relationships, as a 29 year-old, I have come to a point in my life where the only trait I really hope for is loyalty. As a young NUS student, having had no relationship experience, I longed for the thrill of an exciting relationship, for a guy who would sweep me off my feet. My first boyfriend fit the description almost too well. He'd buy me chocolates when I'm on my period, flowers on my birthdays. He'd take me out on fancy dates, spending way more than I know he can afford; and he'd repeat to me how much he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. This carried on for months. But his infatuation with me soon faded, and he had been flirting with another girl for 3 months before I finally broke it off with him.I've had a total of 3 relationships, all of which ended in the same tragic way.Now that I'm almost 30, I realized that all I really want now is security. To have someone I can go home to every day, with whom I don't have to worry about how I dress, or how I speak, or how I behave. Someone who will always take my side. Someone who just listens to me without trying to change me. Someone who wouldn't get bored or sick of me even as I slowly age into an old woman. I want someone who is just there for me, all the time, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want someone who's willing to commit to be the lifelong partner for me as my dad has been to my mom.

And definitely, marriage is something we have discussed too. It is just not too soon as we are not really financially stable yet. However our view on having a child is different. I am not keen to have a child as the financial burden and commitment are huge. Given the society now, it is very hard to raise a child. My wish is to have a dog and live happily with my partner. I know some people have the thinking that a family is only complete with a child. But I think a marriage can be happy without a child too. On the other hand, my boyfriend wishes to have at least one as he feels a child signifies the bond and love between the two of us. This is something that has been troubling me as I know our ultimate goal has to be the same. My partner said he is ok to accommodate me but I do not want him to be unhappy too. What should I do? Should I give in and probably give a chance? On a side note, I do love kids a lot especially my nieces and nephews. I just feel being a mum requires a lot of commitments and I am not ready.

98571,"My bf of over a year (1 year and 3 months to be exact) had broken my trust due to him apologizing without changing his behavior almost a year into our rs when I opened up to him about how I felt neglected and not listened to. (Our 'conversations' consisted of practically just hellos and goodbyes, even during weekends. There were also a few instances where he just ignored me when I really wanted his reassurance, something that I have brought up before, although I understand he was busy with uni stuff, but when I asked him when it could be talked about, I just got ignored.)Long story short: I felt really neglected. Felt like he didn't care about me. Communicated my needs to him several times. He apologized and promised to change his behavior, nothing changed. I gave him lots of chances. Nothing changed. Trust in him is shattered. It hurt me a lot. I really wanted out. I told him that and gave him an ultimatum. He apologized for taking me for granted and told me he would make time for me etc., he begged me to give him one last chance. I gave him that chance. I'd say he's doing a little better, but part of me is scarred from the whole thing of giving him the chances in the past. It seems like worries, doubts and resentment had built up and I keep thinking why he didn't treat me better earlier on, why it had to result to me giving him an ultimatum before treating me better. To this day, I still keep on thinking what I am to him, even though he's treating me better, I don't think my trust in him has returned. I'm not sure if it can be restored to the way it was. It's like the ghost of the past, rather, the memories of the past keeps haunting me. How he treated me in the past replays in my mind, and whenever I remember it, I just cry. It really hurt a lot. People always equate trust to that of a shattered mirror, where regardless of how much you try to pierce it together, the cracks will always show. He said he's determined he will earn it back, and that he really wants and loves me, he's showing it in his actions, but I'm honestly scared that I'd get hurt like that again. It seems like I've been scarred. I'm not sure if I trust him. Yes, I love him a lot, but .. I'm not sure if I trust him, if he could earn back my trust, if our rs would to back to the way it was before he had broken my trust, if there will come a time when the doubts in my mind would clear up, when I would feel secure with him..Is it possible for someone to earn one's trust back when it's been thoroughly broken several times? Would there come a time when the doubts, the worries, the fog in my mind would clear up regarding why he took me for granted in the first place etc.?

98569,"Need some advice here.My bf and I have been together for  almost 2 years but he still doesn’t trust me. Before you go on to say that he doesn’t trust me because of something I did, no I didn’t cheat or do anything even close to cheating. Throughout the past 2 years, I have been 100% loyal to him. No odd messages or unnecessary one on one meet ups with the opp gender. He knows every single one of my friends (I usually keep to a small circle of friends) and I tell him everything. I meet him almost everyday and we video call (instead of voice call) so there is literally no secrets between us.Before him, I’ve had exes and serious dates and so I’m more sexually experienced than him even though he’s older than me. Is it reasonable for him to feel that I have the tendency to sleep around just because of that? I don’t. So now every time I go out to drink with my friends (which is prolly like once in 3 months), he gets all upset. I had drinks with my colleagues the other day and ended up vomiting because of excessive yakult. Yes, my yakult soju’s ratio was prolly 3 yakult to 1 soju. So I texted him “I vomited :(“He didn’t respond and only said “rest well b” the next morning. Turns out he got mad at me because of that vomiting saga and was having second thoughts about our bto plans. Wtff. I showed him the messages in my group chat where my colleagues apologised for leaving me to clean up alone because I was the only one conscious and yet he remained upset about me drinking. I do love him but I’m getting sick and tired of his insecurity. I feel like I have done everything to make a guy secure and Idk what more can I do to help the situation.

98555,"I am the OP of #98475I see alot of pp bashing me because i don't give mthly allowance and my mom waived off my tuition fee from her cpf. For context that i didn't see a need to elaborate (since it was just to explain to the original requestor the starting pt i was on), i wanted to pay off the lump sum tuition fee to my mom's CPF (i accumulated enough within a year) and for the first year i was providing allowance on a mthly basis (market rate). My mom however, feels that waiving off the amt in CPF and getting it in cash instead was better for her since she preferred cash and it would remove interest for me ( win win). In addition, she herself preferred the option that i saved the money and grow it such that i can pay for their subsequent hospital bills/home needs instead of a lump sum payment to them to spend as they wish.My parents refused when i wanted to get them insurance because they were adamant that its a ""scam"" despite me talking to them multiple times and getting agents to try and convince them. Also they have health issues which does not have insurance providing adequate coverage in their current age, as advised by the agents. Oh and why we have a bad relationship? Because my parents were physically abusive and i was hospitalised multiple times, yes, even when schooling. And yeaps, no allowances from them, i'm expected to earn it myself. In addition, the allowance i provided monthly was spent off gambling within a week ( yeaps the whole sum). Hence, after discussion with my mom, its best that i pay direct for what they need as and when they need it.So yes, get off your high horses and stop being salty. To those saying i have a headstart, woah, Nope i didn't. I worked throughout uni to support myself and minimise burden on my parents.So yea, less judgemental nonsense and more hustling instead. Maybe instead of trying to be keyboard warriors with an over inflated, over imaginative, salty mindset... it would be good to realise not everyone feels the need to go into details about their family dynamics. Since so many want to make assumptions, then i will clarify it and i hope, in your daily life, instead of choosing to bash others without the full story, do things more constructive instead and of course,More understanding, less judgey.

98553,"Is it normal to not be ready to enter a relationship? I'm already 30 years old this year. I admit that I have this deep suspicion that I'm gay. Whenever I see guys outside with good physiques and looks, my gaze would linger on just a bit longer to admire them. I sometimes do fantasize having a relationship with a guy, but that's about it. I simply can't imagine myself being in a relationship with anyone. At first I thought that it was my parents that I'm worried about. They are conventional, and would definitely not take it that easily when they find out that their son is sexually unconventional. This was what I thought impeded me from entering a relationship. Because I would rather die alone and single than to fake a relationship with a lady. It's just unfair for both of us, more for the lady. Yet gradually, I realised that I might be the reason why I'm not getting into a relationship. Sometimes I think that interacting with others can be tiring, but other times I find myself longing for companionship. It's this see saw type of feeling that makes me all the more confused. So am I this, or that? Do I want to commit to a relationship, or do I just yearn for one just for the sake of it? Here's what I did to test out myself. I sieved through my past experiences with my friends. What I found out was that most of the time, I'm reluctant to make the first conversation, take the first move, or propose something first. Also, I would become very uptight when I'm with someone, even with people I know well. It's like there is a control in me that is holding me captive, and I can only be my actual self in my own room at home. Even in front of my family, I would put on a semi facade, and only remove it once I'm in my own safe space. Yes, it gets tiring, but somehow I got used to it.

I have life and health insurance.Take home pay: ~$3500/monthMonthly expenses: $600 (self) + $600 (to parents)=$1200/monthDoes it make sense to allocate the rest of my salary:80% stocks 20%bondFor the stocks portion:$500- S&P500 (US MARKET)$500- VXUS (INTERNATIONAL MARKET)$800- NIKKO ATM STI (SG MARKET)I'm considering topping up CPF SA (about $500/month) as the bond portion for tax relief.I chose ETF for the stocks portion as they are well-diversified and I'm not familiar with how to pick individual stocks. My concern is that there are taxes (30%?) associated with investing in USD... does it make better sense to stick to SG market? Also, I am unsure what is the best platform to use for these transactions. Currently using online broker (moo moo/tiger) for S&P500 and VXUS, and OCBC BCIP for the Nikko ATM STI. I'm concerned if online broker is safe and cost-effective in the longterm.Finally, am I allocating too much of my budget to investment? Should I continue to save money in the bank for my short-term goals (next 8-10years) (house, car, etc).Please pardon my noob questions. I'm reluctant to talk with financial advisors as I always feel like they are trying to sell me their products... hence I turned to this platform.

98546,"To OP #98426: I guess I could share some advise/ experience as someone who has been in my family's company for a few yearsFor some context, I actually did not want to work in my family's business. But due to me not getting any offers, I felt I did not have a choice (my starting pay was average for a fresh graduate at the time). There will certainly be those that judge you for ""taking the easy way out"". But, at the end of the day, what matters is that you make the best choice for yourself. I count myself lucky that my closest friends understand and accept the decision I have made (they also do know some of the issues I have faced in my workplace, which leads them to be more understanding). I know it's hard. There are people who accuse me of flaunting privilege sometimes when I just talk about family. One of my largest reservations back when I was 25 was how I would be perceived for working in my family's company (I actually cried when I realised that I was going to be working in my family's company).Working in one's family company certainly has its perks. As you have alluded to, you would be exposed to management, a valuable skill whether you choose to stay on in your family's company or leave in the future (This is coming from someone who has contemplated leaving my family's company on several occasions, so never say never). You also get more exposed to different aspects of business, again something a regular employee would not get. On the other hand, the politics can really be a pain. Company politics has a completely different dynamic once family becomes involved. It's one the biggest reasons I have contemplated leaving my family's company.There can also be awkwardness between you and colleagues due to them knowing you are the boss's kid. I guess the simple advise I can give would be to treat everyone nicely and not ""flaunt privilege"". It was awkward between me and some colleagues initially; but things have improved significantly, with some sharing information with me that they would not share with the bosses.All in all, I do not regret joining my family's company. As mentioned earlier, there are those who would judge me. However, their opinions don't matter to me as I had made the best decision for me. As someone who does not understand the way your family/ family company works, it would not be appropriate for me to try and convince you which direction is better for you. All I would advise is tune out the noise and the judgement from those who don't matter and make the best decision for yourself. Hope this helps you. Wishing you all the best in whichever path you choose!-#98546: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98546",['Like: 11 people'],3 Comments,2 Shares

98544,"Ok i just need an avenue to speak and express some stuff. So far NUSWhispers has been a great place to do so. Some background, when i was younger my mom used to cane me a lot. Theres never a month that went by where i wouldnt get canned because i was either rude to my father or cause i did smt stupid in public. Its usually the former because my rs with dad was terrible, mostly due to my parents’ bad rs. I still preferred my mother more because i knew she was the breadwinner of my family. I know she felt bad for hitting me but she doesnt know how else to parent me. Once shes cooled down she usually buys me things like food i like. (This ended up with me now having very bad relationship with money, and fear of commitment to woman. I cant love properly) besides the point tho. So when i was 5/6, because of the cannings, i thought if my mom could do that to me, i could do that to anyone who irritated me right? No one told me i couldnt. So one day my helper didnt relent to one of my request for a small thing i wanted and i went to find my mom’s cane. I tried to hit her. I dont remember her being afraid of me and i just knew i was genuinely having fun because i thought my mom was having fun when she hit me. So i told my helper to go hide under the kitchen sink. I wanted to play hide and seek, while i was holding the cane. Idk why she didnt stop me because she was more than twice my size. I was a fat kid though but still. Its so screwed up that i, a kid forced a grown woman who is tryna make a living in a foreign country, under a sink, and threatened her with a cane because i learnt it from my mom. My helper didnt say anything to my parents. Next morning all her belongings were gone. She left the house in the middle of the night, went to the police, and my parents were apparently facing charges in court. On hindsight thank god she did what she did. She didnt hit me, and she left right away to the police. Had she said anything to my parents maybe they would have made her stay. Dont attack my parents cause they’re nice normal people just that they hit their kids to parent them. This was 18 almost 20 years ago. Im a grown man, tbh i still think im a teenager cause i still in uni, but still. Im confronted with this memory and i really feel terrible. Im disgusted.

98538,"Can I ask why some of you have such a big problem with inherited wealth?Are you against people owning more than 1 property (commercial or residential)? Or are you against people being given the right to gift their properties to whomever they please? What about cash? Are we against people being able to accumulate large sums of cash? Or are we against people being able to gift their accumulated cash to whomever they please?If we think about the typical employment arrangement. Your employer hires you (and pays you), because you provide some benefit to his objectives. Some people do not provide any benefit to their employer at all and yet they continue to be paid. Some jobs at companies can be eliminated entirely without much impact to the company's P&L, and yet they continue to exist. For whatever reason, society has deemed it acceptable (legal) for employers to keep non-performing workers employed. If we think about the typical sales and purchase arrangement. You agree to buy something, a good or a service, with varying degrees of knowledge of what benefit it'll actually give you. Sometimes you pay for a service or a product that you never use in your lifetime. Sometimes you buy a packet of cai fan and it goes bad on your kitchen counter. Sometimes you buy a packet of cai fan for 50% more money from one store when you could've gotten it cheaper if you had gone round the back at a hawker center. This willing-buyer willing-seller arrangement has been deemed acceptable, because by-and-large, society has deemed it necessary for people to be able to spend money as they please.When we talk about inheritance, it is a similar arrangement. You decide to bequeath your wealth to your children (or anyone other than your children), because they have provided some benefit (tangible or intangible) to you throughout your lifetime. For example, I have been an object of love to my parents. So, by the same logic that you buy a screen protector for your phone, my parents have justified their own actions in whatever way they have when they decide to bequeath their wealth to me.So my question is, why are people not against the right to get protection for their iPhones but are somehow against parents giving their children financial protection?-#98538: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98538","['Like: 15 people', 'Haha: 7 people']",21 Comments,3 Shares

98535,"I always admired people to whom science and math come naturally to them. I really love the physical sciences, but I've always been mediocre at them. I can watch documentaries about physics for hours and hours, or proof-writing lectures for hours and hours. I understand them perfectly when they are presented and explained to me, but whenever I am expected to do problems, to write proofs, I choke. I'm from a very wealthy family and I have had all the resources to be a great STEM student. I never succeeded. Oddly enough, I was always really good at the humanities. I was a HP student at both HCI and HCJC. I have a degree in Ethics, Politics, and Economics from Yale, and I'm currently doing a dual JD/MPA degree at Columbia. Law and public administration was never really my calling, but since I've always been good at these topics without much effort at all, I stuck to them just out of pragmatism. I've always put my mediocrity in STEM down to pure laziness. I am really lazy to a fault, which is probably a symptom of my having being born with a lot of privilege. For some reason, when it comes to history, or social studies, or politics, or economics, everything just comes naturally to me without much of any studying at all. It almost seems like I have an eidetic memory for readings in the social sciences, but I can't seem to replicate the same ability/aptitude that I have for the social sciences with STEM disciplines. As I grew older, I started to realize that my lack in aptitude in STEM cannot just be a manifestation of my lack in effort, but it must be because of my lack in intelligence. Even though I will be graduating soon, qualified as a lawyer and a public policymaker, I can't get over the fact that I could not for the life of me figure out how to do well in theoretical physics, in pure math, and in advanced computer science (even though I'm great at econometrics and data science).

98530,"Thoughts on professionals/ employees crying at work?I was recently visiting my elderly aunt who was hospitalised at one of our major public hospitals. We were chatting happily when all of a sudden there was a huge commotion at the opposite bed when one of the patients suddenly collapsed and became unconscious. The next thing I knew, a whole team of almost 10 people rushed in to attend to the patient with the alarms blaring throughout the hospital PA system about a ""Code Blue"" (which I later learned is called when patients collapse and need CPR).Fast forward about 1 hour later, the group of 8 (yes, I counted) slowly left the patient's side one by one. The poor husband only came towards the end of the hour and so did not even know what had happened. One of the junior doctors (very young, looks like just graduated) then stepped outside of the curtains to speak to him and to my shock, she only managed a few words then choked up and couldn't even deliver the news properly and proceeded to excuse herself (probably to cry) just like that... Everyone else was just stepping aside to pack up and left the husband there standing in confusion and shock. It took almost 10 minutes later until another more senior doctor, I think one of the professors, had to come in to help explain everything to the husband instead. His heartbreak I cannot even fathom.I don't doubt that working in the hospital is difficult. There are surely a lot of deaths out there. But I don't think it is right for medical PROFESSIONALS to put their own grief of losing their patient (whom they only see for a few hours at work everyday) above the families' (who are literal life and blood and whom they have known and loved from birth). How can you even think your loss is greater than the family's?  It puts the families in very uncomfortable situations in needing to ""comfort"" the crying doctor/ nurse instead, or in very confusing situations like the above, which is ridiculous. I suggest the hospitals should look into protocols to enforce that the more senior doctors  should be the ones updating families, and for more training of professionalism in this aspect. Grieving is natural and a part of life, but there is always a time and place for it, and I don't think any workplace (much less hospitals) should be it.-#98530: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98530","['Angry: 194 people', 'Like: 45 people']",136 Comments,49 Shares

98523,"Just a bit of a rant from someone new in NUS middle management.It's really frustrating because people are often coming and going. Really makes you think about the people with decades-long service awards, because they're either absolute troopers or people who know how to play the workplace politics game way too well. It's also really frustrating dealing with upper management, because they kind of just do what they want and you get dragged along for the ride. See, you don't really have a voice as a middle management person. You just do whatever ""upstairs"" tells you to do. I think it's kind of jarring that as staff we get also emails from UHC #AreYouOkay but then there's no actual avenue for anonymized feedback regarding various policies, projects and whatever else. We're not heard! We just go about from day to day doing whatever upstairs tells us to do even when it's frustrating or tedious or honestly tone-deaf. And whenever there's something that upper management wants to do, it will inevitably trickle down to middle management.Then there's students. Don't get me wrong, NUS students are generally really nice. I've received lots of really polite emails requesting for help. A few strange emails from less-than-nice personalities are normal, most of us take it as outliers. But NUS students can be quite intense, which in return puts pressure on us to do things, even more so when the pressure reaches ""upstairs"". The students are here to study, to achieve, to get the whole uni package completed before they graduate, and we totally get that and want to help them along. We want to offer more mods to allow people to fulfill their grad requirement too, but sometimes there's just a manpower crunch what with exoduses of academic staff and all... and in the end, what can we do but to respond to everyone apologizing for the lack of mods, and then try to ramp up hiring for acad staff. I personally don't want to throw a spanner in the works for the students, and honestly it's not the fault of the students to, because you all are here to do what you have to do. It's just the pressure that comes from it all, unfortunately, and I feel like in the role of middle management, you feel the brunt of it more than anyone else.Beyond the acad staff crunch, there's also an admin staff crunch. Like I said, people are always coming and going. And not everyone leaves behind a guide for their successor. I've had to learn so much on my own. It's been tough, but the pressure keeps mounting every day. And I slowly realise why everyone is always coming and going. Sometimes I think I want to leave too, but it's also not like I have a lot of options in the current state of our economy.Will NUS ever bring #AreYouOkay in to some form of reality, for both staff and students alike, or will it always be just a hashtag and a way of halfhearted wayang about how much they care?-#98523: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98523","['Like: 11 people', 'Sad: 2 people', 'Wow: 1 person']",4 Comments,0 Shares

I met my first ex a few years back and I have to say, he's a rather nice guy but his heart is unsettled for a committed relationship. He gets bored easily and less initiative once we got together. We broke up because he said that we will get into fights frequently, but in my perspective, which couple don't fight? Communication is key to compromise flaws and to work things out. Despite more sadness and heartbreaks, I felt much happier and truly in love because the fortunate thing was the person you like, likes you back too. Then, I met my second ex-boyfriend. Everyday, i thank God for blessing me a nearly perfect husband material. I was loved, and I loved him. We worked every single things out whenever there's obstacles. We were in sync. However, I don't feel as happy as I was. I had to be truthful to myself, probably he loved me more than I love him, while I loved my first ex more than he loves me. Because I didn't want to be unfair towards him, I initiated to break. I felt he deserves someone better sincerely. So here's the dilemma, to be with someone you love, or with someone who loves you more? I know relationship is more than just feelings, but also the willingness to work as one together in bills, babies, lifestyle etc. No doubt, first ex gives me so much lovely feelings even if should there be any issues or etc, I will gladly help in a heartbeat without hestitation. While the second ex, I know my life will be well taken care of, but I don't seem to be emotionally attracted to him and always had to find ways to make myself happy.

Personally i still don’t know if i want kids, but the main few reasons for wanting might be because i was raised in a family oriented household hence the influence so my parents would definitely be happy to have grandchildren (i know it shouldnt be the main reason), and also like they can accompany us and take care of us when we are old, and like a “feeling” of a complete family as it’s like the next stage of life to look forward to. My colleagues around me just became dads and from the way they talk about how they only sleep about 3-4 hours per night for the first year or so gets me really sian although it’s part and parcel. So, how do you know that you wanted kids when you were around my age? Some advice would be great please-#98518: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98518","['Like: 19 people', 'Care: 4 people']",46 Comments,2 Shares
98516,Just to get it off my mind.I am happy married with kids but recently I found myself having a huge crush on my kid's contact arts instructor. I cannot remember the last time feeling this way. The instructor is probably 8 years my junior. I was trying to brush it off but then had recurring dreams about him to the extent i feel shy seeing him in person. Although I love my spouse a lot but it is nice to feel this again.

98515,"Is it a red flag? I recently started seeing this guy and things have been going alright. He has mentioned on a few occasions that he’s pretty serious about the us. I am not sure if it’s because I have just gotten out of a long term relationship, but I feel like our conversations are pretty limited and would inadvertently end up sexual in nature. Likewise when I am with him, I often have this nagging feeling that “ it should be more than sex” cause that’s how our dates/conversations would go to. A few times, he has sent me screenshots of random Instagram female influencers saying they’re pretty/hot. And I wouldn’t really know how to respond. It makes me uncomfortable but I know I can’t control who he follows/ likes on Instagram especially since we have just started dated. I really don’t know what’s the meaning behind those screenshots he is sending? Is this even common for a bf to be sending these to their gf? Right now, I’m just a bit confused if I am reading too much into this situation. Am I over thinking things?

98512,"Didn't really want to post here but I'd just like to have some opinions, so here goes my story:  I'm currently in a relationship for about 1.5 years, me and my S/O do not really interact a lot on a day to day basis as we both have our work commitments, though we do meet up once or twice a week on a weekly basis. Here's the catch, whenever we meet, my S/O would just eat (be it me cooking or us tabao'ing food over) , sleep after that (literally, not cuddle) and I'll send her home for the day. Make no mistakes, I'm not saying that this is bad but our little interaction with each other has caused me to somewhat feel like the relationship is more of an obligation than an actual relationship, whereby when we do actually go out, little things like carrying my S/O's bag for him/her makes me feel like I'm being used.(Yes, I know, I'm not actually being used). The next twist in the story would be me having met another person. My interaction with this person was naturally more than my S/O because of what I mentioned above, and I came to realize that this person has really good habits (does chores filial), morals and upbringing (to the point where upon knowing that I'm attached, chose to distance ourselves despite me telling the person that I only treat him/her as a friend).  To add on, our interaction with each other made me feel a sense of happiness that I haven't felt in a long time, similar to how you feel when you laugh together with a crush.  Currently, I have two dilemma, the first would be what should I do with my current relationship. The second would be if what I feel about the new person is pure infatuation (or not) and whether I should try seeking something more from this person.

98509,"I want to understand why working for family businesses would be construed in our society as something to be embarrassed about. Are we that balls-deep in this idea of meritocracy that we don't realize that on some level, there is nothing truly meritocratic? This whole obsession with being ""self-made"" is driving a lot of people to make sub-optimal decision just because they want to demonstrate that they got to where they are with minimal involvement of nepotism. So let me ask you a simple question, would Lee Hsien Loong have been Prime Minister had his father been a 9-5 salesperson at Best Denki and not Lee Kuan Yew? Just mull that over for a bit. Everyone starts their lives at different levels of privilege. Whether you like it or not, very few success stories start at absolute zero. The question now is, how much do you want each newborn in society to start at equal footing? Even if you could make equal the amount of resources a child receives throughout his/her lifetime, genetics would still play an unimaginable role. My younger sister has a near-eidetic memory, for example, and she is a PSC scholar. I, on the other hand, barely graduated NUS and I'm working as a real estate agent while she may become a cabinet minister someday. Nobody got to where they are without nepotism. The fact that parents decide to care for their own children and not someone else's children is already a form of nepotism. The fact that some of us left to be independent after uni does not nullify our parents' contribution to our lives. The idea that someone else's parents continue to make contributions to their lives and yours don't does not nullify the fact that your parents would have also contributed more to your life than the parents of some other schmuck out there who is more successful than you are right now. The line drawn between when parental contribution is considered obligatory and when it is considered nepotism is as arbitrary as the idea that anyone can claim to be self-made. Nobody is self-made.I think we as a society should stop feeling jealous that some people are born to rich parents. We cannot solve this inequality without consciously encroaching on the freedom of anyone to do what they please with their wealth so we should stop making people feel bad for receiving wealth. We have all received wealth whether it's in the form of transfers from the government (which is other people's money first and foremost), or in the form of parental contribution. You are not ""better"" if you receive less of it. Lastly, don't even pretend that if your parents had $50 million in Orchard real estate you would turn it down if it were offered to you.

98501,"OP of #98454 here. I decided to give him one more chance aka one more date and fetch me from home and back afterwards. This time he drove law by law, so I was totally OK with it now. Its just that I noticed he yawned a few times while driving, so after arriving at the restaurant I decided it was my turn to ask if he was okay and use the opportunity to dig more bout his driving habits and history.He was forthcoming with me and confessed in me laughingly that he crashed twice in his first 2 years of his 7years of driving, and both times was in slow start stop jam type of traffic where he dozed off at the wheel because he was tired after work. He also explain that actually he is aiming for maximum fuel mileage. then he went into a needy technical rant how about speed/RPM is directly proportionate to the mileage so he is trying to go as fast as possible with as low an RPM as possible and avoid braking. (how true is this? Comments? for cerato 2020 model is 13.5km/l good?) Once he mentioned it I did some recalling of that first drive, he really didnt accelerate quickly and didnt brake much, he reached the 140-160km/h mark gradually and its then when, to maintain that speed, he rather keep changing lanes than brake and before entering the spiral, I don't even think he braked, he just gradually slowed down and entered at 70-80km/h and maintained it thru.The ride back was safe and lawful as well but again I caught him yawning a few times. During the ride he also told me that after our discussion the last time he was driving law by law now even without me. But now I'm like errrmmm would I rather he drive slow and risk falling asleep and crash or drive faster and dun crash due to the adrenaline hmmmmm. Also it would be kinda awkward of me now to rescind my words after my energetic objection the last time. Seriously though best solution is he sells his car, but I know thats impossible cos I know his job requires the car.

I have not managed to find similar roles for entry level like me, as my role is rather niche as it is usually tagged on to generalist roles (am in a somewhat specialist function btw).

98517,"Have seen some posts about local uni graduates looking down on those who came from private  universities. Although I graduated from a local university, I would say that my decision to enter one was more because my parents have the very same mindset and believe that I will not be able to find a job as easily if I did not graduate with a local uni degree. When in reality, private universities like SIM, Kaplan etc. offer a much shorter route and the endpoint is more or less similar - which is to get a degree. I have many friends who are of the same age as me but make a monthly income of around $800-$1000 more than I do even though they hold a private degree. That 2 year headstart that they get in their careers is worth more than the additional 2 years I spent in University, not to mention the extra school fees as well. A degree from SIM costs easily half as much as a local uni. And as times change, I can see that employers are also moving away from the stigma that local University graduates are better.-#98517: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98517","['Like: 21 people', 'Haha: 2 people']",0 Comments,3 Shares

Personally, I am very good at this kind of algo interviews as compared to those kind of behavioral interviews considering how socially inept I am. Its also better than asking trivia questions like do you know what is a 2 way TCP handshake or how does your OS prevent deadlocking. At least with algo, you can derive it from first principles. It is better than those build a twitter clone with XYZ tech stack within 24hours as it doesn't take up hours of your time and can be outsourced anyways if you know the right people. You also don't have to watch youtube tutorials to figure out how to use the tech stack required for the interview. Algorithmic based interviews are just the cleanest and most effective imo.However, I do acknowledge that the issue with algo interviews is that they can be grinded to an extent. If I were the interviewer, I would probably come up with unique algo questions you won't be able to find on leetcode and require actual ingenuity.

He has also been approached by a headhunter offering him a higher paid but more intensive job and he rejected as well.

After work, he just comes home to relax and play games, netflix etc while I see some of my friends around my age who are taking part time masters/ online courses or doing side hustles etc. Character wise, he has everything a girl can ask for in a partner- kind, caring, fillial, humorous and considerate. But his unambitious side is really what kept bugging me. Given his credentials- FCH, high IQ, good ppl skills and he can speak well professionally, I know he has the potential to achieve so much more.

Non stop for months… M did do and say something which confused me, such as being too caring to me like scolding me when I forgot to carry extra cash for food, not informing him this and that, never informed him when I go and eat alone at school, would be very sad when I ignored him,(especially a day when M bought me a waffle and I turned down, M looked super disappointed, then when I alerted, I gave him a drink and told him I bought purposely in the morning. M was happy and excited and happily introduced his friends to me and said we will all be very good friends in the future, which further confused me), initiating physical touch… and some flirty things in messages… which really made me feel confused and not knowing how to treat him…reason that made me super imbalanced is M explained to me M and L are just friends when I saw they both always together after some times…but then allowing L to put the a photo where they hold each other’s hands L profile picture on a messaging app while talking to me everyday… that made me feel really inferior…and L told me they aren’t couple as well… which made me feel more disrespected… cuz I confessed M said M  still want to be single… when i tried to put down my pride and be just like usual before we fought last time… I still got cold shoulder… it’s like I need to initiate then he bothers, but then he would constantly put on something on ig story just nice when I feel bad by deleting messages…(main reason is I really feel sad but don’t feel like giving myself stress as well by thinking about it),our mutual friend (L) also told me M treats L in the same way ( I mean very nice and over caring) as well, but L did tell me M made her misunderstand before as well… I know I’m not right in not respecting him for writing long essay which he doesn’t like as well…whenever I deleted messages and disappeared awhile just bcuz I need to settle my emotions for having my own space cuz I don’t want to be confused but then I would turn out to be he thought I was angry with him for not getting any responses from him bah… but I do feel like being utilised as a toy without any explanations and apology as well… including he would just put something on IG whenever I feel like being isolated which further confused me… though I’m not sure whether it’s for me…and imbalances whenever thinking back those days when M could throw his tantrum to me when M felt unhappy about me… but I would just keep quiet and swallow everything for years until those things really engulfed me and affecting me for almost 1 year… that’s why I decided to ask M about all these (cuz I was too shy to ask so I just put in long essays)… then ended up being scolded cuz he thought long essays from me troubled him and he’s enough…and ghosted me…(every time when something happens M would do this and it makes me more panic… it’s like he’s not willing to communicate, usually my others friends are ok with this and they would be straight, but this one…)but yet I still don’t know how should I do… am I too childish and irritating? Should I put down my pride again and send him what I think which would again hurt me again? Am I really wrong at taking old things that made me feel depressed even until affecting my life by asking him why( I am not blaming him or arguing who is wrong, it’s just a self reflection)?But… if to move on… I would always have a thought “ am I wrong?

98478,"Response to #98467:Additionally, I think the focus on just Oxbridge and the Ivy League is also rather misleading. There are public Ivies in the US, as well as schools like UCL, LSE, Warwick and Edinburgh in the UK that I will regard as miles ahead of NUS if not for the pedagogy then for the quality of its resources and alumni network. The University of California (at least the top campuses of Berkeley, UCLA, Davis, and San Diego), the University of Texas-Austin, the University of Michigan, the University of Wisconsin-Madison (which was mentioned in the original post), the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, the University of Virginia, are perhaps equal if not better than anything our local universities have to offer, particularly for any aspiring academic. Schools outside the Ivy League include the University of Chicago, Stanford, MIT, USC, Rice, Northwestern, Georgetown, NYU, these are all better than NUS/NTU/SMU. The reason why they are “better” could also be that MNCs are mostly American and to American companies, a degree from the University of Washington is often perceived as better than an NUS degree. I work for an American management consultancy, this is evident. Note that NUS still has a Nobel Prize record of 0, as well as 0s all across the board in various research accolades. Clearly anyone hoping for an academic career really shouldn’t believe NUS is going to provide you with the necessary resources to be world-class. NUS students with aspirations in research often aim to go to the US for graduate school.But I take your point that when Singaporeans say “private,” or “overseas,” they mean something else. But the word “private” shouldn’t even be used because it’s wrong.

Even for personal interests/hobbies, they are largely narrow in scope. The guys are all either meddling with stocks/crypto, watch football or NBA or play dota/call of duty. The girls are all instagramming food, or blogshopping for new clothes, or baking, or doing yoga/pilates. I feel like I have 80% coverage with my generalising statements...Foreign uni students have those silly hobbies as well. But those serve more as short distractions for them rather than take up the majority of time? Applies to singaporeans who went to foreign unis and foreigners who did their studies elsewhere. The ones in MIT/stanford are definitely hungrier in terms of entrepreneurship and/or pursuit of knowledge, despite their reputation as nerdy ""engineering"" schools compared to say Harvard. NUS/NTU engineering also very uninspiring and CMI. The few can-make-it engineering folks I know who knew that they can't rely on the school to teach foundations, went on to do coursera on their own. Even China universities, and I'm not even talking about the top ones, have strong engineering culture with many inter-universities competitions and all.I say this because I definitely belong to the ""local"" bunch for most of my life, but by virtue of my career route and a specific personal obsession which my local friends always poke fun at, I get to befriend people of a variety of backgrounds and know more interesting people and their respective countries.I would find it strange that #98422 would claim that people are favoring local uni grads rather than foreign uni grads.

98475,"To #98403I saved my first 100k by the age of 26, 200k by 28 and from there it snowballs, and likely will hit 500k before 32 yrs old. For context, i do not come from a rich family, on the contrary, we were poor. I pay in general for all of my hostel fees, allowances etc while studying, my mom waived off the amt she paid from CPF for my uni degree. I have been working since 23.I also do not give monthly allowances to my parents on basis that 1) We do not have a good relationship and i don't like how they treat me as a ATM 2) I give a lump sum of 1-2k per year to each of them at CNY, some amt on their birthday, and of course random treats 3) Understanding that if they need money for items like Renovation, hospital etc, i will pay for it as much as reasonable or i can (recently coughed up 10k for small painting works and doors for them)It is definitely doable, but it takes ALOT of hard work.For my main job, i job hopped and worked hard to get promoted to a manager after 4 years.I taught tuition part time after work or weekends and i clock almost 15-20 hrs extra per week on top of my regular work. And this boosts up my savings kitty for the third income stream.Once i hit 28, i decided to try investing aggressively as another passive income stream and the increases are exponential. Year on Year, my savings are substantially increasing and now, its comfortably 100+k a year. My lifestyle currently - I spend approx 1.5-2k a mth on expenses and pre-covid, i spend about 20k a year on travel/hobbies.My initial goal to myself was to get 200k by the age of 26. I failed to, obviously, but while i took it a little hard, i decided to slowly work towards it and hit it by the age of 28.It can seem daunting, but an advice to you. Don't compare too much as it may make you feel worse about yourself. My friends have made it known at times that they are salty about my life and envy it, hence being really sarcastic to me at times. Frankly, i feel a little sad about it but it's ok, i understand. Just set goals that are doable and slowly work towards it. But consistency is key. Play to your strengths, and be willing to go out of your comfort zone, and all will be good.More importantly, don't lose sight of the motivation to hit that goal. My motivation was that i never ever wanted to be so hungry again, or to ever sit there staring at something i really wanted but couldn't afford and also, i wanted to be prepared to support my parents in old age (they don't have insurance).

98468,"I used to have a ex who was very good to me, willing to splurge on me, treat me and my parents very well, treat me with love unconditionally but I had no feelings for him, I thought feelings are something that will fade over time or can be built upon. The only flaws that he has is that he is a little weird, he would usually fap himself and record it on his phone, previously talk to girls on dating apps very desperately when he was single and also walks around his own shop naked and videos it on his phone, also he likes to spend future money using credit cards and when he spends he is a very big spender, he will buy facial packages over 3k, go for staycations at W hotel, eat at Sentosa, rent sports car etc. He works for his family business and although his qualification is only a diploma holder, he has money to spend extravagantly bcos of his family’s wealth. I’ve tried to ask him to do other things and to improve himself in case his business fails one day but he refuses to improve since he already is comfortable with his golden spoon. Because of that, I left him and met my current husband. My current husband is worse, he has a lot of secrets that I didn’t know before I married him. He was the top sales and earning quite a lot when I knew him, very hardworking with a drive in life. But the only flaw is that his sexual drive is very high and he always forces me to do sexual things on him that I absolutely hate, but bcos I love him, I do it no matter how much I hate it. Fast forward, I got pregnant by him, and only realised that he was cheating on me way before I got pregnant. My parents are very traditional and forced me to marry him to keep the baby as I always wanted a baby and to settle down. I could not accept the cheating nor forgive him but bcos of the baby, i proceeded anyway. After marriage, I found out that he was also spending future money, often borrowing from friends family and loan sharks, and had this history since 10 years back. He also like to convince other people to invest with him (scammer) and has lost almost half a million of money that is not his and that he has to repay. His past history also shows that he likes to watch porn, and his google search shows that he has been to all those dirty massage place before. He has promised that he will change but keeps gaslighting me, habits are hard to change.I plan to divorce with him as my love for him is dying day by day being unappreciated by such a lousy guy. Sometimes, I regret breaking up with my ex and wonder if life would be different having a kid with someone I do not love but a comfortable life. But I would not do anything to change the fact that I love my child to the moon, and without my current husband, I would not have her. Bcos of that, he always threaten to take my kid away if ever we divorce. And he has never paid a single cent for the child expenses so far, only using his cpf for the delivery. Even for the wedding, it was paid by mostly my relatives side angbao. My family hates him to the core bcos he has borrowed money from me and my mum (around 20-40k) total but has paid only a little back. He has also been jobless for almost a year. Even still, I still see hope for him as he keeps lying to me. Recently I bto with him and to my surprise, got it. In the case if we divorce after 3 years, the house will be forfeited and my chances of getting a house next time will decrease. I’m thinking whether I should just tolerate and not talk to him and just treat him like a housemate and sell it after 5 years then divorce. But 5 years is a long time to tolerate and being gaslight or abuse by someone constantly, not being able to move on. He keeps asking me to see a psychiatrist, I feel like I have a slight issue but still can control my actions, after being abused for so long but I feel that his main motive is to make me prove that I’m mentally incapable of taking care of the child. My ex on the other hand bcos his parents divorce no longer has his golden spoon, has to find a job outside and rent his own flat (as I predicted). Was my decisions made wrong? I feel like it’s very hard for me to proceed on and be positive in life after going through so much in barely a year and my decision making process is often clouded with emotions. I hope someone can give me a right advice. What would u do if you are in my position? Bcos I really don’t know what to do anymore.. my husband is not contributing financially, and doesn’t even treat me nice now, and keeps asking for sex. He is only selfish and cares for his own needs.-#98468: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98468","['Like: 27 people', 'Sad: 16 people', 'Care: 13 people']",72 Comments,15 Shares
98467,"In response to #98422I believe this guy is misunderstanding something. When most normal Singaporeans refer to 'overseas universities' in comparison to NUS, they don't mean Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Oxbridge or whatever ivy our PSC/President Scholars are going to. Usually, they are talking about tier 2 overseas colleges which cater to the lesser people who were rejected by local universities and is going to such lesser overseas universities which are usually very expensive but unlike the true global elite universities, have somewhat subpar academic standards. From my personal experience coming from one of the so called 'elite' JC, in that environment, if you go to NUS or local universities, you are seen as kind of a failure, a person who cannot make it to the true elite ranks of Oxbridge or the Ivies. Personally, I still feel envy at my peers who is studying in those places while I am stuck here. I assure you, almost all Singaporeans know that those schools you mention are infinitely better than NUS. However, the Australian universities, or tier 2/3 US/UK colleges that people go to when NUS rejects them? Well, I think it is right to say, they really aren't the best. You mention the point of our ministers being educated in overseas colleges. This is true, but as I mentioned they went to the top elite global universities like Cambridge or Harvard, not some XXX State College. Also bear in mind that in the past, like 30-40 years ago when our ministers had their education, NUS was nowhere close to where it is today. To put it bluntly, it was a 3rd world university with 3rd world resources! A lot has changed since then and, if you see our parliament lineup as of late, the majority of the younger parliamentarians were from local universities like NUS or NTU.Lastly, I would like address the stigma of this private vs public university thing. Firstly, we cannot compare the situation in Singapore with the situation in USA. It is true that in the USA, their private universities are the best and most highly sought after. But that is due to their system and long history.  All the top private elite colleges have centuries of history and alumni funding. It is not easy to build a world class university in a matter of decades. The only reason why NUS/NTU are able try to compete is because they have a lot of backing and support by the government.  Do you think S*M or J*** C*** or whatever have that chance? Furthermore, even if they are offshoots of overseas colleges they are usually built with the incentive of raising funds for the parent college by relying on the brand name. Do you think that the UOL here is remotely close in standard as the UOL in the UK? Not even close! The cohorts are graded on 2 separate curves to begin with!So yes, I don't disagree with you that NUS is no where as good as the true big league overseas universities and I don't think anyone would disagree! Just that, I think you could be misunderstanding the divide over local vs overseas universities and what it really represents.-#98467: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98467",['Like: 23 people'],24 Comments,3 Shares

I realised ever since we started living together the sex has gone down dramatically. He’s no longer interested and doesn’t initiate, always saying he’s tired. But when we were dating he would still initiate (and last) even though he worked the entire day. Now I have to beg and even if we go at it, it’s probably less than 5 minutes. I can tell from his face he feels like it’s a chore whenever I ask for it. I have spoken to him about it a few times and it seems like he’s having issues staying erected (strangely no more morning wood as well) or he says he would rather just cuddle. Told him to see a doctor but he simply brushes me off every time.I also noticed these days he’s been looking at thirst traps on Instagram, something I never noticed when we were dating. I don’t know if it’s because he only just started, but either way I’m just feeling like I’m not enough, therefore the looking at the other girls with boobs and butts out and lack of interest towards sex with me.-#98455: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98455","['Like: 20 people', 'Haha: 10 people', 'Sad: 8 people']",30 Comments,5 Shares

I didn't not expect him to be a racer based on his demeanour. I also have a driver's license and I am the kind who is OK with driving 20 over the speed limit.

He also makes it look very casual and was doing it all one handed and talking to me at the same time while I'm like trying to play it cool. So it seems like he does this often and not trying to impress me. I think he noticed cos he asked if Im OK after we arrived at my place. So I told him I was not ok, that he was driving very recklessly. He apologies and assured me that he signaled and checked blindspot everytime and it was very safe. Then I told him even so I was not comfortable with it. He apologise again and said he will watch out next time.Now I'm thinking is his demeanour a facade? Cos on dates, he gives me the safe, polite, funny, and respectful nerdy feel, but his driving style signals to me that his risk appetite is big and dangerous.

98453,"To reply to the parent of the M3 going M4 NUS Student post on #98397.I saw your post on the matter of public interest. To give you my context, I am a doctor specialized in emergency and also from Singapore, also a grad from NUS Med. When the outbreak happened, I was practicing in US for my training.I was based in New York, when it was most badly affected. High positive cases, low on disposable equipment and PPE. Fast forward almost 2 years, I travelled back from US to see a very well controlled situation in Singapore, and then back to the States again to help out.Firstly to address your concerns, you had already mentioned the school made some preparations with regards to the exam, so why not trust the school to had already made their preparations?Secondly, students are already made to undergo a swab prior to their examinations, do take note I am absolutely sure that the staff (in this case doctors from hospital) are required to do so as well.No test are 100%, as you mentioned a higher sensitivity test. Currently perhaps the best option is the one that is being used, as you mentioned 80%. If there is 100% please do highlight to any relevant authorities, you may just do the community a great favor in advancing our testing capabilities.""I heard from my daughter that a lot of students gather at each other houses/school (legally of course) to practice physical examination techniques. I feel that this encourages social interaction and is putting our students at risk""Medical students are trained from school to always work in a team. This isn't a multidisciplinary world anymore, it's interdisciplinary. We are trained to work together with our colleagues (of various specialty and department ), other professionals (Our nursing, allied health & pharmacist) and even non medically trained (Porters, IT support, Administrative support, cleaners).There will always be social interaction, and there will always be risks involved. And I assume that even the cleaners in the hospital knows that too. You will never be a lone ranger in healthcare.  ""It is a little irresponsible for the school to carry on with the exam. There is really not much benefit for the school to hold this examination (also note that the result of the exam will not affect the promotion of students to year 4)""Every practicing opportunity will affect a future doctor's decision making, clinical judgment and mental preparation. This is to prepare your daughter as much as the school could provide prior to reaching houseman ship and being a Medical Officer subsequently. Oh and trust me when I say, no 1 standardize patient can adequately prepare a student enough to enter the realm of the sick. Being a doctor isn't just about results, if it was, none of us will wake up early to beat the clock, catch a glimpse of our 10 years aged face in the mirror due to stress, skip meals because we wanted to or had to. In this field, intelligence only moves you forward this much, it is about the desire and determination to keep going no matter how hard it gets, even if there is a pandemic. The journey of a medical student is a story shared by all, young or old, well-off or underprivilege, whatever the circumstances. Because your daughter's seniors had done it, so could she!  Although I am not a parent myself, I do understand your concern for your daughter and the general public. However I believe your daughter made the choice to enter Med school on her own accord, it will be disastrous to say because of a pandemic, I do not want to practice. In Italy, the country brought their M5 students in prior to graduation to help with the pandemic. While in Singapore, our  juniors (previously House Officer) were denied their post-graduate plans prior to entering the workforce. Won't such feat and tenacity inspire you as a parent to have faith in your daughter's ability and capabilities to practice as a future doctor while keeping herself and your family safe?No school will teach you how to manage a new problem popping up at Friday 6pm, nor how to handle pages/paperwork/computer system crashes. How to break the news to family members about their loved one's passing. How to deal with your first death, how to reach early, go home late. All these comes by experience, it comes by trying. While practicing back in Sg for a stint, my colleagues and I had to rent apartments to stay away from our parents for a month or so. We only connect with our families via video call or text. It was called being responsible, but it was taxing for our own mental health. Tenacity was what kept us going once again. In the States, when it first outbreak, we had to reuse our equipment, death toll was high, and I'm very sure everyone was scared, not only for our lives but for our families and loved ones. But the similarity both in Singapore and the States was the healthcare workers kept coming to work. Even the cleaners showed up in full force. Because we are fighting a war. You and your daughter both have a part to play and contribute. We do not need your applause at the window, we need your understanding. We need you to support your daughter because Med school isn't easy, and we need her help in the future. And the best thing you could provide for the healthcare system, is your full support for your daughter in completing her studies and to partake in her course.To your daughter, we need your tenacity, perseverance and future help as colleagues. Do not fear the pandemic, because the battle is still on-going, the schools are doing us a favor by ensuring that the future protectors received the proper training and skills to continue fighting this war, and other battles. So why be puzzled, be grateful instead that schools are still operational, the country is working together. I don't have free taxi rides to hospitals, nor people donating food via delivery riders to the hospital. The only delivery we received are our PPE stock, and that is enough to make the hospital smile. So be grateful that Singapore is fighting it together, however imperfect it is. I had once met an 78 year old cleaner aunty in Sg hospital, that greets everyone she sees with a jovial smile and good morning, at 6am during pandemic times, she is a perfect example of finding joy in service. So if your daughter is reading this as well, keep going, keep fighting, keep studying and remember to rest when you need to. Make good friends, and stay safe. Just like how we appreciate everyone who came back and help during the pandemic, we will appreciate you when you join us. We are far from the end, so working together to support our healthcare workers, including future colleagues, students will go a long way for our future.Disclaimer: all information is written to the best of my knowledge.

I broke off with my 5years long term relationship ex half a year ago as he was being mentally abusive to me, example if something doesn't goes his way he would shout at me although in his context he was just raising his voice. The relationship became very toxic and I decided to walk away from it as it was either break up or marriage if I were to continue staying on in this relationship. 4months after the breakup he had zero contact with me leaving me very much heartbroken as I was still very much in love with him. I tried moving on by going on dates and meeting friends constantly keeping my mind occupied but My parents being kpo and not yet over the fact we broken up as i never told them the bad things he does to me and thinking we are making a mistake decided to invite him over for a family gathering one day. Surprised that he agreed to come it was the first time in 2 months since we last spoken, we had a serious conversation and found out that both of us was not over but both was too scar to take a step forward to do anything.... emotions came pouring out both of us feeling vulnerable and alcohol to blame we spent the night together. But after that night I realised we can never be together as old scars will never heal and it would be a mistake a try again. A month later my friend decided to tell me about his feeling for me. He had been there for me since the last year of my relationship with my ex and In a way he was a shoulder I could cry on and always lent his ear for me to rant since whenever I want to complain about things to my ex or was upset he would tell me Im overreacting and just playing the pity card ????, still being with my ex I didn't think anything much of his action aside from him being a good friend. After thinking about it for awhile I decided to give it a go and just try out this relationship.. Overtime I grew to really loving him and loving the way he treats me although he doesn't have much compared to my ex but atleast he treats me well... when everything seems to be going well I was hit with a news that u was pregnant. And it was definitely my ex as I have yet to done it with him. I told him about it and instead of being mad or asking me to abort it he hugged me and told me everything is going to be alright and if I ever decide to keep it he will raise it with me like his own If I want to abort he will be with me throughout the whole process.  He asked whether do I want to tell my ex about it and what do I want to do.. part of me find that it's only right to tell him about this child yet a part of me thinks I shouldn't as I have no intention of raising it with him if I were to ever keep it, after all a child wouldn't just magically solve our problems. At the end of the day I decided to keep it with my boyfriend and to never let the child know about his real father but my plans got ruin when my ex found out about the kid and insist on marrying me and raising the child together saying it's his birth rights to do so as he is the biological father  and that things might change now he will change for me and the baby .. he wants to file a lawsuit if we don't agree and will do whatever legal means to gain rights over me and the child.  Am I doing the right thing for my child? Should the child really grow up with the biological parents ? Should I give him another chance for the sake of the child..... even if it means gambling my happiness away.  Saying my boyfriend can never give the child everything that he can as he is a lawyer with a high paying income and my boyfriend just earning an average income. The child will be better off being able to choose to go to any school he wants and go and expensive vacations having all the toys he desire in the world and not being held back just because mummy and daddy can't afford... with all this drama going on I'm slowly sinking into depression and thinking maybe I should just get rid of the problem... if the child is gone..all this problems will be gone.... What should I do? I really hate myself for thinking like that.....-#98445: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98445","['Like: 32 people', 'Care: 15 people', 'Wow: 10 people']",82 Comments,12 Shares

When my parents asked me when is the graduation ceremony and whether or not they can go for it...i told them soon. Deep down in my heart i felt like i should have told them that it became a virtual ceremony because of COVID. I knew they will be happy if they see me on stage although its just a ceremony because is something to be happy for them as we come from a low income family. I started working since i was 14 to work for my own allowances and pay for school fees. Its really a long journey for me and i know my parents know that i work really hard too.

98442,"To the guy behind #98346: i believe we are in the same situation and facing a scam. I've also matched with a guy on tinder and spoke for more than a month now. I've been on and off dating apps for years and thought ​finally there's someone that I could talk to for so long. I found it a little weird when he started introducing some investment trading thing. But for me, i never had interest so i brushed it off. Our convos went back to normal but somehow it will always go back to asking me to do it. He mentioned that it's for a better future and also at least we have a common thing that we are doing together. It's weird because there's so many things to do together so why he have to be so hung up on this. I took 2 days off talking to him and weighing out the different possibilites - whether this is a scam or not. My situation was more confusing because he wasn't using a business number and we actually spoke on the phone a few times. Decided to give myself closure by confronting him about this and tell him that i am not interested and i felt very pressured by him. I am okay to find out more and do it but not now when we are currently just internet pals. Why should i trust someone whom i dont even know in real life, especially since money is involved. Things sort of went back to normal but 2 days later, he brought it up again. I think it has been a little clearer to me now. Up till today, i have no idea how he looks like (only from his tinder pics), he doesn't seem to have any intentions of meeting up despite him being in SG. If he truly wants to date me as he claims, he would not force me to do this or at least will be okay to wait till i am comfortable enough. He was always patronizing in convos but i thought it was just guys being guys. But always more passionate and reply faster when talking about the investment shit. Even though up till now i still hope that he was real and genuinely wants to share something with me, but I think that confrontational talk was also a last chance that i gave myself to test him out. The girl in your case is not even in SG, so just continue keeping your guards real high. Don't download any scammy links they send, don't send the money. Don't do anything. 2 can play the game. If she is a real scammer, she won't be able to stay for long. Otherwise, just find someone else to talk to.

While doing so, I saw a lot of people talking about their toxic exes or their current toxic gf/bfs and I realised that I am like the toxic one. I get angry very easily, and while it is my own character and my own problem, I blame it on my mum because she has a horrible temper too, she is like the worst mother ever, everything even never off light also must shout and slam the door. Then there's me, whenever my bf does something I don't like or something doesn't go my way, even if it's my fault, I will scold him and twist things until become his fault. He always tell me to calm down and not to flare up so easily but I just can't seem to control my anger and put down my ego the moment I get irritated. I gaslight him, emotionally manipulate him and make him stressed, not proud of it, which is why I'm seeking advice from people (hopefully older people who can really give good advice on how to contain the anger and change for the better). Idw him to end up leaving me, but I don't like losing, he is a very patient person, but he hates to leave me alone to let me cool down. The moment we quarrel he will keep saying me until I even more angry. Sometimes I will just ignore his messages for hours and don't reply cos I feel it's the way I deal with my anger, the only way I won't say things I don't mean, but he will call me, spam messages until we fight again lolIs this a problem with just me?

Do some people assume that those who went to Oxford, or Cambridge, or Harvard, or Stanford, or MIT, or Yale, or Columbia, or Wharton, are inferior to NUS graduates? Why not ask McKinsey or Goldman what they think about the local v overseas divide? If NUS is so great then why are most of our ministers educated overseas? Incidentally, Lawrence Wong went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison and he might be our next PM. Maybe check where Kamala Harris and Joe Biden went to school?Why is there a “stigma” against “private” or “overseas” universities in general when schools like Harvard are obviously both private and overseas.

98421,"Hi everyone, I have some advice that I need. I am really at wits end on this matter.So I broke up 1 yr ago and now am single at 25.  I met someone recently and we clicked very well and are thinking of advancing. Both of us come from medium income family and only just started working in a non fix income job*. So the future is pretty uncertain. I’m fine with it because I was always the kind who who is willing to stand by my partner and build a future together but what my mum & best friend said made me a little worried.My mother and best friend kept saying that since I’m already 25, I should focus on finding someone by analysing them instead of letting feelings take front seat. And by that she meant to find someone who is richer. It is a luxury that im single at this age because I wont be blinded by young love. I do look at their character and all but somehow money isn’t my priority….Cos I had another guy who was interested in me and he, although just started working with not much money, he has a lot of potential inheritance from his parents and grandpArents (he is definitely getting the $$). However after going out with him previously I honestly do not like his habits and personality as a partner so I rejected him.My mum and best friend were disappointed in me. So I started reflecting on myself which is what I need advice on.Can I ask - am I too childish with my thinking? To want to build a future with a guy. That I don’t really judge if they are money “poor” at this point, that I believe with hardwork, one can always make it. Am I not being practical? Is there not enough time to build a future since im already 25 already? I’m really afraid of course that my partner doesn’t make it eventually…. ***and not that I rely entirely on him but I’ve heard so many divorces because it takes two people to raise a family.

98420,"Do girls find it off-putting that their partners seem like their not doing anything but the fact is that their business doesn’t require a lot of traditional “hard work?”I work for my parents. They basically manage a relatively large portfolio of assets (think in the low tens of millions), mostly in real estate. These assets generate revenue, and over time, they appreciate. This business will be passed on to me in its entirety because I’m the only child. There’s really not much grunt work required in this business. Most of the work is done by hired lawyers, bankers, and accountants. There is some work to be done when we buy or sell assets, there is work to be done when tenants come and go, but these things are irregular. On most weeks, I seem like I’m not doing anything. Which is true, I’m not doing anything on most days.My girlfriend gets very pissed at me, for some reason, mostly for “looking lazy.” She is a nurse and she works very long hours for a substantially lower income and she somehow hates that I’m not doing the same. We live together already and I do all the chores at home. My question is do most girls actually need to see that their partners look like they are doing something important? i.e fiddling with the computer, making phone calls, going to meetings. Or is financial stability ultimately adequate?

Sometimes when she throws some comments, other friends will step in to stop her from going further. Anyway I don't really know what is the point of making those comments... She obviously doesn't dress up and she really isn't pretty. I mean you gotta at least be of certain calibre to make comments about others right?

98404,"Hi, “I would like to share my story with my encounter with a (I believe he is a well known) sexual predator- mr IC.I have known IC for many years but just as a hi- Bye acquaintance. When my family and I moved to sentosa, we ran into him more. Therefore , he knows my family- my husband and my kids. I am working in  insurance industry in Singapore and in June 2020 , he said he will open and an account with me . He asked me to go over to his place, saying that his wife does not allow me him to go out. He has a 6 funny looking houses in south cove sentosa and stays in one. His family- wife and 4 kids stay in another house. He goes over back and forth between the houses. For the longest time, he has told me that his wife and him have problems and many issues. I told my husband of the problems IC faced and my husband and I usually told him- to take it easy. When he asked me to come over in June to sign the account opening, he grabbed my hand. I pulled my hand away and told him not to do that. He smiled sheepishly and then continued signing the account opening forms. There were only the 2 of us at his residence. After that incident, he would always stand near me, sit next to me, touch my shoulder. I had to do work so I had to still see him for account signing and proposal of ideas. I did not think much of it. As I believe naively since he knows my family, he won’t do me any harm. In December, when I had to go over , he locked the door and asked me to go up to the study room. He forced me to perform a sexual act on Him- a blowjob. I was too embarrassed and ashamed to tell anyone this- even my husband. Worse still, a few days later, I had ulcers at my private region and when I saw my gynecologist - she confirmed I have HSV1 . This pervert is well known to have STDs - hsv1 and hsv2  or maybe even worse.His ex wife “ Wendy “second wife has shared this with almost everyone she knows and therefore he has spread this to me knowingly that he would pass it to me. I would like to have this person exposed as I do not believe I’m the only victim and there must be many other ladies he has preyed on in leading them and trapping them .When I shared this incident with his wife, she did not seem surprised and as she knows her husband only too well. This man is a sexual predator and he should be stopped and hopefully the Authorities would stop men like these spreading diseases , breaking up families .

98399,"In response to #98303:I think I can talk about this from a guy's perspective (well actually just from my perspective, since clearly I can't speak for all guys).I think there are two possible reasons. The first is that they felt intimidated by you, like some of the comments suggested. However, I think the second reason is far more likely. It is that you are not conforming to expectations, and they felt that you were mocking them. Academic circles are extremely tightly knit, especially in the STEM fields. I've had casual conversations with professors/lecturers, and the were referring to their own PhD supervisors as their (academic) ""parents"", ""grandparents"", and collaborators as their ""brothers"" and ""sisters"". Studying for a PhD is like trying to join this family. Right now, you are a complete outsider to this family, and by asking very detailed questions on their work, it feels like you are trying to barge in and be adopted. You say that you know what you are talking about, but to them, you don't. Many of them have spent years working towards their area of interest (possibly gained interest in JC/poly, worked towards it in 4 years undergrad plus did some research projects along the way). You mentioned that you talked to 3 different guys doing engineering, quantum chemistry, and computing respectively. imo it is highly unlikely that you were able to match their knowledge in all of those areas.I've had a similar experience with someone recently. This person kept asking me highly technical questions (Mayer Vietoris Sequences) but it soon became clear from her responses that she didn't have the prerequisite knowledge (what is a normal subgroup?). She didn't know what she was talking about, but only pretended to know. It felt like she were trying to learn certain ""key words and key phrases"" just to impress me or something, and I was certainly not very impressed. To me, she sounded like ""that smart alec in class"" bragging about how they already know all the course material, but upon closer inspection, only knows things on a superficial level to look good. Younger me in my JC/Undergrad days would have been hit with a severe bout of imposter syndrome, but now I know how to keep myself together. These experiences are still very mentally draining and I don't want to be dating this sort of person long term.I wanted to ghost her right there right then, but decided to entertain my inner psychopath a bit more, by playing the same card back. I slowly steered the conversation to her interests and area of study, and away from mine. Then, I scrutinized everything they said, and asked highly specific questions about tiny details and technicalities. Needless to say, her tone became increasingly agitated and she got pissed off after a while. She then ghosted me shortly after.I probably sound like a freak right now, but I hope I have made my point clear.-#98399: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98399","['Like: 14 people', 'Haha: 6 people']",0 Comments,1 Share

98397,"Hi admin, please share this as I feel that this is a matter of public interest.I am disappointed and puzzled at how NUS medicine is approaching this pandemic.I am a parent of a year 3 going to year 4 medical student in NUS medicine. This coming Saturday, the cohort will be having a formative clinical examination (formative meaning the marks for the exam will not be included in the grade for the academic year). To provide a context, the clinical exam consists of medical students being in a room with a patient (in this exam, it would be a standardised patient i.e. sort of a ‘healthy’ actor) and an examiner (who is a doctor). Students are then rotate to different rooms in a round robin fashion.Granted, the school had made some preparations with regards to this exam.(1) Students will be split into smaller groups and are to report to multiple venues with no mingling. However, I am not certain if students of different reporting venues will be meeting the same patient/doctor. From my understanding, there might be a chance where students of different reporting venues will be meeting the same patient/doctor for the exam in their respective examination rooms. This mingling of students, standardised patients and doctors only creates room for a disaster to unfold. I am not sure if the doctors all belong to the same healthcare cluster. If they are not, the school is encouraging unnecessary mingling of the public with the hospitals. And if they are, they are also encouraging mingling of the public and that healthcare cluster. All this coupled with the emergence of new COVID clusters recently, will make us vulnerable to a potential new NUS/hospital COVID cluster.(2) Students are made to undergo a COVID swab, likely the antigen rapid tests (ART). This should be similar to the pre-event testing rolled out by MOH where people attending the examination are made to do a swab. According to a factsheet published by MOH on 20 Oct 2020, the ARTs minimally meet the WHO’s recommendation of at least 80% sensitivity. Meaning, they can only pick up at least 80% of individuals who are infected with COVID-19. As a non-medical pre-event testing, it should be sufficient. But for this clinical exam, where doctors from (possibly different) hospitals are involve (hospitals which houses sick patients and had a history of having a TTSH cluster), one would expect a higher sensitivity test.In addition, because of this exam, I heard from my daughter that a lot of students gather at each other houses/school (legally of course) to practice physical examination techniques. I feel that this encourages social interaction and is putting our students at risk.While I do understand why Singapore opened to Phase 3 HA as they had to prevent “many businesses to fold” as elaborated by Minister Lawrence Wong, I do not understand why the school is insisting on holding this big scale examination at this present moment when there are other opportune chances in the future when things get better (which is very possible given the rate we are vaccinating the population). Currently, even the government is “buying time to speed up vaccination programme”. If I may, it is a little irresponsible for the school to carry on with the exam. There is really not much benefit for the school to hold this examination (also note that the result of the exam will not affect the promotion of students to year 4). Offhand, other opportune time would be during recess week or at the end of the academic year during the students’ 14 weeklong elective.I hope more thought can be put when planning such big scale events.Disclaimer: all information is written to the best of my knowledge.

98396,"I have been together with my partner for about 6 years. We have plans to start a family together in the near future. One thing that is weighing on mind is my impression/liking of his family (or maybe just his parents) I would say overall they are still generally bearable since I don’t see them very often at the moment. But I am starting to picture how it would be like if I were to become their DIL. I try my best to smile and accommodate to them however ridiculous their actions are. For example, while we are eating, it suddenly becomes a food judging session whereby I am questioned about how the food tastes, how does it compare to other brands, discuss about the ingredients used (whether it’s good or bad quality) and having to state the reason for every answer I give. And if they dislike the food, they’d ask me to identify what the problem is even if I personally liked it. throughout the time when I see them, they would just bombard me with weird and uncomfortable questions. Basically, they are just questioning every decision I make be it clothing choice or food choice, it can be literally anything. They’d make me justify or explain why I feel a certain way about a topic or choose to eat a certain food. And if my answer doesn’t impress or meet their expectations, they would “counter attack” and it becomes like a debate LOL it’s really tiring if I have to deal with this frequently and my partner doesn’t voice anything as he respects his parents a lot.-#98396: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98396","['Like: 10 people', 'Sad: 2 people', 'Wow: 1 person']",27 Comments,5 Shares

During Father’s day, I did asked my parents while we were having dinner at home why they are still giving my pocket money and pack a meal for me. My father’s answer shocked me,“You are the only children for both of us, no matter how grown up you are, how much money that you gave to both of us, how good is the home that you bought for all of us and stayed together, you are still a child to us.

(Friends had to private their IG & hide their stories from him as well)•In the later part of our relationship, he even controlled the time I get to spend with my family. • I can never be late to meeting him, which means I can never sleep in on a weekend. I had to set an alarm for 9am whenever we were meeting, while he would still be asleep till 3pm. Still he gave me shit whenever I turn up past 12 noon. • A date would turn into staying at home, playing games and sex. • He would go through my phone in secret and confront me whenever he did not like what he read. • He would always arrive late and leave early at my family gathering, but I was not allowed that privileges at his family gathering. • Whenever he leaves my family gathering, I was expected to leave as well. • Towards the end of our relationship, whenever we were on dates - he would be on his phone all the time. Barely any interaction. Still that was my fault?!?!?• He would question my decision to relocate overseas and gave me shit for doing so. • He would ask his mom for it money when he’s broke. (He was 22 and still did that, yikes.)• Used Find My Friends to track my location when I was overseas. Basically I was to be at home or at Uni, anywhere else he would call and text me demanding to know the reason why. If I were to switch it off, threats would come in. • I would self-harm from time to time, just cause it was taking a toll on me emotionally. Initially, he felt guilt and changed his attitude towards me. But, he would used it as a ammunition and blackmail me into doing things for him otherwise he would snitch on me. You see this?• Also, he tried to propose to see if I would ditch a bright future and stay with him and be a slave to him• Then asked if I wanna BTO with him, and his parents will pay the downpayment as a gift.Decided to finally dump his ass cause he went full on crazy and blocked me on various messaging app, cause I fell asleep while browsing facebook and could not reply to his messages. I did message him back, but he blocked me and the message did not went through lel. Dumbass.

They were so excited over the food and one even said it's her favourite dish. I bought 4 live sri lankan crabs home and waited for my friends to arrive before processing them because I wanted to keep the food fresh.When my friends came, they were shocked that I bought live crabs. I told them it's for freshness. The friend who said chilli crab was her favourite dish started arguing with me, calling me a murderer.I told her to look away and proceeded to kill the crabs swiftly with a knife up the bottom and she started crying. My other friends were split, with one supporting her and saying I'm a monster, while the other said I am just doing what every restaurant does.I called her a hypocrite for eating crabs at a restaurant even though she can't stand the crabs being killed, and she couldn't come out with a proper reply. Needless to say the gathering sucked and she ran home crying with one other friend. This left the 2 of us to eat 4 crabs and it was absolutely delicious.Animal cruelty starts at the dinner table and I admit I am cruel to animals for the sake of food.

I brought card games so that things won't be so boring and she just said it's ok (with a very uninterested tone), before ignoring me coldly and used her phone and texted all day long makes me feel even more helpless and angry.. Our interactions are quite limited throughout the 3 days and it was damn awkward so much so that I have thoughts of leaving her alone in the hotel not more than once.

I thought of having the both of us having a hot and great shower together vanished no matter how much I plead and I am stuck outside the bathroom until she is done.We slept on 2 separate beds and I wanted to combine the 2 beds into 1 by pushing the beds together so that we can be closer.

In this day and age, we would like to have freedom of speech and choice.Please stop cornering us with ""Can we take your babies? Can we come to see them anytime?""We understand your need to helicopter your precious son. Please understand that your grandkids are OUR kids and we would love to raise them ourselves in a certain way, much like how you guys raised your kids in your own ways. Your son is not perfect and neither am I, but we will try our utmost best to pass down the good morals and habits to our kids. Remember, its our kids now, its our time now, its not yours anymore. Your son has grown up and he has his own quirks and bad habits, he has his own personality and preferences and temper. He may be terrible at cleaning up after himself, but thats because you pick up after him all the time. I am not perfect either, but when we become parents, we will find our own ways. You can give us advice, but do so at moderation, and tell us in a way we can accept, rather than ""i will help you do laundry, iron my son's work shirts, and clean your house"". No. I will not allow you because the same way I want him to learn, i want my children to have discipline and learn that the world does not fall by their feet. I want my children to learn, not to be indulgent and lazy, and to not take my traits of stubbornness too. I understand I have faults, and your son will correct then from your grandkids, not you. It is our time, yours have passed. Its time for you to take a step back.To all mothers-in-law, regardless of how good you think your son is, it is very rude to be condescending to us. We get that you gave up your youth and possibly job to take care of him, but in this current landscape and economy, its hard for one of us to quit to be a homemaker. We understand your son earns more than us, but it is not right to insult us that we can't do work or earn much just because your son works longer hours. It is not only rude, it hurts our feelings. We have a difficult time at work and we are here to see your son, we try to respect you and have you around to include you too, but its too rude for you to say all these condescending words. We understand we are not your children so our achievements mean nothing in comparison to your son, but bear in mind, if your son chose to marry us, your grandkids will have our genes too. To all mothers in law, can we remind you that your son is a fully grown adult. He knows how to take care of himself without you around. You don't have to keep reminding us how to do things the way you did, or whether you know his body best because you took care of him the whole time, because he is an adult and he will be the father to my kids. He has to set a good example and be the role model to my children, and I wouldn't want my children to wonder and develop any complexes due to your over-smothering and over-helicopter parenting style. I also do not have the time and energy to clean, cook, give birth, do everything for my children and treat your son like my 1st born manchild. He is a grown ass man, stop it, its embarrassing.All in all, all daughters in law in the world will respect you, as long as you give them basic human respect too. We are also our own parents' princesses, and we are also someone's daughter. Same as what you have experienced, we want things to be different. Afterall, it is a different era and time. Its time for you to take a step back and let go. They always say married ladies have no home, it is true because if we are wronged by our in laws, we can't go back to our own parents too. Afterall, we are married. Why can't this apply to your son? Even in birds and other animals, building a means we both leave our nest to build a new home by ourselves. Marriage means we form a nuclear family, and its me and him starting one. Please give us your blessings and cut the invisible umbilical cord. He will after all grow up to be a man, a father, a grandfather and of course, a husband. He is your son, but he is much more roles to our family. Similarly, by right I will enter your family, so if you could respect everyone else, why must you treat me differently with harsh words?I will treat you like my own mother, sharing with you what I have, my troubles, my happiness and joy, as long as you acknowledge that we are also human beings. We want our own life, freedom, and own right to build our own family. And for that, to all mothers in law in the world, we daughters in law will be grateful.-#98367: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98367","['Like: 156 people', 'Care: 37 people', 'Love: 15 people']",40 Comments,33 Shares

I always thought I have enough time to find ""the one"" and I don't really want to just enter into a casual relationship with no marriage in sight. So I've been rejecting a few guys that tries to approach me. A big part of me ""rejecting"" all the guys in the past is because I wasn’t ready to accept just “any” guy in fear I would get laughed at due to all the eyes in my family and the people around me. There's an immense pressure to find one that is of the same family background, same faith, same upbringing and at the same time; mature, decent looking and matches me. Growing up I want to say I've been fairly comfortable; certainly not spoilt, because we were trained to do a lot of chores despite having multiple maids and drivers. But I believe this is a big reason why it's been so difficult for me to find one that ""matches"" me in material terms and also as a partner that I could relate to, much like soul mate. I’ve always had too many “criteria” for a guy and the pressure from my family to watch me settle for someone lesser than me drives away any wishful thought for relationship. I'm really not sure how else to go on with searching for a relationship because there’s basically no options for me anymore, at my age, with no guys chasing me, and with very little relationship experience.-#98364: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98364","['Haha: 16 people', 'Like: 13 people', 'Care: 3 people']",44 Comments,4 Shares

98355,"This is in respond to #98293I am a girl but I totally feel you. I have read the comments on your confession and I truly don’t understand the people who analysed and accused you to be self cantered. It’s a description of himself, of course he uses “I”, I am sure his friends would agree that those are his personality and characteristic. As a girl, with all the girls’ talks and looking at a lot of friends around me getting into serious relationships and marriages, I do see some patterns. Good looking and fun man definitely are attractive, gives an edge to be less “nice” and is still sort after. Girls often like to say they are looking for sincerity/ effort which is really just the man being generous, romantic, kind in words. Long term relationship, childhood lover aside, a lot more relationship only become stable because the man consistently shows sincerity, effort, and generosity. For sincere good man, courtship/ dating is about having an eye for people and luck for it to happen. Have an eye to see if there’s chance or none at all. Put in all the effort, sincerity and pray that they reap outcomes.For sincere good women, I hope that I could say the same, but apparently don’t be too nice, guard yourself. Man have to do the courtship. That’s the only way to filter out man who would be nice to you in long run and not for the moment. This aligns with traditional and religious POV. My views may provoke man who feel the burden in having to show effort. That just means we have different views. Good luck on finding yourself a girlfriend who doesn’t mind no courtship.

98353,"I think it was a Tuesday. Right after lectures, I went to Clementi NTUC to buy a drink. That was when I saw him. Tall and slender, with black-framed glasses and a boyish haircut, there he was in an NUS Computing t-shirt. I had never seen him before. Yet, it was like a million magnets were pulling me closer to him. This was unlike anything I have ever felt before or since. I wanted to go up and say hi, but I was shy. I had to try damn hard to stop smiling; it was fucking ridiculous. I went to the cup noodles aisle to get my lunch before I went back to campus. I tried to concentrate on what I needed to get but I was so distracted by him.""Excuse me,"" a voice said from behind. Oh shit no it was him. What do I do now? I panicked internally until he said, ""Do you know how much this one costs? I want to get that but the price thing in front looks like it's spoilt."" He pointed to the green cup in my hand. I think I said something like, ""Uhm, It's 1.50."" He took 2 of those and said thanks. It felt like an important crossroads in my life where I could have made a different decision. Perhaps we would have had a connection. But I didn't and here I am today writing this post to thousands hoping that he would be one of them. I just wanted to let you know that hey, I think you're pretty cute.-#98353: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98353","['Like: 28 people', 'Haha: 23 people', 'Care: 6 people']",14 Comments,3 Shares

98346,"Went onto Tinder for fun without much expectations. I think I have a nice personality (typical nice guy), but I’m not exactly attractive nor good at conversations, hence my doubts on my own success over TinderAnyway, matched with a really pretty lady very quickly on my first night of using, whom I thought was quite out of my league based on appearance. She’s not from the SEA region, and not entirely chinese speaking, just to eliminate your stereotype countries. Our conversations are still ongoing albeit slow, but all these while, I kept wondering if it was some sort of elaborate scam or if there was some hidden agenda. Mainly because I kept thinking if this match was too good to be true. We spoke a lot on the digital market, and she shared her successful experience and encouraged me to get started. I was slowly picking up abit of knowledge on my own and was already planning do so in the future, so it wasn’t hard to convince me about how lucrative it was. There wasn’t any hard sell from her but throughout, I was extremely wary, like just to protect myself if it actually turned out to be some sort of financial scam. Which might actually also explain this match. We exchanged contact (she initiated), but I don’t think it was her personal number. I’m fine if it isn’t, as I totally believe it’s for her own safety. But at the same time, am unsure if it was a red flag. It was a business account too. So anyway I’m in a really confused stage. Large part of me is hoping something can develop so I’m still trying to put in effort,  but another large part of me is raising my shields really really high.(I believe in long distance, so I’m not writing it off so quickly based on location) And me being me, my thoughts brought this further to wonder if I do seriously have some trust issues, and if I’m destined to just screw up any future possible relationships.-#98346: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98346","['Haha: 17 people', 'Like: 14 people']",41 Comments,6 Shares

98347,"[A story about my father]I grew up in a broken family - my mother divorced with my father when my sister and I were 10 & 8years old respectively. My mother was seeing someone else then and had remarried shortly after the divorce. We were often told and taught by our paternal grandmother to tell the judge@the family court about our wish to follow our father should there be a need to go through court trial. But guess what, we don't have to go through our worse fear as a child of choosing between mother or father as our mother give up on us (at least we were told this way through our growing years). You must be wondering what has that got to do with my father, and on this special day? My father who is a person of few words has not spoken a bad word about my mother all these years. Taking care of 2 daughters as a single dad is not easy. With the absence of a wife to look after the children while you were away for work, my grandmother were rope in to care for us on a more permanent basis.Financially, we weren't doing well as my father was neither highly educated nor having a high paying job. Out of goodwill, my grandmother did not expect much from him and accept the child allowance he could afford.To make matter worse, with the increasingly amount of freedom cum loneliness, my dad made an unwise decision to mix with bad company whom introduced him to drugs. He started to default the child allowance and often asked my grandmother for money. Many times, my grandmother just give in to him (reluctantly) as those were his savings she claimed. As true as Karma is a bitch, my dad was soon arrested and imprisoned for a few years due to drug abuse offence. All these happens within a 2years period while I felt so distraught as I've yet come to terms of the parents divorce yet have to face with the idea of my absence father. As a result, our relationship got more distant. During his time of imprisonment, my grandmother will bring us to the prison to visit him. A few years has passed and he was imprisoned another time for contraband cigarettes related offence. The second time I was slightly less affected than the first time he went in.  Moving forward to recent years, he seems to have changed for the better. On thing I saw was he started contributing to the household expenses although he wasn't earning much as a free-lancer. There are times we still quarrel over finances especially during COVID-19 period when his job was affected. During then, my married sister and I provide him with some ad-hoc contribution but at some point I felt that he should at least made an attempt to look for a more stable job instead of being too dependent on us who are low income earners. The pandemic also made us realized the need to plan ahead financially. Thank goodness my father has a 3room flat which has been vacant for awhile. Every time I suggested he rents out, he seems dismissive but the economic downtown indeed serve as a wake up call for him such that he decided to rent out the unit. With his rental income and free-lance income, I can finally be less worry about him. Over the years, we also grow slightly closer than before as I saw he's trying to help out the household expenses although I still struggle with flashbacks from the bitter past. I am thankful I have other family members I can look up to, peer and religious support these years which I can seek advise from when I'm feeling lost. Often, we heard the saying that ""we can't choose our parents but we can decide on the future we want"". Today, I still stand by that saying and hope to take this chance to encourage those with similar pasts that you can live better than your yesterday. Alas, I want to wish all fathers of the pasts, current and future - Happy father's day ~ and thank you for the big and small sacrifices you've made and systemically impacting us in the community.

I mean compared to me (I graduated from NUS) and my peers, I really just can’t helped but to wonder how a private U student was able to get in, I’m sure many would too. So anyway long story short, I asked if she could refer me but she sort of indirectly rejected that idea. I was thinking is it because I graduated from a school better than hers, she selfishly rejected helping me assuming I could find a job since I’m from a local U?? I don’t understand why is it so hard to just refer a friend to the same company, everybody wins no?

98335,"I love being a pharmacist. I love serving my patients dedicatedly. I enjoy seeing them get well or empowered to take care of themselves. I believe pharmacists are able to help support doctors better  and do a lot more for our patients by humbly learning in our course of work from the doctors and patients, continuously enriching ourselves by going for Masters, Pharm D, National Collaborative Prescribing Course. While those bright sparks of pharmacy have achieved a lot and share the pride and passion of pharmacy, they are the rare fews blessed with good mentors, opportunities and being in the profession at the right time while they dedicated their time to do what many others did too. The majority are not that lucky. After a decade of work and freely “volunteering” my time while being grossly underpaid yet trying to be idealistic and believe one does not need to be overly rich because that cost will translate to higher healthcare costs, should I accept it that my institution does not value a decade of work experience as compared to a fresh pharmacist? The salary of a fresh grad is so much better than someone in the system for ten with more experience experience. While the ten year pharmacist is able to serve patients better and often gets compliments from the patients for the good care they received, the institutions believe this is EXPECTED of a pharmacist day-to-day work and hence does not justify a promotion or pay rise. While doctors get pay increment for every formal education they received, it does not work so for a pharmacist. The university promotes pharmacy as a course. The national pharmacy landscape paints an ideal picture of so much things pharmacy can improve. Yet, on the ground, everyday the Pharmacy managers tell their staff the things they do are redundant because it is not money generating. The staff is spending too much time when the reality is the staff is expected to make things happen with so little resources and expected to make the impossible happen. At the end of the day, the pharmacy managers say all these efforts are day to day efforts, insufficient to promote or get a pay rise. When you see the truth and ask to spend time not doing there work considered redundant by the administrators and ask what will get you promoted or given a pay rise, no strong answer is given. Because, the truth is, as a pharmacist, all you need to do is ensure timely and safe supply of medicines. It is that basic. Counseling is additional. Time spent with patient is not money generating to the pharmacy but a cost incurred to the pharmacy. The work is truly mundane and perhaps redundant as the administrators say it. So, to the young ones out there, if you can still U-turn, choose a different profession. Things will not get better unless society acknowledges and is willing to pay for a pharmacists’ service like in other countries. In the mean time, we are just a bunch of useful but free resource to be exploited. Can any strongly passionate person not be jaded after being abused by the never improving system for so long ? Share if you know of any organizations who treat and value their pharmacy staff better.-#98335: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98335","['Like: 5 people', 'Care: 2 people', 'Sad: 1 person']",1 Comment,1 Share
98332,"This is in response to post #98230. Warning, it is a long post ahead.Firstly, I am appalled by the comments. OP, please please do not be disheartened when you read through the many negative comments. I don’t think the situation you are in is one that many can relate to. More importantly I think many might be misunderstanding on real problem here.The issue at hand is that you feel pent up and resentment. You’re doing your best you can at securing a well-paying job despite juggling the young children and managing the household. It is an unfair situation because your husband, who is earning a similar amount, get his hands off the kids and household. Love aside, marriage is a partnership. It is not about making equal contributations because everyone have different strengths and weaknesses. It’s about both parties making similar levels of effort in maintaining and growing the family, it’s the comradeship of going through tough times together that is held by the core vision of the couple to want to work through the obstacles in life together. But, it’s not there because of your husband’s lack of interest in the family and the bigger picture. (Sorry to say this but it sounds like your husband is not very mature even in his 30s. That’s ok - mine isn’t too, but I still love him to bits till today after decades of married life together)If your partner is not involved with household and children management, one can only pray that he/she is more successful career-wise. Why? Not because the family needs more money and not doing well financially (OP has clearly stated - why are commenters still harping on this?) If you are OP and overwhelmed with handling everything, would you feel more sad if this was because (1) partner working hard to support family, long working hours and cannot help out, or too stressed and tired so need to unwind with videos, OR (2) partner is plainly refusing to help out because he prioritizes his me-time over the family, and the wife’s physical and emotional well-being. The first situation would render much more fairness to OP’s situation, right?To commenters who ask OP to delegate child-related duties to the husband: you probably won’t understand how it’s like until you are in the situation. Yes you can tell your husband to do specific chores, and he probably will do them. But you might only be able to delegate him a few things that he can do properly. More importantly, every time you need to ask him to help, it is  saddening. Because he is more pre-occupied with his own interests (in other words, does not prioritize his family), he cannot see for himself what needs to be done and what the wife needs help in. And OP, from your post, I can tell that you are a capable lady. You probably have been able to manage things on your own since the beginning; which could be why your husband didn’t get into right mindset and became how he is like today. You can try to remind him that every little thing in the house that he chooses to ignore, has to be done by you (unless you have helper lah). Tell him that you’re not coping and you NEED his help. If he still has some love for you more than his videos (and has any bit of ego), trust me, this will help him to take more initiative. But this increased involvement would be out of love for you - I would think that since he is inherently not very family oriented or inclined, this part is hard to change lah.Oh yes, please do not expect your husband to be able to become more ambitious or family-oriented. As much as how that would solve everything, it is just not possible. My husband was just like yours, OP. I hated him during the dark days because I felt unfair at our uneven contributions to the family and at the same time, battered by the holy trinity of full-time work, household chores and managing kids. I tried to imagine if a divorce would be the solution. It was a plausible option because after a divorce, the actual work I had to do was the same, but one less “child” to take care of and most importantly, I will be free of the emotional burden of having to deal with the pent-up resentment. But I did not go ahead with a divorce, because I could foresee a ridiculous situation in which as a divorcee, I would still date my ex-husband. Our love was still there. Or rather, I didn’t resent him strongly enough to overpower the love. But this was in my personal situation, may not be applicable to others’ situations. You might want to ask yourself whether you love him enough to still hold on, and whether he loves you enough to continue turning a blind eye to your needs.OP, hang in there because things will get better. Your time will be yours again when your children are older and less physically needy. By then, child-related duties are easier so your husband might be able to help you out better. You will find back the time and energy to do things you once love once your kids go to school. Chances are, your resentment for your husband will fade with time on its own without any action on anyone’s end. When you get older, you might just want to relax with your partner and enjoy life instead. Question is whether deep down, you still want to have this future with him? And is this enough to help you pull through the dark times that you are facing right now?Auntie wishes you the best, OP. You are doing well, and you are allowed to feel however you want to feel. (Cry if you have to, but make sure your husband can see, maybe it will wake him up a little)-#98332: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98332","['Care: 8 people', 'Like: 5 people', 'Love: 2 people']",0 Comments,0 Shares

Neither he has the looks, body and he drinks and smokes as well. During the first few months, he’s very attentive towards me, nice and caring, like what typical couples would go through during the honeymoon stage.After we got together, he became cold, I guess the sweetness wore out. We rarely went out to have a proper date, only dinner and his place typically. I guess we are quite chill about it?Though I mentioned to head out once in awhile, he would ask me to plan everything, which i got the impression that he’s not interested. But ok la, he still help me whenever I needed. All these are fine, just probably I’m quite particular about him not greeting my parents.Only after 2 years, he went up to my place. During the past CNY, he didn’t bother to come over. I’ve tried inviting him over for dinner during non-festive periods, he would just MIA and reply afterwards. I didn’t want to force him to come over, but just wanna to know if this behaviour is normal?Brought this concern of mine to him, and what he told me was, after marriage, with kids and all, we probably don’t see our parents all the time.

There were already 2-3 guys who were chasing her. I mean they switched places just to sit closer to her and they would stay back to help her with her issues.When she was an intern, I did not really pay much attention because most of the time, they would leave within a few months. I just socialised with her just like I would with any other colleague.As I see her more often nowadays, I have started to feel more attracted towards her. I have never dated before because I was too shy/introverted and too focused on studies. I also don't really look good although I am fit. I am lean muscular so you cannot see the definitions without me removing the shirt which absolutely sucks. I do not really know how to approach without being inappropriate. I mean she was an intern here which means I am senior. There is also the problem of the other guys who are constantly chasing her. Recently, there was no one at the office so I asked her if she wanted to go out for lunch with me. However, she turned me down. I felt really bad. I have gone alone with other female colleagues for lunch and I had no issues so far. If she was even remotely interested in me, she would have come with me right? There was also this incident where she forgot to pass me some documents even though she knew I needed them urgently. It kind of shows that she is not interested in me again. I don't know what to do here. Is appropriate to fall for you colleague who was an intern? If I ask her out, would it spoil the relationship? I already failed a simple lunch meeting, how in the world is she going to like me? By the way, how to ask? I don't even know how to ask. Would I creep her out? How do I be attractive to her? How do I impress her? I cannot even get close to her to know her because she is always surrounded by people. Does she even think about me?AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

98322,"I always have this feeling that Westerners are much better in many aspects compared to us. They are much more independent as they move away from their parents when they are 18 whereas most of us are probably staying with our parents until our 30s. This is not really our fault since it is expensive to own a house here but it does make less more reliant on our parents. When it comes to conversation, they are more friendly and are willing to engage in conversation with stranger whereas we are more conservative and tend to mind our own business which may make us seem cold and aloof. Westerners tend to be more creative and more daring to take risk while we tend to be more stick to the old fashion method. Our thinking is rigid and we are good in route learning but not so much in analytical thinking. Usually, Westerners are more vocal and tend to be dominant in the social setting and I heard from some people that they feel that ""I don't think Asians are capable of standing up for themselves when they are bullied.""

98320,"A true story. I encourage those guys finding their better half not to give up.I met a very nice pretty lady during the time I was doing paid delivery part time. I held a professional full time job as well. Even before meeting her, on the app I told her that I was a criminal who went to prison for 10 years rape. I asked her if she was comfortable if I were to be delivering to her appartment. I did this because I had given up on finding the right woman. So I might as well project a negative image of myself for fun right?Things took a turn. She was the only one who thanked me for my honesty. The others requested that I should not even be dealing where female customers are or that they do not want me there. I also received a number of nasty comments from some women. For the first time I had full experience of what ex convicts experience.Eventually the lady who thanked me and I started dating. I had to live my lie. When we started living together, I would go out of home to work as a storeman only to collect my office clothes at a self-storeage facility, shower in the gym toilet and change into office attire. The whole process was tedious. After work it was drycleaning of my clothes at self service laundry and to the self storeage and then back home. For her my long hours at work were okay as she thought my job was demanding. In fact 4 of the 12 hours I was supposed to be working were spent in the cover up process.We dated on weekends and she did not even ask how I was able to afford some items with my salary. She did not even ask why I did not have to work weekends and public holidays.We rented a room to stay with her paying all of the rent since she thought I did not earn much.

During this time, I feel as if his father is always taking the chance to find things to criticise me. He would question me during dinners in front of their whole family and I feel as if I’m being interrogated. It honestly even makes me lose my appetite. He loves to ask me about my job (as my bf is a manager in his company & earns more than me) and when I try to explain what I do, I can tell he doesn’t really understand since my work is pretty technical. He will then try to downplay my job and say things like “oh so you are doing administrative work la? Doesn’t seem like progression is good..” I don’t know if it’s his way of hinting me that I’m not good enough for his son but it really makes me super uncomfortable.

98318,"I would like to share my story of why money is not what woman are looking for. When I first met my husband, he was not attractive. He doesn't sweet talk or bring me to nice places. I got together with me as I was eligible age to get married and I have nothing to complain about him. Previously, I dated many guys from online who are sweet talkers, confident, mind of their own, earn some money etc. But most of them end up 2 timing or 3,4,5 timing me. I didn’t know how much he earn, I just felt comfortable with him. Naturally, we got together and got a BTO after 7 months of dating. After that, then he propose to be at a car park and we moved in to live with his family. His career wasn’t that stable. At one time in time, he was merely earning $4k a year as a self employed person. My career was good and at one point, I was earning 33 times of what he earn. While staying with his family, we have many conflict with his siblings. He never once side him or argue with me for them. His only soft spot is his mum, where he would just keep quiet when I complain at times. Although he earns 20% of what I earn now, he still pays every time we go out. I pay for big ticket items like house, car and holidays while he pay for everyday expenses. I felt love as I know he is not stingy or calculative with his money and spend everything he has on our family. He always say his money is my money. I graduated from NUS while he graduates from overseas university. I never feel that he is stupid. In fact, I learn a lot from him as he watch a lot of documentary and has lots of common sense. I may have better education from him, but he taught me many things about life. In fact, the boring guy he was 10 years ago, has turn into a sweet talker. He still praise me, give me confidence and hug and touch me at times. He also pays attention to me. Whenever I am in pain, I would scream and he will appear immediately. Although I paid for the car, he drives me around and fetch me wherever I go. He would call me and pick me up without me asking. Sometimes, I would reject him as I feel is a waste of petrol and he would still insist. I may not be the ideal woman to marry. I cant cook well, I don’t take care of kids that well, I don’t clean well. But he never complains about me. He loves me the way I am. Sometimes I think what have I done to deserve such a good man like him. Sometimes I will say he is almost perfect, if he earns more he will be perfect. I am still a money-minded woman. Money is still very important to me. It is ironic that my husband is not rich, but I love him the way he is as his character is more important than anything else. If you ask the younger me if I will date someone who earns lesser than me, I will say no. But character is actually more important than how much he earns.-#98318: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98318","['Like: 470 people', 'Love: 77 people', 'Care: 52 people']",87 Comments,74 Shares

98316,"So i just graduated from nus. It wasnt easy i would say. I struggled for most of my nus education. I was second lowers for the first two years of uni. At y2s1 i was really really tired of not doing well.. always getting Bs.. never an A- or even A. The best i got was B+. I was so demoralised and i felt that i wouldnt be able to find a job at this rate. (My cap at that point of y2s1 was 3.5/5)- it was horrendous). I even felt suicidal at one point, not having alot of friends to confide in and also not able to meet my parents expectations.However, my life changed at y2s2 when i happened to take the same module with my jc friends. They were high first class students at that point and they were really really motivated. And surprisingly, their motivation really had an effect on me. Their habits also had an impact on mine. They never skipped lectures. Never late for lectures. Always asked profs questions after class. I started to be like them. Just like that, i started to see an improvement in my results and more and more ""A""s started appearing on my academic transcript.Looking back, it was really satisfying that i managed to pull my cap from a borderline 3.5 second lowers to a 4.53 this sem. Not trying to flex or haolian or anything...I just wanted to share this with my school mates out there that nothing is impossible if you put your heart and soul into it. Most importantly, the friends you hang around with really have a huge impact on you.P.s i am starting my PhD in nus next sem so yea..to all those students struggling out there.. dont give up!! because i definitely didnt!!

98315,"So my girlfriend and I are fighting over this simple thing. I used to be very bocap/lazy in terms of dressing style and grooming in general which meant I got less dates. However, I saw a sharp increase in the number of dates I went after I put in effort to manage my appearance.I got into a relationship with this girl. I chose her because she is a kind and caring person. However, I did not like her dressing style compared to other girls I dated before. After a while, I started suggesting that she try wearing a but more shorter or revealing outfits to look a bit more sexy. I suggested that she wear regularly if possible and if not, at least a few days a week. She got angry and started saying it is her choice to wear whatever she wants. I do not disagree. I put in a lot of effort to look good so I felt that she could do something as well. I also did sacrifice and do  other things for her so I suggested that she could sacrifice a bit for me as well. I don't usually ask her for things by the way. She just downright refused to do it, not even to wear sexy outfits once a week. I talked to her and found out that she is not comfotable showing so much skin. I told her that maybe we can take it in small steps, maybe wear slightly shorter and slowly increase the shortness over time. Still she refused. Finally, I suggested that she wear sexy outfits when she is at my place or her place. She got furious at this point because I kept on trying so she refused to talk to me for a while.At this point, I got so pissed off. Guess what I did. I did not bring up about this outfit issue to her. I just went back to my bocap style of dressing, just a sligtly oversized t-shirt, shorts and a pair of slippers. I would wear this outfit no matter where we went, including those classy restaurants. She felt embarrassed at one of the place and asked me why I am wearing such as outfit. I refused to answer her question and just talk about something else. I do not want to fight around this. By the way, the bocap style is the most comfotable form of dressing.Now, I know all the girls want to rage at me but wait, I did not do anything wrong here. In fact, it is fair. Throughout this process, I did not force her. I only made suggestions to her. Despite making sacrifices for her, she did not try to make any forms of adjustments for me. It felt unfair to me. By the way, I do most of the work in the relationship, like planning dinners or outings, buying gifts, accompanying her, waiting for her after school, etc. Now, it is fair because like her, I don't need to put in effort in my dressing to try to impress my romantic partner. It should go both ways. I should be able to wear whatever I want, similarly to the fact that she can wear whatever she wants.Some of you may say that I do not deserve her but I feel that it goes both ways. Despite her not making adjustments for me, I still found a way to make it fair for us. If she still decides to break up with me for this, then I can't do anything. I have tried my best in this relationship.

98314,"Hi everyone, I just wanna ask for advice in asking out a friend.Here's some context. I, (28m), met this girl (24) when we were both in the same class in poly. We only became friends when we were going home together one day and realised we have similar interests. Initially, I was pretty awkward when it comes to having conversations with her. I don't have much female friends in the first place. Eventually, this friendship developed to the point where I was pretty talkative around her and we often hang out with mutual friends. This friendship remained strong even after graduation and we went to seperate universities. We also went on an overseas trip together. It was during this trip that I started to see her as more than a friend, but I wasn't sure if what I was feeling was fleeting . During the pandemic, she had some trouble with her studies and was diagnosed with depression. When she told me this, I tried my best to be supportive of her and her mental well-being. I really care for her and I still want to be with her.Here's the problem I'm facing. I'm a very introverted person, especially with women. I have no experience whatsoever with relationships. I have a low self-esteem and I don't see myself being someone who is good enough for her. Also, I don't think I was able to comfort her properly during her depressed moments. wouldn't mind being rejected if I asked her out, but I really don't want our friendship to be affected due to this.

98306,"To #98264 Mental well being is very important. I have worked for a few years now and have notice the rise of such issuesIf this is your first job, I would suggest to start looking out first before resigning. Take a look at the job market and see if is moving well. If is slow, I suggest you hold on first. You are only a few months into your new job, so probably taking 2 weeks of leave is out of question, otherwise I would have suggest so, than to resign.Is easier to manage your own expectations than to manage others. If this is not your first job, I may have to be alittle direct here. Try to reevaluate your suitability for the role, or this career that you choose to be in. If the reason for leaving past jobs has been due to culture misfit, then perhaps gotta relook at your own strengths and see where they can play best at. Every company has its own set of problem and culture, you have to be adaptable to it. However let no one de-value you in any possible ways you can offer.  Talk to your partner about your BTO. That for sure can’t change. But financing it can. Talk to the professional to see how you can work around the finances over owning a house. It can be tough on one side, but is going to be temporary.

98305,"2 years ago, i found out my husband visited clubs with those skimpy dressed girls. He assured me that the girls just sit by the men to pour drinks, no nonsense. Of cos, i wasn’t naive and i am sure they are free to touch those girls. I forgave him anyway, as he said it was just for fun and knew his limits. I wasn’t going to call off my marriage because i have a young daughter, and the matter seem too trivial to make my daughter a single- parent family child. I told him i’m liberal enough to understand sometimes when men go out together they need to go to such places to boost their ego, but warned him to keep his limits. He promised no such places again. 2 years now, he’s been good, responsible and very hardworking, we live a comfortable life. Recently, i chanced upon an old chat while searching his phone for some info (he knew i was using his watsapp to search). The chat read: A- i have headache. Husband-then u shd join us for massage later. This is the same day 2 yrs ago when he went out to the skimpy-dressed girls club. And i knw this is a dirty massage place he is referring to, as 2 yrs ago i confronted him, he told me the guys proceeded to this massage palour but he did not go. So now, obviously, this old chat meant that HE WENT? Cos he is asking his friend to join them at massage? What shd i do now?? I have forgiven him then, shd i question him abt this now?

98301,"Dear post #98264 (on whether to quit new job), one year ago I wrote an anonymous post because I was facing the same dilemma as u (u may go read my post #89154). I was constantly stressed and worried, anxious and upset. I was also overworked and disenfranchised, asking myself why am I working so hard and what is my purpose in life. In summary, I felt that I was suffering from burnout, PTSD on a demanding job and it was affecting my self esteem, my productivity and ultimately the workplace suffers from my lackluster outlook.After reading the kind comments by the netizens, I start to reflect and ask myself what is the most important thing in my life. Sure I was drawing an above average pay, working in a stable large organization, but I wake up everyday like a zombie, start work at 8am, rush through all these deadlines sometimes without lunch and dinner, knock off at 3am, and the cycle repeats. One comment on my post that jumped out at me was whether the life I was living was sustainable, and there is no point in earning to pay my medical bills. When my workplace decided not to give us promotions and raises despite having the best performing year (my industry is countercyclical and does well when the wider economy is in recession), I told myself, that's it - I'm not there for the passion, my health was getting poor, work so hard and yet remuneration does not commiserate with the hours put in. So I left my job, I did things which I enjoyed, wake up everyday naturally, take long walks, attended courses which I always wanted to. It felt Abit odd when everyone else was hustling so hard in the prime of their age while I had zero income/only cash outflow but sometimes life works in miraculous ways - one day one of my ex-colleague contacted me to help him out on a part time basis, so I only had to devote few hours a day for work. Afterwards, because we had such great chemistry working together, I joined him on a full time basis. Looking back, I feel that sometimes we try too hard when life has its ways of opening another window for u when one door closes. Everyone is trying to find our own little way to survive, but don't let pressures of life get you down. Sometimes u know it in ur gut that something is not right, but we are so afraid of being the odd one out and doing things out of the norm. It's perfectly ok to stop and take a deep breath, rest, and start walking on a different path when u are ready - and don't let anyone or anything dictate the timing for when that happens. I believe at some point in our lives, we'll suffer from quarter-life/mid-life crisis. The good thing is we can all reach out to someone to talk about our issues, and I hope my own story can give u courage to take the course of action only u can decide.

98299,"Here's another complain of how people see the Marcoms team. We are NOT graphic designers. Most of us went to a communications or marketing school, not a design school. Stop pinning the blame on us for not having skills in photoshop or indesign. Stop asking for 'contingency plans'  if the team's designer goes on leave or not available on that particular day you want to have work done. Seriously, don't expect the poor Marcom person to go for a 3 day, one week, one month course on photoshop or indesign and expect him or her to come out of it like a pro, being able to have the SAME particular set of skills as someone who spent 3 - 5 years in a design school and the next few years accumulating experience on design concepts.Yes, upskilling is necessary. But not everyone is interested in graphic design, let alone willing to invest a fair sum on Adobe Design programs. Even after 'upskilling' from those courses, constant practice is needed to use those programs proficiently but those programs do not come cheap. Pay for what is worth, hire what is needed instead of preaching no money, no business, no income, and the next thing your employees know, you F buying a new car. For those who becoming bosses, dept heads in future, please, please, don't combine the roles of a designer and communications/marketing together. They are two totally DIFFERENT disciplines and are a full time role by themselves. Marcoms people are not gods/goddesses. The practice making people do outside what you are trained to do is unhealthy and creates alot of unrealistic expectations to perform. I'd like to reiterate that while it is important to keep yourself relevant, these are practices that shouldn't become the norm because it only puts the blame on an employee who get set upon with expectations that are outside his or her control.

98294,"I had a crush on this girl who was in my clique. However, she turned me down because I was not her type. I am you average normal guy except I am very smart academically. We usually studied together as a group and I helped everyone. She later went on to date this rich and handsome guy. Since then, she started appearing lesser in our clique meetings and for lessons as well. However, she would message me for lecture/tutorial notes because my notes were well organised and useful. I felt as though I was being used a little but I just said to myself that I am just helping as a friend. Then, there were also some disturbing signs that she was being physically abused. We tried to talk to her about it but she refused to talk about it. Once, we confronted her boyfriend about this and she started scolding and raging at us instead. We stopped pursuing it and just focused on studying together. I saw her crying once and just sat with her. We did not really talk much but I was just there for her. This happened a few times and sometimes, she would call me just be with her. She did not call the others because they were fed up with her attitude. I was the ""nice"" guy.I never understood why she picked such an abusive guy over me. The worst part was that she stayed in the relationship despite the abuse which made me so darn confused.The toxic relationship became worse and to a point where he was blackmailing her. She was already at her limit. She called me to be with her but this time, I had an interview for my dream company. She knew I had this interview but she was so distressed and was suicidal. I had a choice. I had prepared for this interview for the past month and had already gone through 2 intense rounds. I could go for the interview and hear on the news that my friend committed suicide. So, I told the interviewer that I could not attend the interview and they said that I would be dropped which I had to accept. I went to her and convinced her not to do anything stupid. It took a while but their relationship was resolved (not going to go through the details here). I was there to support and actually did quite a bit of fair things to get it resolved like talking to lawyers and stuff. I did not go for internship that summer because of this. Then, we got together, married and lived happily ever after. The end.Ok the last line did not happen because this is not the movies, it is real life. She had to recover from the past relationship which took her months of therapy. I did help her along the way. I knew in my heart that we would not get together. I did not do it to make her fall in love with me. I just did it as a friend. I pained me to see her like that state. She was the prettiest girl in my course and she had such an upbeat personality before the relationship. After a while, she slowly started to reply my messages after a few days. She did not talk as much to me as before. I felt as though we were growing apart. We stopped meeting and when I asked to meet, she would say that she is busy or not reply. Due to covid, our lessons became online so we don't see each other physically that much.Then, I found out that she got into another relationship. This time another rich and handsome guy. Although this guy was not physically abusing, he was obnoxious and bullied her/controlled her. I guess he was not that bad. I found this out through a mutual friend accidentally. I guess that is her type. I felt so bad, not because she did not choose me this time but because I felt used. She did not tell me about her new relationship. I gave up my dream internship and so much of my time for her and she did nothing for me. She still asked me for my notes right before the exams. Half my mind was just to ignore her message and delete/block her number. I just ignored the message because I was pissed. However, I felt bad and guilty as though I am doing something wrong instead. In my heart, I felt really bad as days went by. In the end, I did what my heart told me and sent the notes. What do I do here? I knew ignoring her was the right action but my heart kept on pestering me. I don't know how to proceed here. The worst thing that could happen is that she calls me to support her again when her boyfriend sends her into an emotional downfall.

98293,"I am a very nice person. I am the kind that puts others before self and is always volunteering or helping people. I would help everyone even though at times, no one returns the favor. I don't take sides in classes and I have even helped people who tried to do bad things to me. I feel as though I don't want to do bad things and stoop to a low level as them. I believe an eye for eye makes the whole world go blind. I just want to lead my life as a good person and I just take situations such as that as tests that challenge my goal of living as a good person. I do fight but only when someone I care about is being hurt (I mean like seriously hurt like physical harm and not petty arguments) and I only fight for others. However, people see me as a wimp or someone who can't protect himself. It is very rare that there would be a serious situation where I need to protect someone (it is not like everyday there is someone punching your friend right?) so most people don't get to see that side of me. I am also considered as a boring person. I am also usually compared as though I am a baseline which is difficult to explain so let me give an example. My friends says this to another person, ""Eh, even (my name) has watched this netflix show. How come you never?"".  You can replace ""netflix show"" with clothes, etc. I am also the anything guy for food or places to visit. It is not that I don't have opinions, it is just that arguing about such things in my opinion is not worth it. However, my friends mistake this and think that I am someone without any opinion.For the most parts, I don't really care what others think or should I say that I have stopped caring what others think. I had a rough childhood where I was bullied because I had below average looks. The only thing I learned the experience is that you can't let negative things affect you. No matter what I did then, there will always be someone that hurt me in one way or another. The problem comes when I try to date. Not generalising here and everything I say here is from my experience. To be honest, most girls think I am boring and I do have below average looks. When I confessed to girls, it is 100% that I get rejected. With dating apps, I had better luck. I had 1 girl who matched with me in 1.5 years (others were catfish or pranksters). I am quite young so I understand that girls want to have fun. Oh yes, one of the biggest turn off factor for them is that I don't drink alcohol and axiomatically, I don't club. The girls who are my friends go on to date my other friends who are more flashy ( wear branded clothes, have car, go a lot of clubbing, etc.). I am an introvert so I don't have that funny personality that girls seek. I do joke a little but it is not like every 2 out of 5 lines is a joke.  Maybe the problem is with my expectations? To me, I don't really choose girls based on looks, dressing or how fun the person is. I do look for character and morals. I don't think that is a very high expectation when I compare my friend's list of long expectations.When I ask my friends for advise, they suggest that I need to be more flashy. I tried being flashy for a while but I felt as though I was not myself. If I want to be with a girl, she should accept me for who I am. I always thought that being a good person is the most valuable quality that anyone should have. However, in reality, it doesn't seem to matter that much. As long as you are not extreme in your character, then most girls are fine. They want to have fun. They want prince charming. So here is the prediction that my friends made for me. There are two things that could happen. 1) I will remain single for the rest of my life. 2) I will find someone but only at the later stage of my life. This person would have already gone through a few ""fun and exciting"" relationships and is prepared to settle down so they pick me for stability. Both sound cruel to me.....The closest character that I identify my situation with is Shrek. Everyone watched the movie and probably enjoyed it. Everyone also know the lessons from the movie. However, in reality, everyone wants Prince Charming and nobody wants Shrek as their life partner.-#98293: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98293","['Care: 15 people', 'Like: 14 people']",25 Comments,1 Share

Once in a while, I’ll go to his fb & whatsapp to see pictures of him and his wife. I decided to be the bigger person and not inform his wife about his inappropriate messages when he’s already married.

98275,"To the OP of #98230Hopefully my story can allow you to reflect and understand the situation better.I have two children from a prior marriage. My ex-husband was a man child while we stayed with his parents. I’m the one who cares about striving to earn higher income and taking care of children needs while he quitted his job and became in and out of job over the years. He was not interested in trying to earn more money, more importantly not interested in self-improvement of any kind and taking care of the children unless being peristently asked to. When we divorced, one child followed my ex-husband while the other child followed me. A few years later, I met someone attractive (in a personality way): he likes to exercise, is family oriented and has a stable job. He accepted me, my child and my past, and we got married. After marriage, he changed gradually even as we have our third child: not interested in exercising and maintaining his weight (especially shortly after our wedding ceremony), less interested in interacting with our children and have little interest to ask for higher pay in his job or switch jobs to achieve higher pay. These changes are minimal (except his disinterest to maintain his weight haha), as he still takes care of our children but this is a fraction of the time he spends on the screen. Regarding finance, we had a joint account (I still have a separate personal account but he doesn’t) and he said I can invest the money in joint account if I want to, otherwise we will leave in bank account. Besides occasional squabbles, I have not regretted being with him. Now back to my ex-husband. Since divorce, he has not quitted his job and he becomes interested in personal finance and how to grow his money. He cares a lot now more on taking care of our tween child compared to the past which he left to his parents or me to take care. I’m happy to see that he has matured and my child is in better hands.Reading your story, I wonder if the state of being married can make men (and maybe also women) desire to stagnate instead of achieving in his career, life goals (to keep fit and attractive, for example). I feel that if one partner is taking responsibility for duties and roles in the family (e.g. earning income, tending to children), the other partner may not feel the need to put in some weight to achieve better outcomes.To OP, whether you divorce your husband is your personal decision. Yes some members of society will frown upon your decision, but you yourself should know best what is the best environment for your children. If you intend to go through a divorce route, make sure you have some caregiving support, for example family members or a reliable helper to help take care of your two children, and that the divorce is amicable.

98271,"Need some career advice. I graduated from NUS about a year ago. I was luckily enough to have secured a job despite the pandemic. However, the people in the company was extremely toxic and I quit my job within 6 months (it was a rotation program and i quit during the 1st rotation) as i was having alot of mental health problems (panic attack, anxiety ,probably depression due to the job) I then joined this multinational company which was actively hiring and got in. However, i now understand why they are always hiring: turnover is extremely high as the workload is very heavy. My supervisor is also an extremeeee micromanager (A very polite way to put it). During my regular check-ins with her, i mentioned how the workload might be heavy sometimes. And so she asked me to create a journal of some sort to take down how long i take to do each activity every day. In my next check-in with her, she asked me to list down and quantify how long i took to do each activity in the past week. Above all, she commented about how my hair was messy etc ( but mind you i am in an ops position with no needs of meeting any external customers) Just wanted to clarify, everyone i have spoke to in my team think that the workload is too heavy and we have high turnover rates (On average 1 year - 2 years.once, the fastest to leave would be in less than 4 weeks). Everyone wants to leave. When the team makes a small mistake in their work, we would have to start digging out pass records and my manager would press you hard to find out why did you make that particular error. Higher-ups are like that too and like to ask ‘if you screwed up’. This digging of past records served completely no purpose at all and it isnt any life and death situation. Digging up the past records was just to prove the point to then on how you “screwed up”. Not to mention, during covid Phase 2HA we still had to report back to office despite our work being fully capable of being done at home. I completely see no future with the team and cant wait to leave every single day. But with my current job record: 1st job being about 6 months and i am in my current job in only about 6 months too, would anyone hire me? Internal transfer within my current company might be difficult as we would have to declare to our managers once we get the interview (i dont understand too).

My friend shared that the top management who sets the policy are those OSA staff sitting in the office. They never stepped in PGPR to do ground work and understand the struggles residents face, and spend most of their time Working From Home comfortably. cl/ra are treated quite badly and most of their emails sent by them are passive-aggressive, threatening that you will lose your position should you not attend their long-list of trainings. They are very compliance and rules based, and issues demerit points like free. They feel that since they sponsor RA with rooms, the RAs ought to devote fully on their RA responsibilities. Generally, the student leaders do not feel appreciated and they are generally very unhappy. Unlike other programmes like Hall and Residential Colleges, the professors live with you and treat the students with respect - they understand your problems, they sympathise with you and they work along you. You can ask around any of your PGPR friends, none of them would have spoken to their RAs or Management staffs.

98262,"psa warning, quite a long but juicy (i hope) story. & advise me if u can! so i entered my h*e phase somewhere back in late march and lasted only about 1.5 months because i stumbled on this dude. but here’s where it gets complicated. backstory, we swiped on each other, and all the basic intro shenanigans. but then he revealed that his ex cheated on him, and he cheated back (wtf) and they were “broken up” for a month or so alr but still hooking up from time to time. we planned for a meet up the next day at his hall. at this point i never really thought much about it because his looks are only about average-ish. but when i met him, it was his personality that really… struck a cord. he’s a little bit mean/cold, the type to make fun of/tease you. i ended up staying for almost 6 hours in his room because we were going at it for quite awhile and took breaks in between the rounds. during those breaks we would talk, and because hall beds are smaller than hotels, we were relatively close to each other physically - and you know what happens when ‘cuddling’ after an act of intimacy, oxytocin is produced. so to me, there was both physical and emotional intimacy. he also did stuff like play with my hair and touch my face, which is like ?!!?!!, cos you’re not supposed to not do that when hooking up. fast forward to when i was leaving, he even walked me out all the way and checked up on me if i returned home safely later on. and even after meeting, we would continue texting for the next few days. then he suddenly didn’t reply for a good 4 days because he was mugging for finals. during this time i was rly sad abt it cos i think i formed an emotional attachment to him alr - which never happened before with my past experiences. so then when he contacted me again, we were talking like friends, video messages of the stuff he was doing and all. we planned for another meeting the next week cos our sched couldn’t fit each other’s that week. then after confirming the next meetup, after a little while more of texting, he stopped replying again. during this time i managed to find his ex’s ig acc so i used my finsta to follow her (she was public). then a few days later she posted a pic of the two of them tgt. so i was abit sus but didn’t address it yet. so when i contacted him the next day to ask what time i should go over, he suddenly told me he had got food poisoning then i was abit like huh?? but ok i couldn’t say much cos it was casual, but he did offer to resched to the day after so i agreed. ok off track abit but during the time that we weren’t speaking was when i rly went on about being all sentimental and thinking about him a lot. so u could say i developed a crush on him. and when i wanna get to know someone i will think of some questions i wanna ask them, so i prepared a short list of qns with the intention of casually slipping it into conversation so it doesn’t seem sus. so the second meeting - id say we were more than comfortable with each other at this point and we were updating each other on what we’ve been doing since the last time we met. for me, nothing much la, no more guys cos i was kinda fixated on him alr but had to play it cool. for him, i wanted to see if he would lie about meeting his ex so i playfully asked if he met his ex, to which he responded honestly. he met her to hook up at his place. so same old same old, then we went to get food tgt after at the canteen nearby. we dabao-ed to his room and while eating i decided to slip in my questions. then we were also laughing about some stupid shit and discussing super deeply about some tiktok we saw. we were legit talking and hanging out like good friends. after food we went at it again and after, we also continued talking. so then he told me stuff like “oh actl nowadays i’m not very h*rny anym” and when i asked why he replied that it was because he got ‘enlightened’ by smt. sus…. he even asked me what i was doing later on that evening and i teased him saying like “oh why, wanna bring me out isit” but we just laughed it off la. he did/said a couple of things too (that i jotted in a very detailed account in my notes app) lol. this time round i stayed about 6.5 hours. and again, he checked up on me whether i got home but when i replied, this time he never even bothered seeing my msg (was a single tick on tele). then the heightened alert thing happened. so 4 weeks of precautionary measures and all that load of stuff. we never contacted each other throughout this period, until recently. one night he suddenly and randomly dropped me a text on tinder saying “hi b*tch are u still alive”. 1st of all. ?!!!??! 2nd, whadafakkkkk. 3rd. sudd tele doesn’t exist?? why come msg me on tinder. did he delete our tele convo? (and cos i changed my user, he probably couldn’t find me?) but taking into consideration my ‘feelings’ that i developed for him, i ofc was bloody pissed bc it’s so rude (amongst other reasons) to ghost someone for a month then pop back in like nothing happened. so i decided to wait a few hours to reply and when i did, my reply was super angsty la. THEN. the next day, surprise! HE WENT OUT WITH HIS EX. in ridiculously obnoxious couple shirts to uss somemore. (cringe btw). then omg i was even more pissed because wtf is he trying to do. so i took some time to think abt it - maybe he contacted me to tell me that he got back tgt w his ex (since that was what i told him to do). or… nvm. i don’t want to entertain the other delusional reason. but until now he hasn’t replied(hais) and it’s causing me so much anxiety because what if i enter the app and i have to see his reply ???? fact is - i shouldn’t have so much to say about this whole thing, because i’m just a casual “hookup x2” (his words) to him - but i do. and i feel a lot of stuff (conflict mostly). so. now i have no idea how to go about this. ok main reason is because i have no answer from him yet but like. was it my fault from the start for getting attached to a guy i literally just met (with some messed up/complicated shit w his ex) and reading in between the lines too much? or is it his, for giving me mixed signals. the whole time ive more or less only got mixed signals from him. fun and casual banter then no reply for days. sweet one moment but sour the next. and i swear it’s like my ego or the hopeless romantic in me that thinks that maybe he likes me too, but he’s in denial/doesn’t know what he wants. my friend says that it isn’t my fault because catching feelings isn’t a crime. but… idk. some days i want to just drop it all and just confront and confess how i feel about the whole situation and him, but apart from chances of rejection, i’m risking never speaking to him again (i made it a point to myself that if he ever got back w his ex, i will disappear from his life) and boosting his ego because he will think that he has options now and i don’t want that to be a reason for him to treat his gf/girls like shit. this is the part where it gets a little delulu; you can ignore this part. so let’s say it all falls into my favour, we get tgt and all that, but keep in mind he was a cheater. i don’t want to live w the mentality that “once a cheater, always a cheater” but there’s the risk of it, isn’t it? he also said that even if he and his ex broke up for real, he doesn’t think that there will be a clean cut (whatever the hell he meant by that). the thing is, do i really want him though? do i really like him for him - or do i just like him because he doesn’t want me, because he’s emotionally unavailable? and how how how do i go about this, should i just leave it, block him or confront him and get closure?-#98262: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98262","['Haha: 26 people', 'Like: 12 people', 'Wow: 3 people']",57 Comments,15 Shares
98260,"Utterly disappointed that NUS decided to move a prestigious graduation ceremony online without giving the most important  promise to the class of 2020 and 2021 on a postponed physical ceremony . Stanford University has resumed their in-person graduation ceremony. What is the rationale of NUS trying to  hold 2 graduation ceremony? Absolutely ridiculous! Waste of time and resources! Why can't NUS just wait and give the postponed physical commencement at a later time? Due to the pandemic, nobody is rushing them.On the other hand , the school is pro-active and spending all its marketing resources to get the graduating cohort to give back through multiple donations.  Why can't the school spend equal effort to seek the opinion of the graduating cohort on a physical ceremony just as much as its effort to fundraise from the graduating cohort? Also, It is also disappointing to see the previous petition for a postponed physical ceremony being swept under carpet. NUSSU is only seen as being overly reactive to petitions yet nothing concrete done - zero updates after the petition ( It has been more than a month).

This was based on a fortune teller that my parents strongly believe in.I’m saying this because my current bf is someone that is younger than me, and, if they were to find out that Im dating a guy below my age, they would strongly oppose it.

I was like thinking why do I get together with her in the first place when I don't loved her that much? Sad to say, that was both our first relationships and it only lasted for about 8 months. Though we broke off amicably, we are still close friends. Recently, with nothing much to do and the need to clear excess annual leave, the idea of staycation was suggested by me to her and I was surprised that she agreed. I had wanted to use this opportunity to know her more physically including having sex, but I had reservations that she may not be ready for it.My mind thinks of sex quite a lot and masturbates to porn quite frequently since I don't really have any hobbies, thankfully I can still function normally at work? I admit, being a guy, it's hard to keep my horny hormones in check despite the fact that I am nearing 30 in a couple of years time. I am in an industry where despite there are a lot of females including a batch of younger females coming in, they are not my type as I have very high expectation of how my ideal type should look like.

98252,"Hi Prof Ben / friends, what would you do if you were in my situation?My mom works as an office assistant and she's not drawing much in gross monthly income. I started work about 2 years ago, and was lucky enough to find a job that paid me a decent starting pay (take home amount about S$4,500). I decided to give my mother a monthly allowance of about S$700 as I wanted her to live more comfortably. I felt that the amount was fair because I was staying with my parents and I ought to pay my fair share of household expenses.Over the last two years, I have also gifted my mother various things which she had wanted, each of which costs between S$400 to S$800 (such as a phone, a new vacuum, massage chair and exercise device).I performed quite well at work and my current take home amount is about S$6,000. I have not increased my mother's allowance (and have no intention of increasing the allowance) as I do not think my mother needs the extra cash. This has caused some tension between us.Earlier this year, I moved out of my house (and into a shared apartment) for my mental wellbeing due to regular quarrels at home (my stepfather is a narcissist and everyone in the family quarrelled with him frequently). I continued to give my mother the same monthly allowance (S$680) as I felt I could afford it financially and I did not want to disrupt her way of life too much. That said, my mother thought that I was being wasteful as the rental fees could have been given to her as additional allowance. I don't think she really needs the money for daily expenses - she recently spent about S$3,000 on some cosmetics products. My parents also have a good amount of savings (about S$600-700k in investments and no debt); together with my monthly allowance and her salary, the amount should be sufficient for my mother to live well enough. I recently shared my hopes and dreams for the next 2 years with my mother, which on hindsight was a mistake. I wanted to move to my own apartment once I get my big raise next year. This is important to me and is something which I have been looking forward to. She asked how much the rental would cost and I said about S$2,000. She responded that she would like to retire soon, and essentially insinuated that I was being wasteful with my money (e.g. I could have supported my family instead of spending the money in wasteful things like rental which I don't really need). She stopped talking to me after that and said, ""why have I raised a child like that?"" This was hurtful because someone I loved did not share the same excitement for my future.Additional background: My mother paid >S$100,000 for some overseas programme which I wanted to attend when I was younger, but she said several times over the years that I didn't have to repay her at all and I should pursue my dreams. On the one hand, I feel a little guilty because she spent so much money on me but I am unwilling to share part of my success with her. On the other hand, I feel like I am treated like a golden ticket to a good life. I am quite confused and would appreciate some advice! -#98252: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98252","['Like: 35 people', 'Care: 24 people']",60 Comments,10 Shares
98250,"I first met her while working as a part-time staff during my poly holidays, while she was an university intern. Even though she was older than me by 7 years, she made me felt welcomed and I was quite touched that she made the effort to keep in contact with me after so many years, though due to our busy schedules we would only meet up once or twice per year.Years passed, and we would be in different stages of lives. Having went through poly, NS, university and now as a working adult, while she had finished university and is now married to her husband. It was only last year where we revealed all our most intimate thoughts to each other. We had crushes on one another back then but due to our age gap, this relationship can only be a friendship and nothing much. While looking back on our chat, she had expressed feelings of regret as why I am younger than her and wished that I am older, and because of this, she feels that I looked much more mature than ppl of my age and independence which attracted her.One day last year, while chatting, I guess lust took over me and I sent links to porn websites to her. I was worried that she would be angry at me for sending porn to her, but she was quite chill about it. However, no matter how much I teased her, she was quite adamant about no sharing of nudes, even though I told her that I would delete it. Her marriage was in ruins by then as her husband was very busy due to work and don't loved her, not to mention that she had to satisfy her own needs as her husband wasn't open to sex. I was a horny virgin and never seen real nudes before, and all sorts of dirty thoughts were in my mind.I wished that time could go back to when we first met each other when she was single, and I could be more direct with her. She told me that back then she would be ok with me sharing her nudes with me as she was single and her body was in a better condition. I knew that things have changed between us physically and she wasn't happy with her figure now so she felt that sharing of nude pictures wasn't appropriate. I imagined how she looked like naked and sent pictures and asked her to comment how close does the pictures resembled her, and from there I let my imagination took over. Of course, besides wasting effort and rolls of toilet roll, nothing changed her attitude.I should stop wondering how she looked like naked as this is getting a bit of a distraction? I still function normally in my daily life but deep down, wondering how women looked like naked is quite a sin? My only relationship was quite a failure as my ex was quite fat and physically I wasn't attracted to her, and the only thing physical we did was holding of hands.

98238,"Have a feedback that I'll like to share with the NUS undergraduate admissions office. During my time in NUS, I was shocked to learn that majority of my polytechnic classmates came from Temasek poly, even more so than those who came from Singapore poly and Ngee Ann poly combined. With the no. of students coming from Temasek Polytechnic being so out of proportion, I suppose NUS admits students based on face value of the applicant's poly GPA instead of their relative GPA. Unlike other polytechnics, there is no bell curve in Temasek poly. Thus, there is no limit to the number of students in Temasek poly who can be awarded A's and any average student can easily get 3.7-3.8 out of 4. In other polys such as Singapore poly where there is actually a bell curve, a 3.7 gpa would already be considered the top, in the 90th percentile at least. Perhaps NUS isn't familiar with how poly grading systems work but moving forward, I sincerely hope that the Admissions office could do a proper review i.e. only admit the top 15% of overall applicants from each polytechnic and obtain the statistics/median gpa of graduands from each polytechnic. If we continue to go by absolute gpa, it would be extremely unfair to students from other polytechnics.-#98238: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98238","['Like: 12 people', 'Wow: 5 people', 'Haha: 3 people']",7 Comments,3 Shares

We have two very young children and definitely need money and i do help him to apply jobs, update his resume but he’s really not wanting to change job. Before you say anything, I’m always trying to look out for opportunities (other than when I was pregnant) and thankfully I recently secure a job that can pay me higher. I am not ambitious because I’m still a lower level employee despite being a NUS graduate as well. Still individual contributor and earning $4+k as well even though I graduated >10 years already. Disappointing right? But I’m still on the lookout for even a better salary than my current one if I can, a job scope that I may like better than my current one. And yes… if I had opened my eyes bigger before marriage, I definitely will not marry him (because of some other issue). But now we have two kids and yes, I do bring up divorce every now and then which is very depressing because I know in relationships and marriage, breakups and divorces should not always be brought up. I’m embarrassed yet I cannot stop myself from thinking about divorcing. My income is not high but I can definitely support my two kids alone and I don’t need another child (my husband). I’m really annoyed he’s not standing up as a man to take care of our family - be it physically, emotionally or financially. I don’t need him to pay for my shopping and I definitely do not go for any luxury goods. He’s just hanging there waiting to pass time. Many times I told him why did he even get into a relationship when he doesn’t even want to take on responsibility of being a husband and a father. I’m his first gf but he’s not my first bf. He doesn’t invest, doesn’t look for the best interest rates for savings accounts to try to ‘earn more’. He doesn’t try to improve himself. He only likes to watch people playing game on YouTube and watch soccer highlights. He sleeps very little every night doing all these boliao things which really annoy me because it affects his health.To me, he should take care of his health and prioritise on things especially when he has me and two children. But he doesn’t care?!?!?! To think he’s the eldest of 4 in his family but still really useless in all aspects of taking care of people. I know I will get slammed here but I really wanna hear viewpoints from others. He has changed since we got married and moved into our house.

My internship supervisor seems to hate me now just because I can't get one assignment right, and I don't think my actions warrant such treatment.From my point of view, I don't think I am a poor performing intern. I contribute rather substantially to the code base under the task assigned. It is just that a particular tech stack is confusing, and suffers from conflicting information on the web, so I had a hard time understanding how the company worked with it without proper guidance.  For someone like who is completely unaware of the entire tech-stack, my supervisor's instructions were 'hint-ish' at best and cryptic at worst. Despite my best efforts to resolve the issue and actually get the code working, it somehow always result in her saying ""This is not the way we do things"", ""Why didn't you do this as instructed"", despite the fact that attempts to follow her lacklustre instructions never got the code to work at all. When I tried to clarify time and again, it seems at one point she was so fed up that she booted me off the assignment. I was polite all the way through, so it seems she was genuinely bothered at the fact that a fresh intern is automatically initiated with the specifications of the company management, which was never briefed to me in my tenure thus far.Next week, I will be reshuffled to another department in the company. I am afraid that news may spread that I am a stupid and incompetent intern, and it may affect my internship experience for the remaining 5 months.May I know if this is all because I really am a bad intern, I have an unreasonable boss, or I should have done things differently along the way.

98221,"I have a question about blind rage. I don't know whether that's the correct term for it but maybe those with pschology background or have good relationship related wisdom can correct me.I get that in relationships people get upset and fight for things. Usually these fights are to make a certain aspect of the relationship better and they can get quite passionate and heated. Not ideal but hey, at least it is all for a good cause.The reason I ask about blind rage is I think my girlfriend switches into a different mode when angry. She will change topic multiple times, not respond to anything I say, and just blindly say things, scream, insult me and say all sorts of untrue things. It is like her goal is to inflict maximum damage, pain and hurt to me. Mind you this is not just for 5 minutes, it can last 2 weeks sort. Funny thing is probably 30 minutes in, she already forgot what she was fighting about, she just wants to fight for the sake of fighting. It is like some sort of vengeance thing, definitely not constructive, and definitely not for any cause or change she is passionate about. That's what I call blind rage.Almost everything the catalyst for this blind rage or should I say almost all our fights, is her being angry that I am upset or hurt by something she said or did. My girlfriend constantly tells me things like she is a very kind person, she is a person of good character. I find that very weird, like who says this kind of things, it is like she wants to label herself that way desperately. So I think if I tell her she did or said something unkind to me, that sort of threatens her self identity if that makes sense? This then becomes a sort of reflexive defense mechanism for her? I am no psychologist but 3 years of observing this has more or less convinced me this is what is happening.Sad part is I still don't know how to deal with her blind rage. Maybe if anyone knows the correct terminology for it, the internet can give me some ideas if it is a well studied mental condition. Of course any advice to make the situation better is also always welcome.-#98221: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98221","['Like: 4 people', 'Sad: 3 people', 'Care: 2 people']",10 Comments,3 Shares

As you may have already read in the comments, there is the good, and of course the bad, that is associated to this discipline of study - which I will review to the best of my knowledge as a student currently undertaking the course at present.Let me just say that Architecture students are rather known to be the bunch of “no life students with no time” on the campus. Unless you have godly time management skills or incredible stamina to pull through the semester with little sleep, the typical Architecture student will not have much time to commit to sports or club activities. In certain electives with group work involved, there are actually students who shun grouping with architecture students not because they are “slackers who do not contribute”, but rather because they have “no time to contribute quality work”. Many people have little to no idea as to what we actually do in school, and depending on your circle of friends, you might actually be mocked at rather often. “Drawing only what”, “Make models ah, build tower I also can”, “Designing your next jenga ah” - I myself, frankly, was quite insulted by these little comments, made by close friends even, in the beginning. Over time you’ll learn how to laugh it off, but you’ll somehow still feel a little dissed for sure. I think the first thing I want to make clear is, yes, to be honest these chiding comments are not entirely wrong. But it’s also just the tip of the iceberg as to what we commit to, fret and stress about for the entirety of 13 weeks, for the 8 MC (which just means it counts as 2 normal modules) Design Studio Module.Our main core module, the 8 MC Design Studio, is the most important priority of any NUS Architecture student regardless of the semester. On paper, it only takes up one day of the timetable: from 9 -6pm, it’s the one day where you get to meet your tutor (which are mostly outsourced to practitioners) for feedbacks regarding your design. Conceptually however, it actually demands the entire week’s time for preparation and presentation. Because that one day is mainly for studio consultations, you don’t actually learn much unless you ask your tutors the right questions. And to know what to ask, that’s where you have to find time in the week to hit the books, research, and you might be surprised that it takes up quite a substantial amount of time before even the ideation phase, followed up by the production phase which is most well known by others as the “drawing” and “making models”. The importance of this core module is real, because it can only be taken once a year - if you fail it, you’ll have to wait an entire year to re-take it. And the importance of pulling through it will be drilled indirectly into you by the tutors starting from the first year. “Don’t spend so much time on your electives, they are not important”. “Your production this week is quite lagging behind others. Are you spending too much time on your CCA?”. “In Archi, the only important thing is studio”. It is not surprising that as a result, most architecture students (in my opinions) are always in search for that “easy-to-get-A elective” module, and those involving essay writings are especially loathed. Ironically, I feel this is one of the reasons why many a times, we feel so stressed when we have an idea block and end up “producing nonsense” sometimes. Innovation and creativity demanded by the curriculum, ironically, is many a times unearthed in the exploration of fields not even related to architecture at all.About the highly competitive environment…I think it’s something that varies according to what kind of batch mates you have, but it’s true. Frankly, I have even lost people whom I thought were close friends over grades. There were people who stopped talking to me after the grade for a certain group project turned out terrible, but I think this’s a niche extreme example. But when we talk about competitive, it’s a really toxic culture that not only exists between students, but even between tutors as well. Sometimes I feel that the friends you have in Archi are nice people to laugh and joke with during the holidays, but when the semester starts, they immediately become your fiercest rivals. Depending on the rigorous nature of the tutor’s studio, each week become a continuous cycle of outdoing one another in terms of graphical aesthetics, quantity of models or drawings produced…sometimes it’s really tiring and it makes me wonder what true learning really is, you know. If you are someone especially who suck at softwares and graphical production, you’re in for hell! And there’ll be tutors that will compare their studios’ work. “My studio’s site model is made of acrylic, your one…cardboard?” Even stuff like that you know. It’s a brewing toxic culture which makes one believe that the more you do, the better the architect you are becoming to be, and in turn the better your grades when it comes to the end of it all. And that brings me to my next point, the mental health of architecture students in NUS.Architecture school, regardless of whatever country you’re in, is known to be not only mentally but also physically tiring as well. Unlike other disciplines of study, it’s not like we have textbooks to refer to, you know. And because there’s no “fixed syllabus”, tutors don’t really teach - they only “teach” through answering what you are interested to find out about each week, so the mental rigor lies in the 100% self initiated and driven research which you have to do (ie hardcore google). This also applies to first year students - so for those who are coming in, you better know clearly what plans and sections are because the tutors here will not babysit you. As for the physical, assembling the model is just one half of it. The other half, is actually producing your work in time so that you can print out your drawings, or laser cut your model parts etc. Up the years, the things you have to print increases in size to A0 - A1s, and there are not really a lot of printing shops that specialises in this which are wallet friendly. And laser cutting takes time too depending on the quantity and quality, so you really have to juggle your time well and work backwards to factor in all this to make it in time for the studio consult day. If you have a unreasonable tutor who’s the kind that believe that “studio is the only module you are taking in NUS”, you’re in for pure hell. I’ve had one such tutor in my second year, and in my studio of 12 students, 4 ended up with depression by the seventh week, including myself. 2 went for UHC counselling, and 1 of them almost committed suicide. I think that was really a wake up call for myself at least, and it was bad to the point that I actually had to tell my tutor about it before he “suddenly became all nice and friendly” towards the end. Extremely disgusting. Substantial number of students drop out each semester too, I think about 6 took leaves of absence to take care of their mental health just this semester. But that aside, I think the mental health of NUS architecture students are swirling at rock bottom. In your first two years, you’ll be that fool that will be like, “How many all-nighters you pulled for this?”, “I stayed up again to do this drawing”. Come the third year, suddenly the fatigue of sleep deprivation just starts to sink in and there come a point of time you realize how sluggish you’ve become. The work only increases in difficulty and demands up the years, so let me just be frank and say there will be no escape from the occasional sleeping late and all nighters, though lesser if you have good time management. In response to the depression situation in year 2, an established tutor actually came to speak with our studio and spent half the time bragging about how her achievements were attributed to good time management and how she have never pulled an all nighter. Seriously, bitch please, which era did you study in? Back in your days, softwares wasn’t that developed, and so was design. Times have changed at the present, and anyone with your mindset is headed for sure doom and a repeat semester. Even the poly students, which are known to be the “Gods” for their skillsets, are visibly struggling. Sometimes, I wish the department would stop spewing such bullshit and be more real and less delusional about the mental health of their students. It’s so easy to say stuff like “get more sleep” and brush it off, but you know that isn't the case. In this aspect, I wish the department would really be more serious about it if they truly care. We're not just workhorses for the ever-going supplementing of jaw-dropping graphics for your instagram feed you know. We're humans too. So, treat us like one instead of iterating things like how ""it's not gonna be any better in the working world"".At this stage, I would like to say that architecture is not 100% just about bad stuff like the toxic slit throat culture, poor physical and mental health, and the non existent social work life balance. Because if it really was, no one with a rational train of thought would be taking it. As much as I hate these aspects of architecture in NUS, there are things which still fascinates me and sustain my passion, though reduced to embers over the years. I hate to say that your experience in NUS architecture will really be dependent on which tutor you get, but that is the truth that many of my friends can surely agree with. A terrible tutor will stress the hell out of you unreasonably or be too dumb to help you, but a good tutor will really inspire you and show you the world. Regardless, I felt that Architecture have really made me open my eyes and see the world, quite literally, in a new lens. Through your research, there will be times you have to dig into history, and that’s really one of the most amazing things you can empower yourself with in a world that’s ever-changing. It will make you want to travel to new places, and also the old places you’ve been to once again, to see the things with the new gained thoughts and perspectives gained in academia. And I think one of the best things about architecture, is that you’ll come to know a little bit of every field of study - like psychology, medicine, law, engineering, or even seemingly unrelated stuff like astrology or life science even - because these are the things that give you the ideas to be creative and break new grounds. The weekly consults will also imbue in you presentation and pitching skills, as well as the pre-mentioned time management skills to ensure all goes smoothly. Most importantly, I think Design Thinking in itself is one of the greatest takeaways you can ever receive. You’ll build up the courage to explore and repeat in pursue of success, and be hardened and open to even the harshest criticisms. These are soft skills which will accompany you far in life, even if you choose to leave the profession in the end. At the end of it all, I cannot guarantee that you will be that one shining starchitect ( a term used for world famous architects), but I can assure you that you will become courageous and easily adaptable to whatever the world out there throws out to you. Nonetheless, this is the pot of gold that lies at the end, though your path won’t be that of a rainbow but will instead be one cracking with flaming coals. Ultimately, it’s really about discovering what’s your calling ( so cliche, urgh!), and for those who already know, to challenge yourself to how far you can go. If you are in doubt, I think the worst thing that you can do is to not even try. A lifetime of looking back and “What if?” is truly sorrowful and real shameful, I think. To pull through it all requires strong conviction, but to leave it halfway is also by no means shameful nor disgraceful at all. My answer to those who are unsure - just jump in! Even if it’s not for you and eventually “waste one semester or two”, it’s not going to matter in the long scheme of things when you think about how long you actually have ahead of you. At the end of the day, it’s what you’ve learnt that really matters and not so much about the rat race. I actually intend to flame the curriculum more, but I think proceeding further would scare off all the architects-wanna-be, so I think I’ll hold back for now. Maybe, in another post. All in all, I hope the “real-ness” in this post is of benefit to whoever who is intending to pursue architecture in NUS, and at the same time, a ray of hope for a more enjoyable learning experience for my fellow friends struggling in this challenging course.

98211,"TL;DR - Daughter who can't stand living with mom anymore, just need to rantMy parents got divorced when I was 13, and it had a really bad impact on me, mentally and emotionally if it makes sense. I wouldn't say that I suffer from anxiety/depression etc. because I was never diagnosed and I don't wish to downplay the shit that people who do suffer from them go through. However, the emotional turmoil I was put through, did cause a lot of self-harm to happen, a lot of insecurities, a lot of just me trying to find a new identity and adapt to a new life without a happy family. A lot of these thoughts still surface even now.  My closest friends would have heard me talking about that one scene that replays in my head every now and then, of my father (one who never ever cries) choking up while wrapping my textbooks for me, while my mother packed her things in the room to move out. My dad loved and still loves my mom, the way he looked at her even now when we do meet, the way he always reminded me to listen and help my mom out because I'm the eldest. He loves her so much, but she left him because she didn't want to be with a ""poor"" man. Because I know how much my dad loves her and how much he would sacrifice his entire life just for her, that's why I hated my mom when she divorced my dad. We then moved out together, my mom got our custody and my dad didn't fight it because he didn't want my mom to go through so much. The relationship my mom and I had was horrible, I wouldn't talk to her, and I hated the sight of her. To me, she's a hypocrite who's nice only when people are around, she's nice to her friends and their kids, but doesn't treat us like humans when we're home. She does provide a roof over our heads, feeds us occasionally, but is she really a good mom if half the time she's losing her temper at us for things that were not our fault? Is she really a good mom if she hurls vulgarities at you when you were only 14, just because you didn't pack your school bag the night before? Is she a good mom if she calls you names and says ""I wanna kill you with a cleaver""? I lived with her horrible temper for close to 10 years. Even when things got better between us when I graduated from University, I would still stay out till 11 pm just to avoid having to speak to her or see her. The problem is, we share the same room and bed, so I have no choice but to face her everyday. I don't even have any sort of privacy or time alone in my room because we share a room AND BED?! uGH. For many years, I've yearned to move out on my own because dealing with her was so taxing on my mental health. I've tried taking my life a few times but failed because I always thought of my dad right before I take any action. Now that there's COVID, I've had to face her every single day at home because both of us work from home.. I am reaching my limit and I don't know how long I can deal with this. I wanna move out but rent is so expensive, but if I don't, I have to deal with her temper, insults, and ridiculous antics like buying appliances worth $5000 when she has no money and then borrowing money from us. If only there was a way to get rich quick, if only a kind soul would rent her room out to me for $100 or less, if only I was never born.. What would you do if you were me? with a measly 2.8k pay, a future to save for, and expenses to pay for? Anybody wanna take in someone who's about to lose her mind?-#98211: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98211","['Care: 14 people', 'Like: 7 people', 'Sad: 7 people']",10 Comments,1 Share
98209,"I first noticed you when we shared a lift heading to the first floor of our HDB flat. And just so happens that we were both headed to the MRT station, presumably to take the train to work.Since then I started looking out for you either during the morning walk to the MRT station or if we happened to be on the same MRT home in the evening, then sort of walk home together although it was a mostly one-sided experience. Although we're both constantly masked up, I can imagine how you look like underneath the mask. Your luminescent eyes your neat ponytail, your prim office clothing, your Michael Kors work bag. I notice them every time I see you. You probably never noticed me, just a regular guy in specs and office wear.Finally after weeks of occasional encounters, I decided that if I ever chanced upon you on the way home, I'll try to talk to you in the lift on the way up - elevator conversation?One fine day, that chance finally arrived. I noticed you in the neighbouring carriage of the MRT in the evening, and I thought, ""Yes, this will be my day."" Usually, I would keep my distance slightly behind you for the entire walk home, and never entering the same lift as you. But today was different. For the final stretch I paced myself a little faster to ensure that I'd be in the same lift as you. As we waited for the lift to come to the first floor, I practised mentally what line I'll open with.. Several possibilities popped up in my mind and as the ""ding"" sounded, I settled on the very first line I thought of.As the doors opened, my hopes were dashed as I saw a familiar face emerge from behind the lift doors.

I have no problem with coding and my worry is only about math.2) I understand that the program is rigorous but I want also to have a social life to a certain degree.

98198,"Thoughts on my situationI am a y4 students who is graduating soon, but an incident has left a bitter taste in my uni life, and with my educational journey coming to an end, I felt a need to highlight this just to get some opinions to get some closure and perhaps shed some light on how NUS handles unforeseen events.I applied for exchange to a particular university, which was cancelled (before covid) due to certain external and unforeseen events. For some reason, I was only informed of the cancellation very late (one week into the semester). Modreg was already in round 3 or completely over and i was left to choose only from modules that had vacancies left. A NUS staff was supposed to help with securing of modules, but nothing could be done to add a vacancy for any module I had planned to take. To put it simply, I could not study the specialization I was interested in anymore due to this. In addition, the profs in the modules I took did not upload any webcasts and when I approached them during to ask for any material or recording, they simply asked me to get help from a friend and…all my friends were taking other modules. With the very late start to the semester which was extremely stressful, the lack of help from the teaching staff made it worse. I was struggling a lot and ended up doing worse than normal. I could not su the mods I did badly for and it ended up affecting my cap pretty badly. I was in contact with school staff during the semester and tried many times to ask for some sort of help or leniency in the form of getting the modules I intended to study or in the form of SUs, but all my requests were met with one final reply that “my academic excellence is my own responsibility”. My emails were ignored from then on.The fact that the entire NUS cohort had 10MCs during the first covid sem always made me wonder why I was given zero help in my situation. I’ve already graduated and all, so I’m not asking for pity or for my grades to be changed. I just wanna hear opinions from different people. Should NUS have intervened and done something about it, or should I have just sucked it up from the beginning?

98187,"I am feeling very hurt by my girlfriend's actions. Wanted an objective third party opinion on whether it is valid for me to feel this way or not?My girlfriend and I currently live overseas due to uni. She is very well traveled and has already been to 70 countries which is a lot for early twenties. I have only been to 6 countries. First times are very important to me and I feel that going to somewhere for the first time is very different from repeating. Of course, a third time can be a lot better than a first time as the company is ultimately more important. But with the same company, the first time together to that place, will almost definitely be better. She knows this is how I feel. I am also aware of her extensive travel history when we first got together two years ago and mentioned I hope she can leave interesting new places for us to experience together for the first time.A bit over a year ago, she travelled somewhere overseas brand new with a friend, fully well knowing that I wanted to go there with her. I wasn't very happy but did not say much. This confession here is also not about that trip, this info is just for context. I expressed my views again but she snapped at me, so I let it rest. Recently, I mentioned a place I wanted to go with her which was not far from where we live. She agreed. Earlier today she told me she has just booked a day road trip with friends there. I was very hurt, it was the exact place I wanted to go together with her. Her only response was 1) get over it 2) don't waste my time on silly things 3) there are 2 beaches in that region how can i save all for you when you did not even mention which specific beach when you mentioned that place 4) I can't go the other beach because my friend already going there another time so she wants to go to this one 5) we booked and the tickets are non refundable.Her response only made me feel even worse and even more invisible. Firstly to me, it was not so hard to just ask me which beach given I mentioned this region to her even before they planned this road trip, it takes a few seconds to ask me. Secondly the other beach is a shithole. Thirdly the tickets for the train ride isn't even that expensive, like 30 dollars with student discount, and my girlfriend is the sort who will drop 2000 dollars on a handbag. Fourthly, there are really not many places we can go to near us which are nice, and this is one of very few options we can go to brand new together. Fiftly, she just blew me off again when I expressed these to her, telling me I am the one being hurtful because I am not supportive of her, flipping the tables onto me. She even started insulting me and hurting me further.To me, half the reason I am upset is the incident above. I felt she was very inconsiderate and did not care at all about how I feel. It's almost like she prioritizes her friends over me. Also she told me I am not invited. The other half of the reason I am upset is the way she responded when I told her I was hurt by her actions. Instead of hearing me, instead of suggesting any solutions, she chose to ignore every single point or query I had, and chose instead to attack me, and hurt me further. She chose to start a fight instead of caring. To me, this bodes very badly for the future of this relationship.Am I over-reacting? What would you have done in my shoes? What solutions do you think might work going forward in this case?-#98187: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98187","['Like: 21 people', 'Sad: 20 people', 'Care: 11 people']",72 Comments,8 Shares
98186,"Hi all, I would like to seek advice as a 21 year old guy. I'm considering NUS Architecture as my major, my fiance is really against it though the course really appeals to me. We have gotten into many arguments about it.She always gave the reason that one of her friends in this major works endlessly because it's a competitive environment. That friend mentioned that  many students in architecture find it hard to cope. According to her, there was someone who had a mental breakdown and developed an alcohol addiction during a semester and had to go for therapy. He was soon making advances towards my fiancé's friend despite being attached. He took a semester off after his girlfriend found out.She does not want me to end up this way. To me this sounded like a ridiculous tale..would like to confirm with those in Architecture if any of this is true? Also, what would yall do in my situation? I feel like my fiancé is overthinking, and I have been making efforts to make her feel more secure. But nothing seems to be working.Appreciate help from anyone!

98179,"Hey all, need your objective critique on a semi-life decision. What would YOU do in my situationSummary of events chronological order:I was a broke and angsty 16 yo girl with no parents - no financial help, had to rent rooms all the while maintaining a FT job on weekdays and PT jobs on weekends. Admitted into NUS, with highest tier of financial help because the school understood my situation. Repressed and ignored my feelings of envious, jealousy when girls or boys my age had warm families to return to even if they didn’t have wealth. I had neither of each. Entered world of sugardaddies but never had sex until recently (3 years later)Trauma and abuse from an SD/ bf which helped me as much as he harmed me. Accumulated decent wealth and CPF and employment prospects currently. Although I was admitted to the doctors a couple times for being overworked. Until today, I ignore the scars left on me, I was abandoned, defiled and raped but no one can tell my situation from the outside. I “look” rich, well-travelled and happy with family and friends.So, recently I got a marriage proposal from someone I know for a long time (he is a good man, with strong morals and ethics). His and my goals are aligned in starting a family and building a home together. He is a multi-millionaire too which he mentioned he can solve my problems if required. But the problem is, based on the trauma and experiences I have - I don’t want to give up my independence or “hustling” mentality to settle for someone who might disappoint me in the future. I’d be trading my youth, time and energy for security and money (which I need). I am only 22 btw. What would you do? Continue to sugar/ work/ date others or settle for someone who can give you the security you require in 10 years but miss out on the “fun” that you should experience in your early twenties.-#98179: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98179","['Like: 23 people', 'Haha: 9 people', 'Wow: 8 people']",36 Comments,2 Shares

Like there’s still the expectation, even if they’re not attached, that they have to plan their finances to be the breadwinner, of a potential family, for girlfriends that don’t exist yet. Then on the other hand, the same expectation is not on me as their sister. Like I’m supposed to be married off to a currently non-existent guy who is supposed to have some plan going that he is supposed to support me. Never mind that I’ve the highest earning power between all of us children and earn enough for myself.I suppose I don’t know what I should have expected given we’re an Asian country with outdated views in the 21st century. But I don’t think it’s right that we should be still defined by such traditional roles.Why should the expectation be so one sided on the guys? It’s not fair to my brothers to carry that burden and more. Like I believe paternity and maternity leave should also be equal, or at least for paternity, longer than what it is now. Let dads spend time with their kids!(Ya ya I also wanted to sign on for NS but health reasons dissuaded me.)I’m also disappointed in my fellow ladies who preach equality but still give shit like “the guy needs to pay first / ask first / support the family / when I say no I don’t mean no” I mean okay if you believe that then great for you but please don’t pretend to be preaching equality when you want the benefits of traditional gender roles too. Doesn’t work that way.But I guess I’m just one person. Can’t change society if they don’t see gender inequality as a problem and are content to let their children grow up this way too.-#98175: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98175",['Like: 69 people'],16 Comments,8 Shares

He said he knew he wasn't a nice guy. He said he was introverted like me until he got his heart broken badly in NS when his girlfriend cheated on him.

98161,"I proposed divorce to be banned. coz i dont believe in second chances. U made a bad choice u stick with it till you die.Furthermore, this will improve divorce stats to zero sharply.Yes, there will be physical and mental abuse committed by both sides (battered men and women, hospital admissions), but isnt that the point of marriage? Life is about the luck of the draw. Kids born to quarrelling families simply have bad luck. It is not our duty to assuage the suffering of those kids. But if they are good, the daily quarrel will strengthen them. The best steel is forged in the hottest furnace.In conclusion, divorce shld be banned coz not because of the sanctity of the institution of marriage (this is hogwash) but because of practical concerns.

Frankly I thought engineering kids can't speak or write to save their lives but this one's right at home writing FASS term papers as well.I've only been in a couple classes with him, but like he's really, really, like unreasonably smart. Everyone that I know that knows him as well has nothing but good things to say about him and like remember I said it looked like minimal effort on his part? Well apparently they all say he's bloody hardworking. Go figure.He's always at the U-Town Gym between classes (before COVID) with his friends, and yeah like I know his friends are doing well, but like it never occurred to me he was doing well also? He's not even like buff just like small body frame, and like idk this kind of guy is my type just that he in specific makes no sense to me, and like how he lives his life is confusing and I feel like it's insulting? Like wait hear me out.He's graduating this year, and I heard he secured a job in NUS.I'm not sure if the job economy is really *that* terrible out there but I'm pretty sure he shouldn't have problems finding an even better paying job? I'm not sure what's in it for him to stick around in NUS, and if he wants to go on to do further studies I'm sure with his results and multiple Dean's Lists he can apply to any scholarship - and like given his track record he's not going to find writing an essay for them too hard.So like for the life of me I can't figure out why people who basically get all the good luck end up squandering it just like that. I'd burn and drink textbooks to get his CAP and I just don't understand what everyone sees in him - frankly if you didn't tell me he was FCH and stuff I'd have pegged him as the course gym-going slacker (you get the idea- forever in the gym and never doing work). It's like he goes out of his way to be invisible but like that doesn't make sense because then he's apparently doing so well it should be impossible to be this inconspicuous.Guys if you do well in school and do well in life please do make the most of it, because frankly all you're doing if you waste it is insulting for everyone who can't do as well as you. If overqualified people take the jobs meant for the us common people, then all that means is that the ""good"" jobs are left with people who are underqualified and basically we the peasants get nothing in an already terrible job market.-#98160: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98160","['Like: 7 people', 'Wow: 1 person']",10 Comments,0 Shares

98150,"I used to despise fboys and thought that they have a very selfish perspective on relationship, treating women as trophies. However, I made friends with a fboy and came to know more about their thinking. Initially, I had a bad impression of him because he would often brag about his sexual encounters. He would brag about cheating on his girlfriend and said that once his girlfriend kept coming back to him despite his cheating because he was charming. I felt angry when he was bragging about it but now to think of it, I was being jealous of him. As a friend, he is a loyal bro, often saying things like “I got your back” and “I will never touch my bro’s women”.I used to a simp and very naïve believing in true love. Looks does not matter, what matter is you have a good character. But apparently that is just a lie to comfort those beta males. The world is a cruel place, and kindness does not pay. You must be ruthless to fight for what you want. I heard some guys becames fboys after being hurt badly in their first relationships after they got played. Girls want someone who will go out of their way to defend their rights, not someone who is kind and spend their time helping others. If you do not believe, most women will not agree to let their husband lend a large sum of money to help their bros. 80% of the women go for the top 20% of men and women will keep cheating to find the alpha male. In Japan, 60% of the women cheat on their partners. Monogamy is a lie. We are polyamorous. Evolutionary speaking, it is more advantageous for men to have multiple sex partner to increase their reproductive chances. In fact, it is normal for men to cheat. To men, we can detach emotional from sex. In NS, we can often hear about encik visiting prostitutes on their overseas mission. There are many cases of men sleeping outside, but still not neglecting their families. To be honest, does it matter a guy sleep outside as long as no one knows. Sometimes, ignorance is bliss. I often see people bashing confessions about cheating saying that their partner deserves better and asking them to confess and leave their partner, but I find it pointless. So what if the truth is known? It will only hurt the other party. The commenters are only saying to make themselves look better. Doesn’t everyone keep secrets in their relationship? Who is going to be responsible for their relationship and well-being? Now that I have seen through the illusion of true love, I see no reason to hate on fboys. People who do that are probably those who are jealous of their success and unwilling to accept the harsh reality. The fboy thinking is actually correct, those hoes ain’t loyal. Relationships are just about being able to provide what the other party wants.

Writing stuff like “I’m annoyed with xx” “I’ve no more patience and sympathy for xx” “I can’t find it in me to care about xx anymore“ “I need to avoid xx for a bit” etc. She dates her entries and when I compare the date/time of them to her messages to me, right after each badmouth entry, she sends some kind and loving text to see if I been ok.

Were you the one who compromised just to stop the fight?*What do you lose if you breakup with Guy A, you are lucky there is a Guy B ready as your ""spare tire""*Is Guy A willing to drop what he is doing if you need him?

98133,"To the OP who had a fallout with his/her parents or anyone in situations that cannot be changed.I have found these tricks useful in dissolving my own internal conflict. It may not solve the problem but at least made me at peace.1) satisfy yourself at 60% and then others (including parents/children) at 40%. Do not go the other way around (mothers tend to) and make yourself bitter and everyone bears the brunt. This 60-40 rule can be applied even for 2 mins. Imagine your kids are making a huge mess and the laundry is piling etc. Ask yourself how can I satisfy myself using the 60-40 rule in this very minute. Practice and slowly expand it into larger time chunks. For instance June holidays. How can I plan my schedule, work full time, do housework and care for the children all at the same time using the 60-40 rule? One way would be to offload some chores to your husband. If your husband refuse to help, ask him to hire a helper. If he refuses to help and refuses to help pay for the helper then either pay for the helper yourself or maybe learn to live with a messier house. Do things your way to the best of the situation.2) when 1) does not work. You try to make the best of the situation and still you can't get over it. I am a Buddhist. Buddhist teach karma. My mum says hurtful things. I used to get upset but not anymore. I tell myself that I owe her some karmic debt and must pay back this life. So I suck it up.Be careful not to over include problems as karma. How do you determine karma? Simple. A persistent problem is a sign of karma. E. G. Difficult relationships, problematic character flaw, constant financial woes.Whether karma exist or not is not the question here. These 2 ways are merely methods to help you become at peace.What's the benefit or making a scene? The one who caused the scene is always the one left worst off.. Yes not worse off but worst off. Bcus that person will feel worse off than before and carry the shame of causing a scene.-#98133: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98133","['Like: 6 people', 'Wow: 2 people']",0 Comments,4 Shares

98126,"To the girl who posted about the loss of sex drive after breakup: I'm not sure if it is common among females but I experienced the same thing too. I've experienced phases of very fluctuating sex drive throughout my dating life and at times questioned the same as you. I've come to realize sometimes it has less to do with the physical performance and more with the psychological triggers you felt in the relationship. Also, our female hormones seem to play roulette on our lives quite often too. An experienced partner may know how to trigger and turn you on. But I would say it is good to explore yourself too, so your pleasure is not so dependent on others and will not seem like a hit and miss game. Guys are very good at this and they learned since early what they enjoy, hence they seem to have more stable sex drive. While we usually don't self-explore enough and hence rely more on the external factors to determine our sex drive instead of triggering it ourselves. About myself: since my last breakup I went through a ""dry"" period with low sex drive, then I got curious and started to experiment more with myself and I would say I'm more sexually active than ever, with or without a partner  Good luck.-#98126: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98126",['Like: 4 people'],2 Comments,0 Shares

Me and A are just normal friends and we would occasionally text to play sports and just talk (no flirting was involved). Z got really offended and unhappy that I did not take her feelings into consideration and went to play sports with A but it was always with my other group of friends. Z would ask me out for drinks and I would go but Z would give me attitude and did not told me what is wrong. I had to find out myself.

98124,"I was in a relationship with my ex for around 3 years; and we have been through many up and down and I told myself, I will stay through regardless.The issues that we always have disagreement about is that my ex would text his bestfriend on a daily basis when we were together and meet his bestfriend once or twice a year and as much as I hate it, I got so tired of the arguements I would say I’m fine and let them meet. His bestfriend is his first love.. Whenever he gamble and lose money, he would blame it on me when I didn’t do anything wrong and we would argue all day long. Who wouldn’t stand up for themself for something they didn’t do?Honestly, I am not the perfect girl out there, i’m just a 5/10 based on looks and personality wise I still have a million things to work on. Throughout the entire rs with him, I have learnt so much about my flaws and especially: - I had a terrible abusive childhood and I cannot control my temper and would get really mad and all and whenever I got shouted at, I couldn’t help it but hurt myself and I know that I am really hard to handle at the start, but now I changed it. - I cry really easily and up to the point whereby he gave up and whenever I cry he would just ask me why do you cry so easily, what are you doing or just leave me alone to cry but I can’t blame him for not understanding that i’m emotional. I would get unhappy with the fact that he wouldn’t come over to me when I’m crying but he would say that when he is angry he won’t do that I have to accept that he is like that and I’m expecting too much.Honestly, the arguments are so minor that I felt that as we both grow older we can mature up together. He was the first guy I imagined a future with. There was more good than bad  but however, the reason why we broke up was because even when we were in a rs, he secretly flirt with girls behind my back on instagram and download dating apps as well. To me, that’s cheating and I cannot accept that even though this is incomparable to those physical cheating cases out there but it still shuts my entire confidence and beliefs in love down.

98122,"In response to the slut-shaming to post #97886 There are too many individuals who seem to think that they are entitled to name-calling without understanding a person’s story as well as the motivations behind their actions, as such I hope that perhaps reading this allows one to reconsider the very nature of judgement itself. Now, moving on to what the OP did: I think it would be fair to acknowledge that she has not only battled the feelings of lust but also tried to find an outlet on NUSWhispers to seek advice/rant and not once has she mentioned that she has committed the actual act of cheating on her current partner. Allow me to explain why her feelings of lust are not logically wrong. Dawn Maslar, a biologist professor mentions on her TED talk that the science of attraction is one that is based upon a chemical reaction. Lust is a feeling that is caused by both Testosterone and Estrogen in female and male bodies. Testosterone, while commonly mistaken for being a ‘male-only’ hormone, can be found in both female and male bodies and increases the sex drive in almost anyone upon the trigger of their 5 senses. As such, on the premise of science, can anyone still really blame one for having these feelings of lust? In fact, the moral penal code itself highlights varying levels of mens rea (intentions when committing the crime), and given that the thoughts of lust were purely in the OP’s head and actions were not taken, in the eyes of the law the OP is a free woman. Especially in accordance with the theory of concurrence, as the OP’s feelings of shame had prevented her from committing the actual physical act of cheating (actus rea), the OP’s act of abstaining from the physical act of cheating itself should be highly commendable.  Note that the OP mentioned in her very last line that she detests her thoughts of cheating. This indicates an acknowledgement on the OP’s part on the lack of morality of cheating itself. She knows cheating is wrong, and she even hates herself for thinking it. This is indicative of the moral state of the accused OP – she not only understood that her thoughts were wrong but she also had the self-restraint to withhold from committing the actual act of cheating. As such, how is it fair to condemn her for being a slut? While thinking of cheating itself might be a mental crime, it is perhaps a flaw in the law that mental crimes are perhaps the most difficult to convict. But honestly how many Jean Greys do we need to have in society to whistleblow? This then brings us to the moral question that extends from the very premise of what a ‘mental crime’ is. In fact, even masturbation itself could be considered as a mental crime, given that it requires some form of sexual stimulation (i.e mental, physical or emotional etc.) and coupled with the act of ‘mentally’ having intercourse or engaging in a sexual act with the person or persons of choice of whom one might not necessarily be in a relationship with. Consequently, is masturbation within the boundaries of a relationship wrong? Also if and when the individual engages in the act of masturbation towards a person of desire of whom he/her is not in a relationship with is it then wrong? A convenient paraphrase to this question might be - is it wrong to watch my favourite pornstar and get off? This is very much a question to be answered by both parties within the relationship. Some might find it alright, others might then deem it as a mental crime that is unforgivable. But the hard truth is that we are all humans powered by the basic instinct to procreate and are attracted by attractive things. If we are going to get real here and start dissing individuals for the numerous ‘mental crimes’ committed in their heads instead of taking constructive steps towards encouraging an individual who is already facing extant conflicting feelings of lust - there ought to be more shade being thrown upon these people who simply perceive situations at face value and decide to slut shame and name call. In fact, to take things into perspective, since lust is a mere feeling not only substantiated by science but also unable to be charged for in the eyes of the law, how is it that we as human beings somehow feel licensed to judge others for how they feel? Moreover, in accordance with this line of reasoning of it being alright to judge emotions, it is then fair to judge someone for feeling happy? Feeling sad? and the list goes on. The world itself is a dark enough place that operates on more than fifty shades of lust. Take for instance: The Bill Cliton affair with his young intern, the curious open marriage of Warren Buffett and the undeniable fact that Bill Gates kept his ex Ann Winblad close to him despite being married.In that light, there are numerous issues that toe the line when it comes to moral justice. But as a patron on NUSWhispers, it would be nice to have a baseline of moral decency and basic social grace to not appear like an ignorant name-calling fool before delving into the motivations behind an individual’s actions. Moreover, many might not understand that the power of name-calling is one that seems to condemn the one being named, but truly damns the namer. While there is an arguably a sick satisfaction in anger venting or whatever negative emotion being released in the process of calling someone a slut, the person who has been called a slut (the one being named) is not the only person being judged in the process. As the person calling ‘slut’ (the namer), might possibly be viewed by others as an aggressor and one who has an energy that is hardly positive as the general consensus of people who choose to name call are often that of persons who fail to examine beyond the surface.But if and when anyone would like to name-call, it would then be appropriate for one to be sure of the exact consequences of name-calling itself - not just to the one being name-called but also to the namer.-#98122: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98122",['Like: 4 people'],2 Comments,0 Shares

It has been more than a week since we last confirmed the plan and today my in-laws demanded that me and my husband go over to their place on the same day and cancel my plans. This is not the first time I had to cancel the plans that I have made with my friends just to attend their family dinner. Throughout our relationship I have never once been absent for any family gathering. I have drifted apart from some friends over the years due to differences in schedules and I also had to always cancel on them because of my in-laws' demanding behaviors. Tbh I feel bad about it.Last month I just had a talk with my husband regarding this when he asked why I haven't been meeting up with my friends. I was really disappointed that he didn't side with me this time. When any of their family members are not free, it's fine and they can just either postpone the date or go ahead without that person. But when it comes to me, nobody ever bothers to ask if I already had plans and demands me to prioritize them again and again. My in-laws are traditional people and they always emphasize that married women should prioritize her husband and in-laws. There was once when I was late for a dinner due to work and my in-laws sarcastically asked 'you're very busy hor?' But whenever they are late or suddenly cancel the dinner the day before when they have already made me cancel my plans, nobody bats an eye. If it was just any random meetup with a friend I would have sucked it up but it's my best friend's special occasion and I want to be there to celebrate for her.Married women, how do y'all handle situations like this when your in laws don't respect your time and personal life?-#98118: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98118","['Like: 11 people', 'Care: 4 people', 'Sad: 1 person']",24 Comments,1 Share

98108,"For Science students doing UROPs, be it to fulfil a programme requirement or for learning, please choose your supervisor wisely. You might have heard this before, but your choice of supervisor determines your grade. I had the misfortune of getting a D grade for my UROP project, which was unheard of. To me, a D grade warrants an incomplete report or failure to respond intelligently during the viva, and I recall neither on my part. It was extremely discouraging and infuriating to see long hours spent writing a 30-page report leading up to a failing grade.Some red flags to look out for: 1. the supervisor does not know the official process of submitting the project (which is through the UROPs portal that must be accessed using NUS VPN); 2. the supervisor disregards meeting time with you due to an ongoing meeting without informing you; 3. the supervisor offloads the entire instructional process to a postgrad/research assistant; 4. the supervisor does not even send you a reminder to submit the report or conduct the viva before the deadline;5. the supervisor does not find a proper external assessor (another prof) or prompt you to do if s/he is busy.Looking back, I should not have pushed to get the UROPs done with this principal investigator (PI), heeded the early red flags, and found a more responsible and engaged PI. Before signing up, I should have asked anyone possible for the PI's reputation as a teacher and researcher to arrive at an estimation of his character. I recognise my faults in not being fully committed to UROP, but my biggest mistake was giving in to desperation to fulfil an academic requirement by this semester - a lapse of wise judgement on my part.I have submitted an appeal to review the result for this UROP. However, I doubt it will change anything.

98103,"I have a question about blind rage. I don't know whether that's the correct term for it but maybe those with pschology background or have good relationship related wisdom can correct me.I get that in relationships people get upset and fight for things. Usually these fights are to make a certain aspect of the relationship better and they can get quite passionate and heated. Not ideal but hey, at least it is all for a good cause.The reason I ask about blind rage is I think my girlfriend switches into a different mode when angry. She will change topic multiple times, not respond to anything I say, and just blindly say things, scream, insult me and say all sorts of untrue things. It is like her goal is to inflict maximum damage, pain and hurt to me. Mind you this is not just for 5 minutes, it can last 2 weeks sort. Funny thing is probably 30 minutes in, she already forgot what she was fighting about, she just wants to fight for the sake of fighting. It is like some sort of vengeance thing, definitely not constructive, and definitely not for any cause or change she is passionate about. That's what I call blind rage.Almost everything the catalyst for this blind rage or should I say almost all our fights, is her being angry that I am upset or hurt by something she said or did. My girlfriend constantly tells me things like she is a very kind person, she is a person of good character. I find that very weird, like who says this kind of things, it is like she wants to label herself that way desperately. So I think if I tell her she did or said something unkind to me, that sort of threatens her self identity if that makes sense? This then becomes a sort of reflexive defense mechanism for her? I am no psychologist but 3 years of observing this has more or less convinced me this is what is happening.Sad part is I still don't know how to deal with her blind rage. Maybe if anyone knows the correct terminology for it, the internet can give me some ideas if it is a well studied mental condition. Of course any advice to make the situation better is also always welcome.-#98103: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98103",['No Reactions'],0 Comments,0 Shares

98101,"I started to date recently after being single for awhile. I am surprised how tolling a relationship could actually feel. I do like my bf that's why i decided to take the step and get into a relationship with him, however I feel like there's a difference in synergy.On his end, he really hopes that we can meet up as many times as we can, and spend more time together, which personally I do find that there's nothing wrong, since I also find that it's supposed to be normal to want to see/spend time with your S.O. On my end, I think it is also fine even if we don't meet up each other very often - we are both working adults and sometimes it is a little difficult to cater to the timing since my work ends slightly later than usual; but if we do make the plans to meet, I will definitely set aside my time to do so. In addition, as I do still have my other priorities (example family/religion) which I will place before our relationship, if the meetups were to fall on those dates, I made sure to suggest and commit for a different day if possible. This had also been communicated to him before, but overall i still get an inkling where he feels disregarded because of that (though he never explicitly mentioned), and I get afraid that he will misunderstand that I do not put in the effort to make the relationship work. And also on the other hand, I also feel tired pushing myself to go out on dates for long hours every week. But what can I do, I also want to make it work between us, so I still got to put in the effort on my end.We text daily as couples usually do, but sometimes I get uncomfortable when his text seems to insinuate sexual advances. He will mention about he misses me and can't wait to hug me/do ""naughty things"" etc. To set the record, I am okay with spending some physical time when we are together face to face, but I don't like to read about it in text, and I don't know how to respond to that. So when I read that, I just feel turned off and my replies subsequently will get very 敷衍 (""Perfunctory""), like ""Oh. Okay haha"". Which then again I will get worried that he thinks I'm not putting in the effort. I could see from his standpoint why he would send that to me, his love language is physical touch, and this form of writing is also his way of expressing that he loves and cares about me, but I feel uncomfortable about that way of expression... To me, just a ""I miss you, baby"" is sweet enough, and anything after that can be omitted to when we meet face to face. Otherwise I just feel like an object of sexual gratification lol. I am slightly hesitant to tell him about it because there was once where I offered my POV for a certain action via text, he did not took it very well immediately and felt like that was a form of rejection, of course after a night of rest, we managed to sort it out in the day. But it makes me feel like I will need to be very tactful in expressing my views on the issue, without making it sound like a rejection. So I had yet to tell him about this yet, still formulating a reply to either talk about this the next time he text me something similar, or to save it till we meet face to face.Really not sure if I'm thinking too much into this.-#98101: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98101",['No Reactions'],1 Comment,1 Share
98095,"As a graduate of NUS who has entered into the workforce several years ago, I must say I am highly disappointed with the quality of interns that I am getting from one of our fellow local universities. While a student in NUS, I often felt there was comparisons drawn between ourselves and students from this said university - let’s call it University X. We were told, as students, that graduates of University X were arguably more charismatic, “hungry” for progression, had more quality presentation skills and overall better EQ. It was often the “coffeeshop” banter that NUS students, while strong in their academic quotient, may lack in EQ compared to their peers of University X. Now, I have had a string of interns from University X who have been assigned to our team, and I must say the experience has been exhausting at the very least.Out of many other observations, my biggest call out is the lack of respect and formalities - I’m all for a flat hierarchy, but that does not mean I place no importance on the value of respect to others. I think interns from this University seem to lack an understanding as to who is their “friend” and who is their “supervisior”. Call it what you will, but a flat hierarchy is more of a way of working - it does not negate the idea that we have an actual organisation structure in place with reporting lines. Simply put, they do not know when to put forward a professional front, and when to be appropriately casual. It is just a bit absurd to expect us at our mid management level to train someone who is an adult, in their 20s, on the basics of professional behaviour. Calling me your “pal” or “bud” when I’m your boss, sadly, does not fly. I’m not impressed by the “smoke and mirrors” of this said charming demeanour, when I feel it is a way to mask an obvious ineptitude in work quality. I have had interns from NUS, foreign universities and private universities who have never tried to skirt around this professional border, and always remained humble for learning and understanding.Disclaimer, this are views of my own experiences and I obviously know that not all students of this university behave this way. But I am just very upset that we NUS students were constantly belittled and compared to these peers of ours, when I have unfortunately yet to be impressed or proven wrong in my own experiences.My takeaway - give NUS students the recognition they deserve, and put a halt to this unnecessary comparison between us and those from University X.-#98095: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98095","['Like: 45 people', 'Haha: 13 people']",12 Comments,5 Shares
98092,"Tl;dr Born in a well-to-do family left me with an crooked view of money.My parents are business owners and they’re relatively well to do. They taught me to be humble and kept telling me “We’re really not rich.” since I was young and that’s how I acted during Sec and JC. I have been a good student, admitted to a high demand course in NUS, everything went smooth. People often say we can get a “prestigious high-flyer” job after I graduate. However, half way through my course, I realised the so called “prestigious jobs” did not offer as much as I thought. Put it this way, my parents claimed “We’re just normal middle class, by no means rich.” That puts an investment banking or FAANG salary+bonus+stocks at “poverty” level, at least for the first 15-20 years, unless you become an MD in the US. Even the career end-point salary (when reaching 40-50) is not as much as what I am used to.  My parents are proud that they achieved everything without my grandparents’ help, though my grandparents are pretty successful too. They expected me to be independent after graduation, which I had nothing against. I felt anxious and started to run my own business, from investors to investors. The precious takeaway from my parents was that I learnt how business owners think and how to avoid being cheated or scammed when doing things. This was the first time also, that I stopped caring about my grades. It is quite ironic that person who doesn’t need money is now worrying about $$$ the most, while my friends are enjoying their life in University. Some simply concluded my little success to “Of course parents money lah”. But that didn’t affect me and I had too little time to care. Not to sound like an asshole, but sometimes being born into a normal or below average family is a blessing.

He was I'd say very above average in bedroom-relevant size and I mean even though it was somewhat too large I still enjoyed myself in bed with him most times.After breaking up with him I seem to have lost almost all interest in sex, to the point where my last boyfriend complained that I was a tease and never in the mood. I kinda understand his point of view since I was really rarely in the mood and I think we always ended it with a blowjob, so I'm really worried going into my next relationship if having an abnormally low sex drive is acceptable? Or is there something wrong with me  I just don't get why I'm never in the mood now especially since I'm way less stressed now when I'm going to graduate compared to like before A levels and trying to get into uni.

I spent around 50 plus montly for transportation, 250 for food n about another 50 for other stuff. This totals to 350 per month. Is this considered as too much? I know i spend a lot on food.

But not THAT bad that I lost a limb or wheelchair bound. So, I still have a job and yearly appraisals were Meet Expectation. With the accident, I gave up all hope for promotion and was just very thankful that I still had a job. However, lately, I was told by my senior manager (or my boss, for want of a better word) that they (including my teammates) felt my stress and displeasure at my job. This was a great surprise to me as I neither felt stressed not displeasure. I am contented. Apparently, they feel that I am being paid 'too much' for the work I do. Never mind that I work longer hours (at my own cost...read: no OT or off-in-lieu) just to ensure that my work is done for the day. And organisations willing to accept 'disabled' persons? They do not exist. A person who is wheelchair bound or who has lost a limb stand a better chance of landing a job.

A is quite attractive, can be considered quite extroverted, have a few fwbs. B, on the other hand is very introverted, but hopes to be like A. Hence B looked up to A and kind of adapted her style. Since girl A is adored by a few men on tinder, girl B wished to be validated by men as well. Didnt end well, girl A indirected girl B and so onnnnnnnnn - they broke friendship Girl A, B and a few other friends including me used to be close, but we split. So now Girl A and i are in the same group project. But because no one wants to take the lead, i made and effort to put things in the right place. When we met up to do things in school, i presume girl A felt left out as she was always using her phone texting her bf. Hence for the whole day, girl A was in a bad mood and snapped at all my group mates to not disturb her. I left her alone because i wanted to finish the project fast so everyone can go home. Fast forward again, i texted her about her using too much phone and ask her to apologise and she did, but continuously indirected me a few times on instagram on how ‘i wasnt understanding towards her’ just because her time of the month is coming. Am i really not understanding enough? did i handle it the right way? Do i really not have the leadership ability? But i ultimately did not want to ‘wear the shoe even if it fits’ , i did not indirect back and chose to act like it doesnt bother me. she made year 2 of poly so hard for me as she’s one of my close friend and we’re going to be in the same group for the rest of the year. lecturers dont help at this point and i dont want to put the rest of my friends in the tight spot. but i would like advise on how i shouldve handled better because these are immature problems that i could have not care but unfortunately, happens in my friend group :”)-#98070: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98070","['Care: 2 people', 'Like: 1 person', 'Haha: 1 person']",10 Comments,0 Shares
98072,"Am the person behind #98031, thanks for all the advice given. Kinda gave me the motivation to really work hard to save. I do freelance on the side too (I'm a creative) but because I'm such a junior in the industry, I barely get any clients, and even when I do, I have to lower my prices for someone to engage my service. But, whatevs, I still try my best and I try really hard to save. Like now that we are working from home, I often just buy cheap groceries and cook two meals a day, skipping breakfast. During CB I managed to save a 1.5k a month, but because I'm so bad with self-control, I ended up spending half of my measly savings on delivery food. Stupid.I actually put away $700 every month to save first and plan my finances according to whatever's left after deducting away the things I have to pay for. I ever tried asking my parents if I can defer giving allowance first but they weren't too happy with it, which is why I can only suck thumb and continue to contribute to family expenses. As for marriage, I really wanted to get marry early, maybe in 3-4 years time because both my bf and I don't fancy very happening weddings, we just wanna ROM and that's it, but I guess I had my priorities wrong. Also, he's actually pretty rich, he's just really thrifty, to the point where $5 takeaway food from the hawker centre is also expensive to him. I ever asked him if he could lend me some money to at least clear half my debt and he was pretty willing but I got a scolding from my parents and grandparents cos they said it's not nice to ask my bf for money when we're not married.In the end, my bf only has like 2-3k cash flow now cos all his money is in his endowment plan, investments, crypto and all that stuff lols. Don't need any advice this time, I guess I'll figure it out as long as I continue to be thrifty and careful with my money, but I just needed to get this off my chest, thanks bros and sis.Just wanna say that this all sux.

98071,Graduated from NUS in 2020 and had been working for about close to a year now. I want to start investing some money to grow my savings further and for future retirement purposes. I have zero investing b/g and not from biz/finance related degree but I do google and research online but there are far too many terminologies and types of investments which causes me to be overwhelmed by all the information. I am very prudent and have the habit of saving about half of my monthly salary (not alot only 3K+). I don't have any major commitments at the moment. My peers are also facing similar issues as me... I read that first timers should buy SSB as they are low risk. I am not a massive risk taker (e.g crypto) as I don't wish to see my hard earn money gone just like that but at the same time I also want my money to grow instead of just leaving it in multiplier savings account. Any experienced people or those who once been in my position willing to advise on how a beginner should proceed from here?

98067,"(Serious post: trolls expected but less, hopefully... please?)(29,M)Does anyone know if SDN events are useful and what is it like, or where I can try meeting people during COVID? I've tried dating apps for a couple of years and don't really see it going anywhere. Being a returning Singaporean, I don't have many friends locally and I don't want to try finding romance in my workplace so as to keep work and personal life apart. I'm also rather romantically unexperienced, having only had a very short relationship before in universityAbout myself for context: Graduated from a top university in Japan, I work in finance with a rather high pay, and also own my own property. I think I'm average looking with an average height and weight, quite introverted. I was a nerd in school but a sporty nerd, being in some athletic teams.I do get matches but it's nearly impossible to keep conversations going. Some are boring, some are outright creepy. I don't sext or anything, because I'm looking for a serious relationship. Most of the profiles (my age bracket) also do seem to have put in rather low effort: no descriptions ; horrible grammar/spelling; or one-liners like ""ask me yourself"" or ""I'm a potato"" (what???). I've even seen stuff like ""marry me pls if you're Lee Min Ho"", as well as dozens of insurance agents.For those where we made it to a date, it seems like some of them want dates to be absolutely perfect like some korean drama and they need to know if the person they are meeting is Mr Right just on the first date. Like some of them would compare our date to what they see their friends having on IG, and tell me, ""oh my friend's boyfriend brought her to xxxxx"" (I'm not even your boyfriend yet!) If it matters, I've always paid for or offered to pay for the first date, and turned up early to scout around. Even for those dates that turned out fine, she eventually ghosts me or I ghost them because I find them too talkative or clingy.I'm starting to feel the pressure to find my life partner because I see my friends getting married or welcoming children into their families, but I don't want to compromise either. I recently spoke with my ex-classmate who asked if I'm still single and when he could come to my wedding.If there is anyone else who lived overseas like me and doesn't have a strong ""Singapore network"" and could share some tips with me, I would be very grateful.

Words are cheap and people don't often follow through with what they say.This notion has been perpetuated by the actions of others in society which I have personally observed. I realised that we should never have to rely on others to help with out problems, much less even tell them about it. Most of the comments here prove just that, people care about their own entertainment first and put their own beliefs above others instead of repectfully engaging in a discussion. These are the very same people who would be likely be the first to complain when put on the receiving end of such an action, complaining about the lack of emphathy when it is they who are also part of the problem.

98060,"This is something I would like to rant about for the first time in 4 years of studying at NUS as an international student. First of all, I know y'all don't have a very good feeling toward international students and I perfectly understand that. And I also fully understand that international students are not the school's priority. So please don't bother with those comments because I don't give 2 shits about how yall feel about intl' students.But I think there is a certain line of respect that the school have to show to their students even if they are an international student. For those of you who don't know; all the intl students are like sitting ducks rn because the school haven't released whether it will be online or offline next sem. Yall might think what's the big deal about it and tbh for locals, it isn't much of a problem. But for intl students, it means we can't decide whether to stay in Singapore or go back to our home country and we have to wait on our expensive housing contract of at least 1k+ until the school makes a decision. You might say ""you can work during the hols to make up for it."" Well right now due to government policy, firms are simply not hiring intl students except for very special cases. You might say ""just take LOA"" but as an intl student, there is a VISA complication if you take LOA (I didn't know as well until I was told by CFG). So yeah the situation is tough for us but the only thing the school is saying is simply ""there is nothing we can do.""I know for sure at least one of you will say ""if you got an issue go back to your own country la, no one asked you to come here to take our job."" and I understand where that is coming from but that is not the point here.What I expect from the school is at least help the international students with the accommodation or at least announce that the exams and lessons will be done in an online format so we have an option to go back and don't waste our money.Sorry for the long post; I just wanted to rant about it since I am getting too depressed. If you know a solution or any info that can help please let me know!tldr:1. school nvr release online or offline next sem2. intl students have to sit on housing contract till school make decision3. school ain't doing jack shit about it-#98060: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98060","['Like: 16 people', 'Care: 11 people', 'Haha: 3 people']",6 Comments,4 Shares

98038,"In 2016, my poly classmates went for overseas programme and they got to know a senior. When we returned to school, we had lesson right after his at the same venue and my classmates introduced him to the rest of us. Besides that, I ran into him in school at different venues almost everyday (Coincidence 1). We started from a simple ""Hello/Bye Bye"" to a causal conversation and following each other on IG. I had a crush on him but I got to know that he had a girlfriend from his IG posts. I followed his posts and stories closely. I also got to know that we interned at the same location but different companies (Coincidence 2). After we graduated, I thought that it was impossible and hence I stopped thinking about him. Little did I expect to run into him again but in a different school. We were both in NUS (Coincidence 3). He initiated a conversation with me and we began to chat with each other occasionally on Telegram. He was still with his Girlfriend at that point of time. While chatting with him, I asked if his Girlfriend would mind that he kept chatting with other girls like me and he replied no. Recently, I'm doing my internship. As for him, he graduated and is working full-time. We increased our conversations by talking about our work. One day, he messaged me that he felt heartbroken because he broke up with his Girlfriend after so many years together because of her family issues. A few days later, he also told me that he let her go easily and he recovered from the break up very quickly (Question 1: Why did he let me know all these information?). Nevertheless, we began to chat even more till it became an everyday thing and I felt really drawn to him. Soon he kept asking me to go out with him (Question 2: Does he like me back? I am a plain looking girl who never date before. He admitted too. So I don't know if I will ever be liked by someone a not.). In fact I would like to go out with him so badly and I can't stop thinking of ways to meet him every night. Due to Covid-19 and being the only child, my parents want me to stay at home as much as possible, not to hang out with my friends because we never know who they are in contact with and they may be Covid-19 carrier. Furthermore, I hardly go out with any of my friends. Wait, do I even have friends? ???????????????????????? I understand my parents' concerns but they are too extreme.

I went into whatever job I could find immediately after graduating because my parents don't give me allowance and I pay for all my expenses myself. As a fresh grad, it's kinda crazy how now they won't even pay you more than 2.5k, I jumped ship 2 times and finally got my pay to increase $200. From young, I was never thought to save, and when I finally did ask my parents to bank in money for me, they took it instead, and I never knew where my money went. I have close to 0 savings now because I contribute heavily to my family's expenses + my own expenses.

I want to get married soon because I don't like staying with my parents, they drive me crazy and they favour my siblings over me anyways so I just want to marry my bf and move out asap, but I have to first pay off my school fees.

How many other people out there actually cheated on their partner, tortured their partner, or other people for that matter, and still walk free, as though they've done nothing wrong? Truly thankful for the few who actually gave constructive feedback though, it warmed my heart and I'm going to seek therapy for this.To those who called me a slut, told me I belonged to the streets, what are you? How great are you that you have the rights to insult me without knowing me and my full story? Who are you to judge me? When those thoughts surface, I force myself to not think of it, I distract myself, and I try my hardest to stop thinking of that guy I met. Do you see that? You don't. The person who told me not to use the word love again, maybe after all that I've gone through, I know the word love more than you will ever know. I come from a broken family, I got raped, played by men, degraded, insulted, and trampled on, and now that I finally met a guy who truly loved me, even when I was so undeserving of his love, he taught me how to be a good person, he picked me up, and his selfless love really pushes me to change.

98015,"Not sure if this Confession makes sense. Not sure if I need any advise even. Just something that has been bothering me. I am a guy. Few years back, hooked up with a girl in club. That was my first time about to have sex. She was pretty, figure was above average as well. Checked into hotel, excited, nervous, felt like a king inside. After foreplay, did I manage to have sex? No. I tried. I was hurting. My foreskin was not fully able to retract. I stop the session and apologies to her. She laughed and we just hug each other to sleep. Whole night we have been kissing. That’s pretty much it. We exchange numbers and kept in contact. Texted each other everyday. After that incident, I retract my foreskin fully, so that I can have sex with her LOL. Subsequently, we became FWB. Soon, we decided to do things other than sex. Movies, shopping, cafe dates etc, basically what couples do. I enjoyed every moment with her, I then realised I fell for her. Did I confess to her during that time, Yes. Did she became my gf. No. Various reasons, time not right, she enjoys this moment etc. Our relationship ended close to 2 years. How did it end, she told me we need to stop this as she got pregnant. The baby was not mine. She was certain. She even show me the blood test report, was with another guy. I was heartbroken. At that point of time, I hoped it would be mine. I even told her to get an abortion. All kinds of reason to keep her. She was unwilling. Our relationship came to an end. She got married eventually.Fast forward today. I am actually in a relationship for 2 years. A loving girlfriend. More pretty and hot than my first and only FWB. Both of us have good income, good vibes, good relationship. I can foresee starting a family with her in the near future. However, just a part of me here and there reminds me of my FWB. I still check on her once every few months on ig or fb. I blocked her, but when I think of her I unblock and check on her. Every time I look at her photo, memories still lingers on. I know this is definitely not right. I know this is bad for sure. My best friends know this. They told me maybe it was my first sex, my first time in love. My first date. I did alot of first time with her. I do know that I got played by her. I was her sex toy or object wadever. I do know that my current girlfriend is 10x better in all aspect. But yea, just a part of me can’t forget this. Maybe like what my friend said, I did not have a good closure. My friend ask questions that stun me. “Would you be together with her or your current girlfriend given a chance”. “Would you do better to keep your FWB”. “Would you want to meet her for a closure?” I got so tempted to text her to ask her out. But nope I din’t. And never would I do that.That’s all guys. Just wanted to vent out my feelings. Sorry for the long post. Just another loser that falls in love with FWB and got played hahaha.

98013,"What do y'all ladies feel about no proposal before applying for bto? Call me traditional-minded, i have always wanted my other half to propose before we apply for a house together. Because my belief is that there needs to be a common spoken understanding and promise to each other first, before the subsequent step of looking for a home and leading our lives together.That would bring more sincerity, not just, ""eh want to bto?"" and consider it as proposal or propose after, which makes the whole knee-bending event less meaningful cuz will the girl say no when already in that proposition?Because of age, time constrain and a good location in this May launch, i decided to be practical and went ahead to apply for it.

97994,"Often we hear ""it takes a village to raise a child"". But what has happened to the vilage of today? Many people nowadays prefer less trouble because of the consequences should social media be involved, and maybe the hassle that comes with disciplining a child who has parents with an abundance of resources to come after you should their child feel a slight sense of unhappiness.Let's look at a very common example if you are willing to indulge in me:A child/teenager litters or drops food by accident (and decides he is not going to eat it anymore) and is schooled by an adult. Shouldn't the parent be thankful that someone is helping them to teach your child when they are not available? If the boy was asked to pick up the litter, and he doesn't, isn't it clear that the parent's teachings are not significant enough (if he was taught) for him to refuse/ignore the request? And if he was made to pick up the litter, but picks up only a fraction of those which could be picked up easily, isn't it blatantly obvious that he does not really know about the correct social behaviour (or even refuses to behave in that manner)?For me, as an educator, my job is to educate not just in terms of knowledge about the subjects I teach such as Math or Malay Language, but in terms of character as well. Let's say I were to encounter your son in the example above or even in some other examples of behavioural issues. These are the things I want to say to parents or parents-to-be:If I discipline your child, I mean well, and it will be in a way that your child will listen to and not just say ""yes"" and get back to his old ways almost instantaneously. If your child feels upset from his or her encounter with me because of things I say, I will say that is because your child has internalised what I have told them, which is why they will feel upset: because they will sorry about what they have done. If your child leaves the encounter aloof, it means the encounter has no effect on your child, and I will humbly admit that my talk with your child has no effect. If your child leaves the encounter happy, something must be wrong. If I bring you, as parents, into the picture, it is for your child to think about you and your family. Because for me to discipline a student that I have not seen or taught before, let's agree I will have no rapport, and the only way to make him consider about what I say is to invoke the connection he has with you. If I ask your child if you have taught your child on whether we should clean up after ourselves, I am not doubting what you have taught them, neither am I insinuating anything. I am just clarifying, because if you have taught him, I will question why is he not following your teachings? If you have not taught him, then I will teach him so he will know what to do the next time.Why do I say these? Because many parents are now seeing that they need to make up for the lack of time with their children by being their knights in shining armour. They jump to the defence of the child instantly and fault the teachers by twisting the words of teachers (or maybe the child twisted it). The moment I mention that child's parents, the parents imemdiately think they are being targetted (maybe because of a guilty conscience of not spending enough time with their child?) Take a moment to think about it: if teachers do not care, why would we bother ourselves with things that may subject ourselves to possible complaints? We are so busy all the time, why would we spend precious time disciplining a student that is not in our own form classes? Take another moment to think: if people can have many faces towards different people, can't your child act differently at home and in school?It does not help that some schools tend to be on the parents' side because schools function like businesses nowadays. ""The customer is always right"" attitude should never be adopted in schools. In short, teachers get thrown under the bus, and once the bus rolls over the teacher like a hump, the teacher has to crawl to the front of the bus and say, ""I'm sorry for making your journey an uncomfortable one.""I feel that the village has really died with the development of city life.Dear fellow whisperers, I implore all of you to educate this educator on what I should do.

For context, I am an Electrical Engineering student looking to do my FYP in the area of robotics. I understand the FYP topics for robotics related FYP can be pretty advanced so I wanted to know if it's necessary for me to know most of the prerequisite theory & literature needed for the FYP? Or do we just have to learn along as I do my FYP?I understand there is an extensive range of tools & softwares that robotics related work rely on, for example, Robot Operating System (ROS), OpenCV, etc. I know some basic machine learning concepts from my involvement in a robotics CCA but just found out from one of the robotics professors that some of his work involves building machine learning algorithms from scratch or from some existing models, but tweaking them to suit the research objectives.I am just concerned that such FYP topics may be well beyond my capabilities & not sure if such rigour is actually normal/common in students doing their FYPs?I am really keen on the field of robotics & am not one to chicken out on things that require hard work. I just want to be realistic about the workload of FYP & my capabilities too.Hope anyone out there may be able to shed some light on how FYP works! Thank you!TLDR: How does FYP work?

As a result of this problem, I have remain single even though I do like guys and they have tried to chase me too. Simply because I find it too awkward and tedious to date people. I do want to date though! Will these problem of mine disappear once I find “the one”, someone I naturally click with and actually want to hang out with all the time. Friends have advised me that I only dont want to go out with guys because I just dont “like” them enough. Is this true? Or is there something I should resolve about my apprehension to go out with guys alone?-#97957: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97957","['Like: 6 people', 'Wow: 2 people', 'Haha: 1 person']",8 Comments,3 Shares
97955,"Just curious, when guys see a girl wearing super nice branded clothes, using expensive bag and watch and so on, will guys think that the girl is very high maintenance? Like if guys are from humble backgrounds will they be less inclined to approach girls who look richly dressed ? Because as a female, when I see guys with really good fashion style and clothes, I do think that they look attractive but at the same time I am less likely to want to approach them because I will think that they are out of my league and maybe their spending habits too different from mine. Yeap just curious because I see people comment stuff telling guys to improve how they dress and so on to maximise their chances or even saw one comment asking the guy to just wear a rolex watch and girls will be more attracted (?) Is this true or am i just opposite from others? I prefer guys who dress simply in basic stuff.

97948,"I am a millennial currently taking a 10 minutes break from work, happy to jump onto the bandwagon to talk about the hot topic of toxic boomers and Generation XSo first, this is the storyline we were made to believe in. The Baby Boomers (and Gen X) were a great generation. Born out of the post war era, they seize the opportunities at hand and lay the foundations of our modern world. We as millennials should appreciate them for that. Boomers? Industrious, tough, resourceful. Millennials? Whiny, weak, attention seeking, strawberry, avocadoHere's a response, these are some of the observations on the boomers and Gen X folks, most were gathered from the internet and social media, the millennial's best friend:- They are usually entitled troublemakers: ""Do you have a badge?""- They tend to be xenophobic, racist and sexist: ""I am from Hwa Chong JC and will never mix around with you guys because we’re so different""- They are easily offended: ""I take embrage at your first question""- They are quite ungrateful: ""Give one chicken wing take back whole chicken""And then the topics escalates:- They created an education system that results in graduates enter the workforce with uni student loan ranging from $20k to $200k- They created a housing system where housing affordability is at an all time low for even our first home- They leave behind a sizeable carbon footprint: Enough to warm the earth by 1.7 degrees celsius but not the cockles of our heartsI (and I meant the internet) don't mean to generalize but hey, millennials are strawberries is a generalization too.No wonder we are all have a varying degree of depression and mental health issues. Pls seek help when necessary, do post on NUSWhispers for encouragement and filter out the unnecessary opinions from the trolls. You deserve better than from attention seeking boomers looking for validation on how 'smart' they are. They do not speak all boomers. My biggest worry is that the world that we would inherit one day is a messy one. There is an unprecedented amount of issues that we will need to tackle: Xenophobia, racism, climate change, human rights, global food shortage, ageing population, broken healthcare system, rising income gap and the list goes on. Even today, we are living through one of the biggest crisis of our lifetime with no end in sight. Of course, boomers are not to be blamed in entirety, we are merely 'part of the system'.On a more encouraging note, this is a call for rally for millennials and Gen Z to take action through our own ways, and I wish we would be known for being the generation that solve these issues some day.Now, back to work and be the hardworking millennial I am.-#97948: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97948","['Like: 22 people', 'Love: 2 people']",0 Comments,1 Share

97946,"Just my two cents on all the girls & NS talk.Firstly, I just want to say that I'm writing this to have an opinion-sharing discussion, just wanna know how others feel about my opinion, can even correct me if you don't agree with me, etc. (no fightings please and please don't try to force your opinions on anyone else).My stand? I'm do not support girls having to do mandatory NS.Reason? Firstly, I personally can totally imagine my monthly-mood-swing self to be pointing a gun at someone demanding they stfu or even myself rolling around in pain or just resorting to spending my whole day on the toilet during my period or when cramps are just so bad. I know that even if a new law comes out that says that girls must serve NS as well, it wouldn't affect me since I'm already past that age and it'll just affect my future child (if I even have one). I'm just saying, I hope people don't underestimate some females and their periods (I know not many have the same symptoms but I personally get really bad cramps sometimes and I just wanna kill everyone who comes within 2m of myself and I'm sure I'm not the only one who has bad cramps).Secondly, I personally feel that females are at a disadvantage when it comes to career progression. I know we talk so big about gender equality but honestly speaking (at least from my very limited experience), I don't see that many female managers (at least not in my last 2 and current workplaces). I mean, we surely can't deny that childbirth is indeed something that females have to consider in their career planning. If we have to take another 2 years of NS into the plan, wouldn't the average age of females during their first child birth increase? Wouldn't that just mean less childbirths? Anyway, these are just my 2 cents. Hoping to hear some more meaningful insights.-#97946: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97946",['Like: 9 people'],19 Comments,3 Shares

So naturally commenters will be hoping for responses from those at uni age or our seniors who have been through similar experiences. Of course, there's nothing inherently wrong with boomers or anyone else expressing advice. In fact, some of them do have useful advice based on their life experiences. The problem, however, is that many of these commenters are downright toxic and dismissive. Please la, different generations have their own struggles. We didn't walk ""10 miles in the snow"" to get to school but it doesn't mean we don't have legitimate troubles. To these people - instead of coming from an angle of condescension by default and trivializing the OP, or pulling out your favourite ""strawberry"" card, try some empathy for a change?

97919,"Sometimes I wish I was a girl. As a 23 year old, if I was a slightly pretty girl, it is extremely easy to make millions. In the past, the one of the easy way for a girl to make millions is to become a prostitute. For example, on the forums, local university girls have an hourly fee of 700 dollars. Some of the younger ones would request to as high as 1000 and if you go to higher end escort forums as much as 5000. Considering an low count of 5 clients a day, that amounts to 5000 a day. Do it 5 days a week and they could make around 100k a month, possibly out earning some of our ministers and definitely out earning the 'mediocre people who earn only 500k a year'. I know of girls auctioning their virginity for multi-millions to Arabian oil barons. These days, there are a lot more options for girls these days. They can be a twitch streamer or a Instagram model. Belle Delphine makes around 2 million a month feeding her octopus pet and selling her bath water for up to $30 a bottle (which was sold out in hours). Only fans is also another platform for girls to make money fast. With technology, they don't even need to meet their clients physically. The possibilities are endless as long as there are legions of horny teenagers (and half grown men) in their mom's basement to exploit. Unfortunately as a male, my options are rather limited. I did consider providing anal services even though I am not gay, but the pay is quite low and the market is rather small in Singapore. Unfortunately, I don't look like Brad Pitt, so no girls would pay me for company. Even if I manage to get to FAANG or hedge funds, I would only make 200k-500k a year by my 30s which is very mediocre compared to what these girls could make at their 20s. Realistically, I would probably work in a regular job, maybe earn my first million by 40 or 30 if I am extremely lucky which is rather sad ngl.-#97919: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97919","['Haha: 85 people', 'Like: 64 people']",94 Comments,37 Shares

If you don’t want to sign one, it’s because you want a split of his or her money. Simple as that. It’s strange how people try to explain it away as that means the other party doesn’t love you, or how it’s insulting. If you love the person even if they had no assets, you’ll sign it. I know a few couples who signed with no hesitation and no drama, because you want to marry the person anyway and don’t care about their assets. It’s not wrong to not want to sign it, but just be upfront and honest and say “I think I deserve a share of your success for supporting you “.

97890,"There are a few lapses that led to Covid 19 being seeded into the community which led to out of control outbreaks and the tightened restrictions today. These lapses are totally commonsensically preventable and it doesn't take a genius to realise what they are.1.Staff wear full PPE, but that PPE is not idiot proof. A fatigued tester may inadvertently  scratch his face with gloves on , or inadvertently touch the outside of his mask  or gown with bare hands... Mistakes do happen. Testers are human, you can't expect them to be 100% on the ball all the time, and it only takes one mistake and you have an epidemic on your hands. Given the thousands of imported cases, such an accident happening is statistically inevitable.2.the staff serving travellers are allowed to mingle and eat with people from the public. This one is self explanatory.3. Travellers serve SHN in places distant from the airport. Who is to say they will not infect the driver (who also comes from the community) or stop somewhere illegally to pee, etc?4.PCR test is not 100% accurate, yet authorities allow people who test negative to shortcut their SHN even though they may be false negative and still have the virus. Contrary to popular belief, a 99% accuracy(sensitivity)  does not mean that if you test 3 times on the same person , then the odds of him testing false negative is 1 in 1 million. It simply means that out of 100 patients rested, one will test false negative.All it takes is one person who slip out of the safety net, and the whole nation is screwed!It is not infeasible to make a safety net that is 99.99% foolproof. Here's what I think should have been done.The authorities should have made changi airport into a self contained facility. Turn changi airport into a self sufficient town with its own amenities, shopping mall  , gyms, parks ,libraries ( I think most already are there).All the staff and their families live on dormitories and converted hotels on site and nobody is allowed to leave. Only goods can go in and out, coz covid 19 is not transmitted by goods.All dedicated facilities for SHN must be located within the confines of the changi airport bubble, so that there is no risk of travellers infecting people on the way to SHN facility in town.Everybody who leaves changi airport must quarantine for 21 days. Travellers should be separated into cohorts according to the day of entry. There will be 21 cohorts, and each cohort will be served by a separate staff, and no intermingling between cohorts and staff serving each cohort is allowed. That way, there is absolutely no possibility for a traveller who has already served 20 days of quarantine, for example, to be infected by a staff member who recently served a traveller with just 1 day of quarantine.Everybody should strictly serve 21 days of quarantine, and there will be no exceptions.

I can’t imagine the coming sem being like this too. It’s really a burden for my family too. To add on why this 9K isn’t justifiable, my prof from SDE didn’t even bother teaching. Instead he just reuse and replay his 2019&2020 recording during our zoom lecture sessions. WTF! I don’t see how the profs can use such minimal effort to conduct online class. Does your prof come into zoom lecture and hit the replay button from his past lecture recording to teach? I understand how we should all be kinder and more accepting but again, this sheer laziness really doesn’t justify how learning should be done. Some students wrote into the school for actions to be done but they have been turned away. Secondly, regarding online examination, I am unsure why some prof doesn’t want to use examsoft aka examplify to conduct examination. This particular prof conducted an online open book examination with zoom proctoring. The instructions he gave were signs of loopholes for possible cheating and dishonesty. For instance when the exam ended at 12, he still allowed student to submit 30 mins later without penalising them. Some students even took the opportunity the resubmit their scripts online which made me ponder if they did cheat. (Tell me if my suspicion could be right?) I mean who knows if students use WhatsApp/ telegram to communicate since we were allow to take pictures for our scripts and send via these communication platform. Earlier last year, some students even got into a heated ‘debate’ with a prof regarding how he want to conduct the examination. People brag about how NUS is still one of the best uni in SG but really is it really that case? Should NUS readjust the school fees and conduct a fairer online exam should there be a need. I really hope the school can do some review. Do also sound out some ridiculous things your profs did and voice out your struggles.  Honestly, NUS need to get their sh*t together!-#97898: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97898","['Like: 8 people', 'Haha: 2 people', 'Care: 1 person']",2 Comments,1 Share
97896,"Anyone here a reptile specialist? I need a way to deal with office snakes. It’s been a year since I’ve joined my new company, and for the longest time I’ve even putting up with a toxic senior at work. I used to brush those feelings aside, and thought I was overthinking; but in recent times I’ve found that my instincts were right since Day 1. Working with this senior was an absolutely traumatising experience, because I felt that I was on the receiving end of workplace bullying.   Many times I’ve worked with her, she would snap at me when I’m explaining my work; she uses a sharp and discouraging tone at me and my ideas; nothing I did was right, nothing I said was right. And being new to the industry, and requiring technical help, I didn’t have the confidence to retaliate or stand up for myself. After a few nasty interactions she would then be nice and friendly with me, sending me confusing signals.In meetings she would try to shush me when I tried to speak up, and too every chance she could to put me down; I even suspected that she spoke ill to my boss behind my back, because my boss seemed to have such a negative impression of me even though I just joined the company. I genuinely think she exploited her position to put me in a bad light. Friends told me she was insecure and threatened, but what she did was absolutely unprofessional. Even when I asked for links for project documents (not confidential btw) to understand our team’s projects, she’ll be like “what information do you need for it? Why do you need it?”, as though she’s trying to keep me out. Today was the last straw, because I opened up her birthday message to me.  It said something along the lines of, how I’ve been having a tough time, and to go wherever I wanted and to do whatever I wanted. I found this absolutely passive aggressive, as though she’s trying to chase me out. It’s very inappropriate to talk to me, about me leaving the firm, when I clearly never brought this matter up. The worst of all, is that everyone else has such a good impression of her, so I’m dealing with this alone. The only thing worse that seeing a ghost, is to be the only person seeing the ghost.

97894,"I just want to ask this because I don't know how other families act.. is it normal if a parent insists a child kisses them on the lips every night? I know on the cheek is normal but my dad insists I kiss him directly on the lips when I go to sleep. If I don't do it properly like I miss and kiss his chin or cheek he will force me to kiss him again. As I grow up I realise it is quite uncomfortable but I don't know if I deserve to feel this way because he is my dad after all. When I was younger he used to insist our kisses involve the tongue but I think after seeing me struggle every time because I clearly don't like it, he just gave up. To be honest, he has made me touch his private part before when I was in lower primary, even though it was one time only I think I feel quite traumatised by it. When I was around 15 and going through puberty he enjoyed touching my legs and pinching my boobs because he thought it was fun. He has stopped doing all this, but I think because of this I don't feel comfortable with the mouth to mouth kiss. I didn't tell my mom about this because as a kid, I thought it was a normal family thing.

Livelihoods are on the line, people are dying, and Singaporeans are voluntarily making sacrifices by staying at home, and yet what is severely lacking from the recent posts are gratitude and perspective of the wider pandemic situation. The only way for us to pandemic is to be united as one. Not only does complaining about your predicament not solve the problem, it simply aggravates emotions in readers. The comments section of NUSWhispers posts relating to Covid measures, commencement complaints and the earlier NUS zoning policy have become more emotional, with many flaming the OP.

97856,"NUS commencement ceremonyYesterday (20 May 2021), NUS has announced to hold the commencement ceremonies online instead of in-person for the class of 2020 and 2021. This is due to the rising number of covid-19 infection in Singapore since April this year. I agree with NUS that considering the tightened government measures and the health and safety of ourselves, family and friends who will be attending the ceremonies, it is in our best interests to not hold the in-person ceremonies as originally scheduled in June and July. However, I am disappointed in the way that NUS handled this. I listed down 3 reasons below:1. There were ample opportunities for NUS to hold the ceremonies for the class of 2020 in February and March 2021. During this period, there were few covid cases in Singapore, and the government has gradually permitted a larger group of social gathering. Two universities in Singapore, the SIT and SIM, had taken advantage of this opportunity and held in-person graduation ceremonies in this period. Knowing that the covid situation is fluid and can change quickly, NUS should quickly grab hold of the opportunity in February and March to hold the graduation ceremonies for the class of 2020. 2. For the class of 2021 whose graduation ceremonies were supposed to take place this year, NUS changed the graduation ceremonies to online instead of postponing it to a later date to see if the situation improves. This is unlike what NUS did for the class of 2020, where the graduation ceremonies were postponed for a year, and an attempt was made to hold it in January 2021 (which ultimately did not happen because of tight government measures) before the decision was made to change to the online ceremony.  I find it hard to understand why did NUS make the swift decision to hold online ceremonies for the class of 2021 where currently, the covid-19 vaccine is being rolled out and the covid situation could improve in a year, making in-person ceremonies possible. 3. Based on the swift decision that NUS made to hold online ceremonies for the class of 2021 and the responses from the NUS students that I gathered from social media, it is clear that NUS did not seek the opinion of the students, the people who the graduation is meant for, before deciding to hold online ceremonies.  Despite these disappointing observations, I am heartened to know that NUS students have already taken to an online platform, change.org, to get signatures to call for NUS to re-look at its decision. This shows that although NUS did not take the initiative to speak with students, the students are not willing to stay silent. They will speak up and continue to do so until NUS is willing to listen. This is not the first time that NUS students have turned to the online platform to raise issues that NUS overlooked. If you search on change.org alone, you will see several more examples. These are good signs since universities are places where students go to learn to think critically, not follow blindly.  All in all, I am disappointed in the way NUS handled the graduation ceremonies for the class of 2020 and 2021. NUS could have better manage this and many other past issues if they have communicated with students, and include student's opinions in their decision-making process. Moving forward, NUS should think of ways to communicate with students more often, such as holding meetings between students representatives and the management team every semester.-#97856: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97856","['Like: 14 people', 'Haha: 1 person']",2 Comments,4 Shares

97851,"I wonder how many people will attend the virtual commencement. For Class of 2020, it’s been almost a year since we received the certificate. Most of us have started working or proceeded with further studies. The ceremony is more of seeing your classmates again, going back to NUS one more time and reminiscing the undergraduate life. Of course, there could be other reasons, like for our families. I think we can safely say that the ceremony is more for the memories.We have waited this long, only to know NUS decides they opt for a virtual ceremony instead. I understand that the school has tried, and we appreciated that. Remember the thankful comments last year when they announced to hold a physical ceremony at a later date? But NUS has obviously given up trying at this point, which is why this is disappointing. I am not saying do the ceremony now. Instead, have it another time, when it’s safer.“What if it takes 3/4/5/6/7/8/9 years for things to be safer? The staff will suffer from organising the commencement. The hall isn’t big enough for this” Worst case scenario, it took us a few years to recover from COVID. There would be quite a lot of graduates but similarly we were having the ceremony in batches anyway. The number of virtual attendees could be way lesser. Easier to plan, but why are we taking the easy way out here? I foresee the virtual commencement can happen in 2 ways via zoom or whatever online platform:1. Default setting where you see the participants in boxes. People can choose to on their camera or not. Then the various speeches, followed by a roll call. Meanwhile, we just sit in front of the screen and listen. Why would people take time off their schedule for this experience? Puzzles me.2. Webinar style. Well this is probably worst. If there could be other ways a virtual commencement could be fun and celebratory, please share. I understand that not everyone wants to attend a commencement (virtual or physical). It is fine, but there are people that want to attend it. Having a virtual one removes the actual experience some of us were looking for.

97843,"Holding our commencement ceremony online feels like a spit in our faces. Many of us has had a mentally tough 4 years, particularly in 2020. We do not seem to be getting any support from the school. They ask us to unite with the rest of Singapore, but NUS does not seem to be united with us. We are the batch who are the most affected by Covid-19. Our exchange were cancelled/recalled, our lessons were replaced with recordings (even lecturers uploading past semesters lecture recordings), we were restricted from even going to school. We were paying the same school fees nonetheless. Don’t we deserve at least a bit more from a university “consistently ranked amongst the world’s best”?Maybe this feels like an entitled opinion. But to have a virtual commencement feels like tokenism. It feels like NUS is taking the easy way out so as to no have to deal with administrative inconveniences of planning and holding a physical ceremony. We are students/alumnus, not customers. We are not buying the degree and formality. If we were really to have an online commencement, maybe it would be better off if NUS would just upload 2019’s commencement video onto Luminus for us to download like we do for lectures. We are used to it anyway. Those who want to can even watch it at 2x speed. Yes, we are in a global health crisis and there are many more pressing issues. We do not need the ceremonies to be held right now. The batch of 2020 have already waited excitedly for one year. I believe many of us are willing to wait longer, even if it is held in batches. A virtual commencement loses its significance even if traditional proceedings are retained. To the management team, perhaps you do not have children, perhaps none of your children have graduated, perhaps all have graduated. But for our parents, to miss out on seeing their child graduating in person, being relegated to watching a computer screen after investing so much does not seem fair. They have waited 23-26 years for this day. I’m sure even you  all had fond memories from your time in university and at your commencement ceremony when standing next to your loved ones wearing the gown. I am not asking it on behalf of us students, but for our parents for all their sacrifice. They deserve better.I really hope that NUS will reconsider this decision, and to not have the commencement online. Please do not deny us this proud once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Conducted Commencement for 2020 batch during Phase 3 as soon as they got the chance to, because Covid is an evolving situation3. Postponed Commencement for 2021 batch to later date because of the rise in cases and the importance of physical Commencement for both the students and the families4. Did not restrict students' access to the University facilities and Campus during Phase 2 so as not to cause too much inconvenience to students wanting to come to Campus and use facilities5. Did not result in Covid cluster although there were few students who were tested positiveNUS:1. No SU during 2021 Sem 1 because you have already gotten use to the past half-Semester of Zoom teachings2. Postponed Commencement for 2020 batch to coincide with 2021 Commencement, planned for 6 months after Phase 3 even though they have plenty of opportunity to conduct3. Cancelled both physical Commencement for 2020 and 2021 batches and transit to virtual instead, because it is not fair to postpone for 2021 batch but not 2020 batch, but hey let's just get these 2 batches over and done with even though there is a decent chance for 2021 Commencement to be conducted at a later date4. No students were allowed to come to school when they had no lessons during Phase 2. No students shall use the Campus's facilities and study in school if you do not have any lesson on that day. Hey let's slapped another Zoning restriction to prevent students from walking around in Campus. You want to go to UTown but were from Biz? Nah bro ain't letting you do so.5. Forces students to download a poorly-named App and to show a colored Pass whenever they want to buy food on Campus or take the shuttle bus. Never mind that our wifi sucks and some students could not connect to it at times. While we are at it, why not install a bunch of big TV screens in canteens to display ads, so that students cannot see the stall menu.6. Still results in cases of staff contracting Covid, but hey at least we have no cluster right because we were so smart in our restrictions.Obviously NUS has done nothing wrong and one can't fault NUS for these policies because the rationale is not wrong. Follow SOP and do things safely. However in doing so they have caused tons of frustrations and inconvenience to students and staff, while unilaterally implementing restrictive policies. One can't help but wonder that NTU's actions show more signs of taking students' welfare, convenience and university life into account compared to NUS, where it is not convincing to believe that NUS makes actions by taking into consideration the students first. Rather, it appears that all of NUS policies are designed to protect its image.- Just a disappointed NUS student who felt that NUS could have done better and not cause so much frustration and inconvenience to its students and staff in the name of protecting them-#97834: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97834","['Like: 67 people', 'Haha: 6 people']",0 Comments,8 Shares
97832,"#97788: Thanks everyone for replying on your opinions about the prenuptial agreement. More background on what's happening - both me and my fiancé are local but my fiancé's mom is a westerner so a prenup is very important to her, which, oddly speaking she and her husband dont even have one and yet, she's asking her son to do one with me. So to further explain, I make 4k/month and my fiancé makes 12k/month. His mom thinks so highly of him and thinks he has a lot of money. I mean, if I was a mom who has a son doing so well in life I'd too also but his mom doesn't know the struggles his son is going through. We both have student loans, bills and family to support.. I never have any issues with him supporting his family, his brother especially since he is still in university and as a big brother, he wants to give his brother a good life and not go through hardship like we both did - working part time and studying while trying to get our degrees. We've been struggling to save for our wedding too, cutting down on our expenses etc. Actually in fact, his mom doesn't know a lot about our hardship the last 8 years. To her, her son is some sort of a star that she's always so proudly boasting on Facebook to her friends. Prenup is honestly just the tip of the iceberg on why I'm re-evaluating my decision if I want to continue the wedding. Despite being together for the last 8 years since I was 18, we only got engaged just last year in 2020 after I asked him if he had ever thought of marrying me? This is also mainly because my mom nagged at me for being in a relationship for too long haven't settle down yet. It also took him quite some time to tell his mom he proposed to me, which was a kind of pathetic the way he propose but I've learned to let go cause I don't want to be petty and hold grudge on how other people gets nice proposal but not me. His reason for not telling his mom because he dont want her to feel weirded out that we haven't live together but already considering settling down. There is a lot more actually but it'll be too long to list out what I'm feeling. So him mentioning prenups was honestly the last straw for me. I dont know if this is normal for couples to have so many arguments before the wedding or am I just unlucky? Sorry if it sound like I'm a brat but i'm just upset and wanted to voice out how I feel about my relationship and if I should continue this wedding or break it off before its too late. -#97832: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97832","['Like: 25 people', 'Sad: 12 people', 'Care: 11 people']",27 Comments,3 Shares
97829,"where can we submit feedback for the NUS internship system? is NUSWhispers the only channel of feedback for this? I feel like NUS is the only educational institution that actively gets in our way of doing a good internship. I have already completed my internship requirement, but I want to give some feedback so that juniors don't have to suffer through the useless requirements of NUS internship system. I did an additional internship without all the bureaucracy of NUS internship system, and I actually could focus on doing a good internshipBefore the internship starts, you have to waste time getting HR to re-post the job posting on talent connect, then u make a re-application, then the HR makes a re-offer, then u make a re-accept. during the internship, you have to write a 20 page report about the company. on top of that, you need to get your manager to write a report as well to satisfy the staff in charge of NUS internships. I understand that the staff in charge of NUS internships need to show that they are doing something, but this cannot come at the cost of students trying to do a good internship. the system is a huge waste of time, takes away focus from doing a good internship, has zero value add for the students. this needs to changebtw, PSA for juniors: talent connect is filled to the brim with these invalid reposts, use linkedin/glassdoor/indeed/company website instead of talent connect. in my first year of applying for internships, I thought the talent connect postings were legit, and it caused me to waste a huge amount of time on these useless applications. almost none of the applications on talent connect resulted in an interview. whereas, there was a high rate of interviews for the mainstream job sites. if u submitted applications via talent connect and didn't hear back, just wanted to let u know that it is not because u are bad, it is because talent connect is bad (to put it mildly)-#97829: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97829",['Like: 16 people'],1 Comment,2 Shares

97823,"Hi all, I am from the class of 2020 and have just received the news regarding the virtual commencement. Suffice to say, I am extremely disappointed at how the situation turned out. I can't say the same for others but commencement to me was important for one main reason - it was a day dedicated to my parents. Raised from poor households, both of my parents couldn't afford to study, they were thrown into the low-skilled workforce at in their teens and have never looked back since. It would come as no surprise that they were often green with envy when looking at graduation photos of other families. It was then when I decided I needed to make their dreams come true, that this would (quite possibly) be one of the proudest moments they will be of me, when they would see me on stage, graduating with a degree they couldn't have attained themselves. To people who are gonna comment the following - here are my responses:""It's just a ceremony, they are already proud of you"": But the ceremony is monumental, it would really mean something to them ""You've already graduated, who even cares about it anymore"": I just feel that it's such a pity for my parents, I just feel that it's a missed once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make them happy""You could just take photos with your parents somewhere else"": That's exactly what we would do, but I feel that a huge part of the commencement experience would be lost if it's virtual.""Stop whining"": This post is all that I will rant about this matterIn conclusion, I just feel that making it virtual would mean that the commencement has lost a significant portion of meaning (for me at least), and that it would just be an easy way out for NUS. I may be selfish in preferring to wait another year to getting it done and over with through zoom, but I would like to be selfish just this once. I dream of the day when my parents could witness first-hand me receiving my graduation scroll in my gown on stage.-#97823: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97823","['Like: 38 people', 'Care: 18 people']",0 Comments,4 Shares

It’s the time where our parents get a chance to witness a once in a lifetime opportunity to see their child on stage receiving their degree from a prestigious university like NUS. I’m very sure he/she is not the only one feeling as such. It sucks that the school was not quick enough to hold a ceremony at the start of the year when things were stable just like how NTU did. It definitely sucks that instead of waiting it out till the end of the year, they were rash to change it to a virtual event. There is no harm in waiting it out right now.

97814,"Dear Student Union (NUSSU), I think it is evident from the sentiments of the graduates and soon-to-be graduates that the decision from the school administration was indeed a demoralising one. The prestige and traditions of such ceremonies have to be upheld - even if it needs to be further scaled-down (at later dates) or even postponement again during the December period. The decision has to be made with each cohort in mind, i.e. the Class of 2021 can still afford to see one cycle of postponement much like the decision from NTU. This is a lack of justifiable rationale for the present arrangement and a virtual commencement does not reflect the same prestige of in-person commencement. It does not absolutely make any sense to reinvent virtual ceremonies when the sentiments on the ground are disjointed, disappointment and frustration. There needs to be appropriate justice for the rigour one has taken in a one-in-a-lifetime milestone and after the financial sacrifices for many families alike. Commencement is not an event. Traditions need to be upheld.

97801,"Dear admin, please disregard the previous post, as I've made some correction in my confession. Please post this version instead, thank you.Dear C, if you see this, I hope you'll learn from your mistakes, but I'm sorry that I can't be with you. Not because I have lost feelings for you, but because I can no longer see you the same anymore. After several weeks of meeting each other, I gave you my exclusivity by terminating my chats with other guys whom I met online. Despite how nice they were to me, I told myself to be fair to you as well, because I met you first, and your awesome treatment towards me deserved some respect from me. I asked you if you were still chatting with other dates or planning to meet them, but you said no, and continued dating me until the day we officially became a couple. After 3 weeks, you began acting cold towards me. You tend to take longer to reply to my messages, sometimes you even forgot to wish me goodnight and just headed to bed, and I could only accept the fact that you were tired and went to bed without overthinking too much. You went to meet your friends without asking me, though you knew I'd always say yes because I treat this as basic courtesy and respect between us, but now you just dropped me a text telling me that you're meeting your friends. You started using exam and CCA as excuses to stop meeting up with me for lunch, dinner, and even hanging out together, though I knew how little time you actually needed for that semester. Fast forward to a week later, you came clean to me by telling me that you shouldn't have been together with me, because some girls on dating app whom MIA you actually replied to your texts and initiated to meet up, and you guys were still in touch with each other. You said you just continued to text each other without meeting them in person and felt that they might be more suitable for you. I take this as emotional cheating, but whether or not you guys have met, though you said you haven't, this is no longer something that could hurt me more than your breakup with me.Several months later you texted me again, telling me that you still love me, just because you went out for dates with them and realized that they are not your type. I'm sorry, I'm not a replacement, I'm not an option for you to choose when you had no choice, I'm not somebody who can accept you whenever you are available for such ""good"" reason. You went out with them, you had fun with them, you texted them happily everyday, and lied to me about you only texting me exclusively. I thought that was a fair game where if I stopped texting and meeting other guys because I have decided to stay focused solely on you, then you should do the same for me too. Even if you didn't, you should have at least told me, and right now I just feel stupid for giving you such privilege. I could have continued meeting other guys, some of them are doing well in their career, some are better looking than you, but I chose you.C, to be very honest with you, I could see myself giving you a second chance if you were to apologize to me earlier when I was still contemplating to salvage this relationship, but not now when I'm enjoying being single without being hurt anymore. Please stop telling me how sorry you feel about this whole situation. There is no way I could see us getting together anymore. I hope you will learn from your mistake and avoid doing this to another decent girl that you'll meet next time.-#97801: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97801",['Like: 44 people'],11 Comments,8 Shares

He has no time for you now, much less for kids and you in future. Don’t hope. Open your eyes.  Similarly, mine is loyal. Stable job. But that’s all. We quarrel everyday. He scolds the kids everyday because they are too slow. He wants them to complete everything fast so that he can return to his phone. Eat, toilet, tv all need to use phone. He doesn’t care about spending time with me nor settling issues on house or kids. He does not cook, wash, help, plan.. and is contented to just be with his phone everyday. Birthday? Who cares! Confinement? Who cares! Kids need to pack bags? Who cares! Kids hungry? Who cares! Thinking of celebrating something? Who cares! Secretly.. what is worst for me.. is that I have explicitly stated that a certain part of my body is off limits during sex. I also made it overtly known I am uncomfortable with it. He still chooses to do what he likes. I don’t even know if this is assault. But who cares!We also did talk through, quarrel, plead, etc. Each time he will just apologise but you know, a leopard never changes its spots. I have tried to write down, remind, thank him each time he does something for us, in the hope he will realise it’s what works, but nothing can make it. All you want, and I want, is their effort. But no....Please leave while you can. You will never be happy with a guy who doesn’t know how to look at you. To look after you. To look out for you.

We went out on a date twice, but after that he ghost me. My friends advise me to move on and find another guy, and I tried to do that by making new friends with guys. A few guys asked me to be his girlfriend. However, I find myself rejecting all of their advances because I cannot forget my crush James, and I want to remain single and available for James if he ask me to be his girlfriend one day. Around two month back, my younger sister (who is my only sibling) brought home her boyfriend and to my surprise he is my crush! I don't understand why does my crush choose my sister over me as they have a big age gap (5 years) whereas we only have a age gap of 2 years. Since then, my crush will come over to our house for meal with our family regularly, and every time it is a painful experience for me, and I have to put on a 'happy face' in front of my family and my crush. To make matter worse, my sister also has sex with my crush in our bedroom (I share the same bedroom with my sister). At first, my sister only does the deed when me and my parents were out for work. However, after I caught them in the heat a few times when I returned home early from work, they became more daring and would do it even though I am at home. My parents are both essential workers with strict working hours so they can easily avoid my parents. I have tried to avoid meeting my crush in my house (and hearing them in their bedroom routine) as much as possible by going to my office. But from this week we are required to work from home. I dread seeing my crush but I cannot avoid him. I guess I am jealous over my sisters who can get the guy I want and also fulfill her sexual needs, while I am alone and lonely and sexually frustrated. To be honest, there were a few times where I thought about sabotaging my sister and my crush by telling my parents about what they did in our bedroom.

This thought scares me because I never know that I have the capacity to have such evil thoughts. In the end, I did not act on these ideas because I do not want to hurt my sister.

97769,"People who are calling for another round of total CB lockdown is just plain ignorant and selfish. You can only see yourself enjoying the perks of WFH of getting paid while getting more personal time, less crowds for you to do your daily activities and commuting, or you’re just an introvert. What you don’t see are the hawkers in ulu areas closing their stalls after the entire day of selling only a few miserable bowls of noodles, barely making the rental let alone commissions for Grab or Foodpanda. What you don’t see are taxi uncles driving around the city from one end to the other frantically searching for customers and ending up trying to fight against one another for customers. What you don’t see are the retrenched retail staffs who are applying for 50 jobs a day while scrimp and save on their retrenchment package. It is unfortunate that we ended up in P2HA, but instead of asking how to implement draconian measures immediately, why don’t you look at how to plug the hole? Strict assessment on entry for every traveler regardless of residential status, why did the people leave in the first place knowing the pandemic is not under control? Other than compassionate reasons with proof, there is no other acceptable reason. And what’s with the constant strawman fallacy argument? No one is asking to close all the borders, only to those high-risk countries. You mean we rather suffer the economic losses from implementing lockdown than subsidizing cost of foreign workers from other lower risk countries? Why? Because some infamous words from random has-been or angmoh spectator trying to score internet points said so?Not poor enough to beg on the street and end up homeless but not earning enough having to scrimp and save to put food on the table for the family.

For my course, I have the 2 options:- Complete 8 core module then do my dissertation- Complete 8 core modules and 2 electives (no dissertation)Pros of doing a dissertation:- Freedom to research area. I get to choose an area that I am interested in. Cons of doing a dissertation:- Pretty useless since I am not doing any research nor do I plan to do a PhD. I am intending to help out in my family business once I finish my Masters- Might take a longer time than usual to graduate.

I find that he is already biased against me from the assumptions he would find opportunities to put me down.To provide some context, appraisal is coming up in my organisation. My appraiser rose through the ranks as career progression gives higher weight to staff who stays longer in the company.  Recently he made an untimely and unjustified feedback by making unfair statements (close to Appraisal) that I have not been tracking my work at all. I had to rope in my colleague to clarify that it's not the case. How ridiculous. For email write ups, he would write a LONG paragraph to highlight a one liner mistake, and use that as a justification to re-write everything. And yep, he will prob use that an excuse to give me a lower grade. I am wondering if he's insecure because of his 0% exposure private sector experience. He's also new to project managing and first time leading a small team.Last but not least, I found out that he was subtlety spreading gossip when he realised me and another colleague got along v well. I found out when that seniors' clique kept asking if that colleague of mine broke up and kept asking me if I was gg to be attached.

Stuck in a loveless marriage with someone who only cares about himselfI’m female in early 30s and currently a year into a relationship with a selfish man. Won’t bore you with too much details, but basically he doesn’t bother to learn my love language, never remembers the little things, and probably spends more time looking at his phone/computer screen than looking at me. After the initial 1-2 months of honeymoon period, it feels like I’ve been giving and giving in this relationship without receiving anything in return and it’s starting to tire me out. Talked it out with him few times before, he just kept saying sorry every time, but until now nothing has changed.My parents are pressuring me to marry due to my age, yet somehow I already know I won’t be happy if I marry him? But at the same time, I’m scared of being alone when I’m old and frail. I have some colleagues who are middle-aged single women, they are perpetually irritable and grumpy and it really scares me to think that I may end up like them. Also, it’s always been my dream to be a mum, I’m not young anymore and don’t have that many years left to give birth. I’m in a dilemma as to whether I should just settle for this man (at least he is loyal and has good career), to give my parents peace of mind and fulfil my dream of becoming a mum, or face the prospect of being single for the rest of my life, given how hard it is to find someone new at my age.

97744,"hello, 22F just graduated from NUS this sem. (first post pls b kind...) I actually stayed in hall the past 4 years with the exception of (Y3S1 and Y4S1). my last semester in hall was truly one of the worst ones yet. I spent over half the semester crying and only one hall friend who knew had so many commitments that I ended up telling him that I'd stop confiding in him only because he was so bad at replying and constantly flaked on our meetings. I did tell him that if he was free I would be more than happy to talk to him though.. anyways, I guess it must be a lil unexpected that someone who stayed in hall all 4 years of her uni life would feel so shit in the last semester but the main reason why it was so bad imo was because of the friendship problems I had to deal with. to give some context, there's this group of friends that I expected to hang out with since we will be in the same block. I've known them for the past few years but the problem is that they (along with some others) were already an established clique from the previous sem due to zoning and I was really quite worried before moving back as I didn't really know how I would fit in especially because I was on awkward terms with one of the ""some others"" in the clique. moving on the the actual situation of it all: I was actually quite optimistic at the start even though I'm not really the kind to approach others, I did warm up to the group in the first few weeks. something I noticed however was how they would gather in each others' rooms even tho I was in, they never really invited me to hang w them (note: safe distancing was practiced throughout the sem). I did ask my faculty friends about it and they told me that there's no harm just popping by or taking the initiative to ask what time they will be having dinner but honestly, its much easier for them as a group to invite me too because I was often afraid of intruding their time since they didn't invite me even though its so convenient for them to do so. everything was going fine until one night when I asked some of them individually if they will be having dinner that night and they all told me separately that they were either going out for dinner or already had plans. a while later that night I found out that the clique went out for dinner without inviting me but what hurt me the most was how none of them bothered to tell me that I had to make my own dinner plans since we would usually eat together. after that incident, I emotionally withdrew myself a lot and when I talked to one of them about my concerns and how I felt so far, I felt even more alone because it seemed as if everyone only cared about how uncomfortable the other guy seemed around me when he does join the group and no one ever bothered to empathise with how I felt hiding my feelings and pretending that I was okay whenever he was around so that the rest won't feel awkward. At one point of the convo, it felt as if I was the only problem there, causing all the ""weirdness"" and I just felt so bad about myself. I didn't say anything about how I felt from the conversation because I was afraid that it might come off as them not even trying at all. but I really was grateful for the company tho it didn't change how I felt about the smaller day to day things that made me feel left out. after the conversation, I just treated as if everything was sorted out and tried not to dwell on the smaller things. we did hang out more afterwards and had fun times together but there were times too when they talk about their group chat or when I look over and see their matching wallpapers and ultimately feel like I'll never be a part of them. sometimes it felt like everyone already had common knowledge but I'll presume that its because I wasn't in the group chat that I don't really know what's going on.. I know it's stupid to nitpick on these small things but it really does add up especially when everyone is living together.I thought to myself so many times about just ditching everything and move back home earlier or just go home for 1-2 weeks without telling anyone. I think the only reason why I didn't do that was because it was my last semester in hall and I wanted to cherish my stay. I did end up spending more time with my faculty friends tho and I'm happy to have them through all these, especially one whom I ranted to from the start of the semester. now that the sem has ended and I've moved out of hall, I feel more relieved that everything is no longer in-my-face. even though I wasn't added into their group til the end and I still feel sad when I happen see their group photo from that night on social media, it was nice of them to have told me that they hope to be able to hang out in the future. despite saying all of these, I still genuinely think that they are nice people. perhaps they just don't have the capacity to empathise with me or be more tactful in certain situations. there are many other details and incidents that I didn't include (cos rly >4 months worth???) but thanks for reading if you've made it this far!-#97744: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97744","['Care: 7 people', 'Like: 5 people', 'Haha: 2 people']",10 Comments,2 Shares

97736,"What is your opinion on trading stocks as a full-time career? I have graduated with a PhD from NUS. However, I am not interested in pursuing a career in academia. Additionally, during my PhD, I gradually lost all interest in the field that I was in (I was in BioMed engineering). I told myself, I am never going to do a job that is related to my PhD or biomedical, and started to think about changing career. During my PhD, I found out that one thing that interests me is trading stocks. Hence, after I graduated with my PhD from NUS, I started exploring trading as a career, using a part of my saving as the capital to trade. Although I have a few years of experiences with investing in stocks, when it comes to trading for an income, the difficulty level was much much higher. During the first year or so, my income was negative and I kept on losing money. It was a painful process. Especially when I see my friends who did not do PhD and have a regular office job drawing a fixed amount of money, sometimes 4 figures, every month. But I learnt from my lessons and understand what causes me to lose money. Now, I have consistent profit and have covered back the initial losses. I know of a few people who earn 6 figures a month from trading and I am confident I will join them one day. From my experience in trading, it is a job where you can earn much higher than many other regular jobs if you can overcome the initial stage of losing money (and are left with sufficient capital to trade). Additionally, the working hours are flexible and short (some traders only trade 15 minutes a day). The list of benefits goes on. Despite these benefits, however, I find that there are not many full-time traders. I am curious as to why is this so. I hypothesise that many people see trading in a negative light. Is this true?

97733,"As someone who has degrees in CS and Engineering, let me compare the 2 for those deciding which degree to pursue:Why CS > Engineering: - Better prep (training, internships, networking) for software jobs, which are typically much better paid and more comfortable than traditional engineering jobs. This disparity is only going to widen. - More prestigious (recently anyway). Also, you get to surround yourself with smarter people, which, over 4 years, makes a difference in your development. - Easier and more interesting curriculum (Sit in a chem eng year 4 lecture and you'll know what I mean) - More fun. I know this one is subjective but many CS students actually code for pleasure, often applying techniques they picked up in class. How many chem engineers calculate turbulent flow in their free time? - More career flexibility/ options: can build a startup/ freelance as a dev quite easily, or move to Thailand to be a digital nomad, if you're into that kind of thing. Try freelancing as a mech engineer. - Better use of time: being IT-literate will help you tremendously in your personal life anyway, why not pursue it academically/ professionally? Maybe being a civil engineer will come in handy when doing your home reno or something. - CS gives you a worldview and tools for thinking that can generalize well across domains (divide and conquer, abstraction, algorithmic thinking, complexity, learning from data), whereas traditional engineering tends to teach you narrower, domain-specific frameworks.Why Engineering > CS:None, honestly. Can't think of any disadvantages of CS that don't also apply to other technically rigorous courses such as Engineering and Math, esp in the SG context.-#97733: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97733","['Like: 14 people', 'Haha: 6 people']",6 Comments,2 Shares
97732,"My two cents on the new covid measures.Prior to the restrictions, restaurants and gyms were the few exceptions where individuals could remove their mask in a public space. Hence, the restriction on dining-in and the use of gyms are meant to curtail any opportunity for people to congregate in mask-less settings. However, it seems that a glaring omission remains - smokers. They are allowed (or encouraged) to congregate at smoking points to smoke, mask-off. The limited size of smoking points generally mean that social distancing of mask-less smokers is limited, because smoking outside of the demarcated area may result in fines. Why are smokers allowed this exception to the rule, to go mask-less in public? Unless clear scientific evidence is available to show that the consumption of cigarettes reduces the risk of covid transmission, this glaring omission should be circumscribed immediately. It hardly bodes well for smokers to be given such a liberty, when the majority of individuals who are non-smokers have willingly sacrificed their own liberty for social interactions in the name of protecting those around us from the risk of covid transmission. Hence, smokers should not be allowed to light up in public while covid measures are in place. Smokers should be reminded that on the bright side, such a measure will help to correspondingly reduce the strain on health infrastructure in the future for diseases such as lung or throat cancer.-#97732: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97732","['Like: 19 people', 'Haha: 3 people']",0 Comments,1 Comment
97730,"TL;DR, people should not behave with that holier than thou attitude over people who refuses to wear mask in public. Shouldn't dox others by digging out their past too.Since the start of this pandemic and the initiation of the requirement for everyone to wear a mask in public, there were some individuals who were caught markless in public. Some of these individuals even got aggressive towards the authorities and were rather stubborn over their beliefs regarding the donning of face mask in public.And of course, the reason why we were made known of such incidents were often due to someone else in public filming these people being caught in the act. Thereafter, these videos will be put up in a myriad of social media sites and may even be made into a meme for everyone to ridicule over.Yes, I do agree that such errant behaviour should not be condoned and the authorities should indeed take them to task. However, don't we find that the act of sensationalising these videos to be rather a rather low down behaviour too? Worse when there is some form of doxxing involved from digging up the past of these individuals and to make them a talking point over their behaviour.Just like the recent case of that lady who was caught maskless by the Safe Distancing Ambassadors and in turned questioned the authorities. Is it necessary to dig her past and go around plastering her days in the Navy? What's worse is when some commenters of these post went about equating her days in the Navy with her unruly behaviour. Our veterans are human being too and they are also entitled to their own opinions and beliefs. If it so happened that their behaviour is against the law, we should just let the authorities handle them. The act of judging an individual based on their past will achieve nothing but make you not much better as a person too.To think about it, these people who went about doxxing others are not much of a saint either. To these people, are you confident to tell the world that you are indeed following the rules strictly and is straight as an arrow? I don't think so. Nobody is perfect.I had often seen lots of people wearing their mask like chin straps or to wear one and to not cover their nose in public either. So I don't think anybody should go about sensationalising such cases of individuals who breached the mask wearing rule.-#97730: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97730","['Like: 10 people', 'Haha: 2 people']",3 Comments,1 Share
97728,"The view from a hospital pharmacy counterMy recent encounter with Mr LSF whose transplanted kidney, has started to fail again after 20 years, left me thinking. Of the sense of loss. Not long ago, perhaps five, six years back, this jolly sixty- plus- year- old man, became a regular at our pharmacy. For reasons unclear, he tended to linger at my counter, chit-chatting me up. To be frank, having to give out medications to so many people a day, I usually remember the medications they have more than the people they are. But this man lingered on so long, for so numerous the occasions, sharing his kidney transplant story, how proud he was to maintain his fitness regime, recommending me the brands of toothpaste on the pharmacy floor, I was not sure whether to feel flattered because it was me, he targeted those conversations on, or irritable (common sir, these are too long-winded to be exchanges between strangers on the train, or on the hospital pharmacy counter, for that matter. And there are the next patients behind, always …)His manners were impeccable, his good intention often shone through, so there were no reasons to be rude. I, though feeling slightly unease, politely listened through his lengthy convos on mundane matters like his love for crab cuisine, his recent cruise to somewhere etc, while trying to think of ways to direct his attention to the fuming red patients standing behind him. (They looked as if I were committing an indecency by lending an ear to him. They were longing for me to stop)Fast forward to today, I saw his script, his name on it, but instead of him, his wife and son came forward  collecting his medications. His condition must have taken a turn for a worse, to have BOTH the son and the wife accompanying this visit. True enough, the notes said his transplanted kidney was failing, he was back to peritoneal dialysis and was going to be admitted for a myriad of infections. It brought me back to that amorphous feeling, an uncategorized sense of loss, of the grief that is to come. Not a personal loss as he and I were not related, but dismal enough to put me in a melancholic mood for the day because he was a familiar face.How many more years, months he has, I wonder?After the death of another patient, a year ago, I had for some time experience a most vivid feeling of loss, a spot of bother that lasted surprisingly longer that I had expected. Mrs C was a perennial fixture in the pharmacy, for she came by every 2 months, an amputee in wheelchairs, to collect her bags and bags of medications and dressings, and morphine tablets and bottles of morphine syrups - the highlight of her every visit.She belonged to the categories of anxious people, who existed before immaterial time, had somehow got hold of my supervisor’s number and requested for her medicine to be prepared before arrival. This process was neither right nor was it our standard procedure, but her suffering must have felt so immense, and her irritation so palpable, we all scuttled to do her biddings every time she came. Definitely not out of fear, perhaps out of pity, I think? More certainly, it was perhaps because she was a regular - one that we thought belonged to the vampire caste, feasted on the opioid craze and would last forever till eternity.   After some time, I didn’t know why but she preferred me (apart from my soft-hearted boss, that one was definitely her favourite) to dispense medications to her. She usually asked me how I was, if have I eaten etc, questions that I classified under diatribes that didn’t merit a counter enquiry and proper response. I, again, usually just listened and nodded, out of politeness (and at any rate, I was exhausted with the crowd, making small talks was never my forte).The last time we talked she commented on how exhausted I looked. I chuckled as usual, and went on to explain about the change in the morphine syrup formulation we were giving her that day. Two weeks later, I heard news of her passing… A life extinguished.For me, it must be a very terrible thing, to see so much and to feel so deeply.Amid all the merry-making, pleasure-seeking, asset-accumulating life processes, when you are engrossed, so engrossed that you have no sense of proportion, no sense of awareness - of your cosmic unimportance, a life unfolding before your eyes suddenly interrupted, a door slammed in your face, a bold reminder “So this is what life’s really like. Deceive yourself no longer. Get your priority right.""#hospitalpharmacy #pharmacist-#97728: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97728","['Like: 87 people', 'Care: 29 people', 'Sad: 15 people']",9 Comments,13 Shares

In that sense, I am doing well for myself. However, some of my family members are not doing well and I feel very guilty. I feel like it is not right for me to be doing so well while my family is getting worse. Part of me is blaming myself for sacrificing my family wellbeing with my desire to succeed as if I can do so well, I can previously spend my time helping them instead of just focusing on myself. Because of this, I can't get over this constant worry and guilt for them while I try to find ways to help them before I can leave SG in peace. However, because of some of their circumstances, I can't fully help them and I keep questioning myself whether is it I can't help them or I don't really want to help them as I only care about myself. Furthermore, if I leave SG, my family may be worse as I am always there to help the 'more vulnerable' family members. This makes me feel more bad about myself as I keep thinking how my family members are getting worse while I leave SG for my own success. The constant guilt-trip has been affecting my mood and my ability to focus, impeding my ability to study/work. People who find success in managing themselves and their close ones, how do you do it?

Im not sure if he did go and find when we were together for that 1-2 months. I feel so dirty because i dont know how many women he touch before he touched me and now touching other women again. I feel so angry and disappointed that he dont know how to love and cherish his own body and let those prostitutes play with his body and he playing with theirs. No wonder he always told me that he don't have much money, now i know the reason is because he spent it on prostitutes. I gave my true feelings onto him when we were together yet he treats me like a fool. Im suffering here yet he is enjoying happily outside. I dont know he is such a person and a jerk.

So when I tell others that I do not need their help, I really do not need their help and don't expect it, and vice versa, if I do need help, I would be really receptive to receiving it. I take this stance to others as well, usually if others do not ask for help, I won't offer it, and if they do ask for it, I'll gladly help.Lately because of this, it sparked some friction between my friends and I. They would accuse me of not offering help, to which I would rebut with ""if you need help, why don't you ask for it? Or else I would trust that you didn't need help what"" or something similar. My friends go on to say that this is just me making up excuses for not helping, and I do not understand this?? Aren't we all adults here? If you need something, why not ask for it instead of expecting others to offer it?  Perhaps I have terrible EQ skills and I would like to work on this, because clearly this mindset would affect me and my relationships in the future. Am I being selfish?

For those that are asking me to complete my education, I am currently studying for my degree while my bf is working in a job where he does not see himself working in that industry for the next 5 years, and did not like the course he took in poly.

97713,"My friend seems to be strung along by a guy she had a crush on since long ago. They have been together for about half a year and she was the one who asked him out,the situation sounds real similar to a post made earlier on .The guy in question never seemed to have plans for their future and always finds some sort of excuse to divert the question whenever long term commitment is being talked about.They would get into fights due to this, but the guy would always manage to sweet talk her back. He would not treat her very nicely, but would always seem to have changed for the better, only to revert back to a heck care attitude once things have stabled down again .My friend probably has a gut feeling that he is not serious about her and would frequently question herself and feel alone and burnt out from trying to maintain the relationship. Having trust issues, not seeing the result she wants But after everything, she seem to feel that he loves her , how he connects well with her etc and she would be giving him gifts and so on to keep him around. She had spent thousands on this particular guy over a span of around half a year. As an outsider, it is very obvious that she is being strung around and getting used. I have met the guy in question, and he gives off the feeling that he just wants to enjoy the moment but not have long term commitments. He is quite well spoken and seem to know how to sweet talk/ small talk , he works in a job that requires him to be able to teach or talk to people. I suppose he needs to keep up his looks and talk well for his ricebowl and my friend just got smitten. Our clique and even her parents confronted her about this, trying to help her see the truth that he is exploiting her affections for his own gains ,but she would find excuses to justify everything.Excuses that are borderline crazyTo the point where she had a fight with her parents and shut out everybody who tried to help. She had lost many friends, quit hobbies and fully became a housefly that flies around that guy.Is there anyway to wake her up from her daydream and see the truth?It sucks to see her suffer everytime those fights happen and she pretty much compromises and do things to make the guy stay and the guy just needs to put up an act and accept the ""apology"".

I mean it's his money I can't control who he lend to right. But it actually hurts me so much because the fact that he hide it from me. The reason I'm so frustrated is because that friend of his is not even his close friends??? And is someone I have never heard of, after all these years together with him. His reason of hiding - Scared I will nag at him for lending his friend money. His friend is a female and I think he is afraid I will be jealous. I have my fair share to be jealous tbh. He never even spend that much on me before and yet he lend this money to his friend without much thought??? It's not like as if he is super rich or what, all this is his hard earned money. I understand that his friend is in a bad financial situation, and he really lend out of good will. But why make it so shady by hiding from me? I emphasized so much in this relationship that I want everything to be transparent. This is not the first time he ""choose not to tell me"" cause he don't want me to nag or scared I will be jealous. HELLO but when I found out the truth, it just hurts so much. I'm not willing to let go of this relationship because it's not like as if there's a third party's involvement. But I'm not sure how should I approach this if something similar happened again. To me it is a deal breaker, because very often hiding leads to lying, and lying will eventually leads to deceiving. I do not want our relationship to be toxic by constantly paranoid over him lying to me. I trust him so much but right now my trust to him is never the same again.

97702,"Hi admin please don't filter this out. Really need to get this off somewhereim 20/F and my bf is 22 in the army. He recently graduated as a sergeant? We have been together for about 7 months and we met through tinder. He is to me perfect and always give in to me whatever the circumstances is. In fact i feel guilty being with him as he has always treat me with so much love while on the other hand, i always show him attitude. However to be honest, in the first place, we are 2 very different people leading different life. Firstly, I'm a Christian while he is not. I tried to ask him to attend church service with me over the weekend when he book out but he has never been interested to attend. Only once did he attend and that was only because i was going to be at church the whole day.Secondly, i'm in NUS while he doesn't have any uni placing at the moment as he did not do too well in poly. Till now, he still doesn't know what he wants to do in future and that worries me.Also, i feel like we don't get to spend much time together. Throughout this 7 months, i'm only able to see him only during the weekends. Sometimes we get to spend the whole weekend together and at times we spent only a few hours together. I really love him but it just sucks so much to wait for 1 whole week just to spend so little time and every time he books in, the same whole cycle repeats itself. its really frustrating. Sometimes when he is free, he will ask to go out with his friends or army mates. I feel like we are already spending so little time together as a couple, why does he still want to meet them just to drink or whatever. Furthermore, idk why is he always feeling tired. It's like he gets to sleep in camp after training but whenever he books out, he still complains that he is tired.While i really love my bf, i really dk is he the one for me given that even at this relatively early stage, we already have so much differences. After speaking to my parents, they advised me not to date during this period while im studying as he will be  a distraction. To add on, i recently met this guy who is my senior in NUS and is about to graduate with good grades.

97697,"This might come off as being an asshole but...I have been with my current girlfriend for very long. I am kind of a reserved guy (but kinda talkative when we're close), so when I picked up the courage to confess to my girlfriend >5 years ago, I was shocked that she agreed to be an item. Fast-forward to the present, we're comfortable with each other. We leave time for each other, talk to each other on a daily basis, celebrate occasions etc. We've always talked about settling down in the future (about marrying and getting a house, children), and now that it creeps ever so slowly closer, I have been having dreams about not committing. What I mean by not committing is not cheating. I have never been in serious contact with another girl ever since we got together, just during projects and stuff. My girlfriend and I have pretty different personalities and ideologies. She is less structured in life and likes social media drama, gossip etc. I do still listen to her and try to understand what's going on but they are not my interests. My interests are in world affairs (ethics, politics), or like hypothetical made up situations (idk one random example would be like the ethics of a panopticon, and understanding other's perspectives, one of the reasons why I like to read books). We do talk about my interests sometimes, but not at the depth I'd like. You can say that they are just dreams, but they have been coming over and over, over a period of a few months and its seriously bringing me closer to a mental breakdown. These dreams are me with another girl (the girl changes in these dreams. Sometimes its a primary school friend, sometimes its a secondary school friend. Both of whom I have not kept in contact with.) The dreams are nothing fancy, but rather just me just chatting with them. But whenever I wake up, I start to doubt my relationship. I cherish this relationship. We've been through ups and downs, but if I were to marry her and get bored of each other due to the differences being too much, I'd honestly stop wasting her time. I'd rather be alone than keep her in this relationship.-#97697: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97697","['Like: 23 people', 'Sad: 8 people', 'Wow: 3 people']",25 Comments,6 Shares
97696,"There is always someone who go down the slippery slope of “biological differences” to justify unequal gender obligations. In any case, barring elite military branches such as commandos, most girls of average physique should be able to serve reasonably well. You don’t need superhuman strength to hold a rifle and shoot someone. Ask Israel etc., they tried and its possible. (and the reason why females are not put in combat roles are NOT due to “genetics”)If you argue based on “biological differences”, that the natural sexual dimorphism has significant bearing on suitability to do certain jobs (in this case, NS vocations as “jobs”), justifying why women should not go into armed forces, then do you realise what it also means? It is well known scientifically that sexual dimorphism does not stop at physique. Male and females’ brains are different too. In terms of behaviour, sexual dimorphism exists also. If “biological differences” are that pronounced that we could excuse females from NS, does not mean that there are well paid prestigious male dominated careers that females are simply “genetically unsuitable” (based on the same slippery slope logic)?How coincidental that “biological differences” only applies to things that females dislike? And when they dislike NS for reasons such as “its too tough”, does that not reinforce the societal expectations of women, the same thing that feminists are so eager to abolish in areas that suit them? It’s hypocritical to hide behind “biological differences” to escape from obligations that no one likes, but at the same time, denouncing it when justifying for minority quota or other privileges to access beneficial career opportunities.-#97696: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97696","['Like: 14 people', 'Haha: 2 people', 'Wow: 2 people']",5 Comments,2 Shares

97683,"Coming to the issue of girls serving NS, I would like to share my thoughts on this.Firstly people might argue that girls are biologically different and might not be able to handle the physical hardships in the tough environment. No doubt this may be true to certain extent, but I will say that it only holds for some girls. Why do I say that? Reason being, there are girls out there who are fit enough to lift weights, so carrying a weapon might not be of any difficulty to them, not even running since there are many fitspo gals out there who can run as fast as guys. (East Coast Park etc) These are in fact the girls who should join the combat unit.Another reason is that the girls in our generation are growing taller beyond 170cm. Before I get flamed on this, allow me to point out that being tall has always been a symbol of masculinity for guys. Since there is this gender equality thing, it should hold for the tall ladies as well who can be perceived as strong Amazons, doing their part to contribute to the nation.(The reason why I claim this is I myself is 170cm tall as well and I do observe my surroudings and there are many girls at my eye level so they should be around this height.) Instead of eat drink and making merry in shopping centres or restaurants, they should do their part to help guys out in NS and not waste the vertical space on this small tiny dot.Coupled with the fact that we are facing an ageing population with large no. of boomers, we need even more manpower to boost our defence capabilities especially from the younger generation where tall ladies can play their part.Some xenophobic people may ask why not the foreigners serve NS? Well the reason is simple. Your own country you protect yourself. They have already done their part to boost the economy, otherwise we wouldnt have the luxury of enjoying today.So it is not just guys who should serve, it should in fact be made mandatory for tall or fit girls to serve as well to prove their worth. Short girls are excused. Sorry.-#97683: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97683","['Like: 19 people', 'Haha: 18 people']",29 Comments,5 Shares

I’m taking As this year and my boyfriend is waiting to start uni. We meet once every week, it may seem like a lot but it’s usually very late into the night like 9pm/10pm and we just have sex or something sexual. He always says that he actually planned something, but never got to execute it because “hormones got in the way”. I was fine with it, let’s just take it that it was just a more physical form of communication or in the heat if the moment. But, it started happening consistently, every week rinse and repeat. Even if I had more time to spare for him, he never brought me on nice dates ever since the first time we engaged in something sexual. I would think that at the very least, we could talk a bit more on text.   He just texts me when he feels like it and leaves me hanging whenever one of his friends texts him. There was this one time he was even on a call with one of his girl friends for over an hour, comforting her when he knows that that girl is into him.

From the start our conversations flowed really smoothly and naturally and we had many common interests and topics to talk about. When we went on our first date, everything seemed to go pretty well too - we had lunch & coffee, conversation flowed as well as it did when we texted, and he even showed me around his childhood neighbourhood. I thought it went well, and i was looking forward to hanging out with him again. But it's been a week since we went on our first date and I haven't heard from him since, no follow up texts or anything. Should I reach out to him? and if so what should I say? or is his lack of texting a clear sign that he's just not interested and i should just move on?-#97680: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97680","['Like: 9 people', 'Wow: 3 people', 'Care: 1 person']",20 Comments,2 Shares

97671,"TLDR: Busy gf, bf doesn't seem to understand, how?My bf and I have very different educational background, he currently doesn't have a job and is still in search of one, while I've been working for a while already, in an agency. :"") If you're in the marketing/advertising/media industry you'll understand how tiring it is and how work-life balance is really difficult to manage when you work in agencies. On top of my day job, I have my own side-hustle, and on top of that, I'm constantly upgrading myself by signing up for courses, which means any time I get out of my usual working hours (I OT quite a bit) is used up. I try my best to accommodate to him and meet him as often as I can, I still meet him 2-3 times a week, at least for dinner, or stay over at his place, but it's really tiring for me, because to me, his home is not my home, his bed is not my bed, and it makes a difference. I don't even have much time to spend on my own, relaxing and doing things I enjoy, and yet if I choose to not spend an extra day with him, he gets upset and tries to think of ways to get me to meet him or stay over. I'm working hard because this career path is something I really wanted, I still have a huge uni debt to pay off, and my pay isn't enough to help me pay it off quickly, so I do freelance on the side to finance my loans as well, I take on courses because I believe they will help me gain an advantage when my bosses consider employees for a promotion, or maybe these skills and knowledge can help me get a higher pay.  Sometimes I just wish to have one entire week to myself to rest but when I bring it up, my bf gets upset. I have my own family, we're not married yet but he doesn't seem to understand that my family will get upset if I keep spending so much time away. I have no idea how to tell him this nicely and get him to understand, we've fought over this multiple times but every single time, because I don't dare and don't know how to put it across, I end up giving in and squeezing time out for him again, sacrificing my rest and all. I go home late on weekdays just because he wants to spend more time together, and then I end up having to take a cab to work the next day because I didn't get enough sleep and I can't wake up in time. Aside from this, he is a very caring and loving bf, he takes care of me, is super loyal and devoted, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, only plays games with me, doesn't look at girls, don't follow female influencers, he is like the nicest guy ever, just that he's super clingy and just can't seem to be away from me.

Actually I always wanted to keep myself busy because I have no partner to spend my time with, friends, I started to feel distanced away. So. yes I met someone I valued as important, but he doesnt really value much of my existence. He never initiated much outing with him, but days when I am busy, I felt guilty not having the time for him, or put in it another way, I want to see him although I am busy and tired. I truly understand how it feel and what people meant when they say no matter how busy a person can be, he/she will still make time for the important one. So, I actually didnt know what I need to do. I had too much of a ""down"" with him , but as he being an important one, even if there is one ""up"" moment, it seem to fade all the ""down"" moment. I am not important to him, so each time when we have good times together ( I enjoyed myself always), I often ask myself, is this our end. Should I end this ""relationship"" with him. Am I already satisfied with some ""memories"" with him? Each time I asked myself, maybe, maybe I can stop thinking of ending and just enjoy every little moment. But being an emotional person, I dont think I can stop thinking, when will this feeling of ""up and down"" end, because it is very exhausting. And so, I am really busy with work lately, although works had really started to drain me, and start to fade my smile, my cheerful self, it can make me move on from him, unknowningly.

97656,"When I first entered uni, I became fast friends with a girl in my course since we attended orientation together. We were both attached back then and our partners are in other unis. This girl and I have the same group of friends, so no surprise we hang out with each other a lot. My then girlfriend felt suspicious that I was always texting her and going out with my uni friends when I’ve always been someone who rather stay at home. It was then I realised that I developed feelings for my friend. On her part, she was constantly breaking up and getting back together with her boyfriend, and often relied on me for support during these hard times. Eventually, her boyfriend became aware of me and maybe at some point of time, I could have been the reason for their on and off relationship. I distanced myself from her which resulted in a lot of conflict between us, but I was determined to make things work between my then girlfriend and I. Ultimately, the hurt I caused my then girlfriend was too much and she ended things with me after 4 years together. The guilt I felt towards my then girlfriend was overwhelming, I would cry every time I think about what I put her through. It took me about 2 years before I could stop hating myself. Throughout these 2 years, as I was single, I managed to mend my friendship with this girl. While I continued to provide her with support when she needs me, I also reminded myself that she is still attached. We mostly meet to attend classes, eat meals, or study together. We hang out outside of uni probably once a month at best. There were times where this girl tells me to go and date, but honestly, I fear that I would put through another girl the same pain I put my ex through. It took me so long to be comfortable enough to share my mistake without breaking down, and to be honest, I don’t actually think I forgive myself. Anyway, last year, this girl broke up with her boyfriend for good. The dynamic between us never changed until recently, where we started hanging out outside of uni on a weekly basis. A part of me feels that I don’t want to give up on her after all the shit we’ve been through, hence why I stayed by her side all these while. Maybe all these while, I’ve been waiting for her, but I deny that to myself. But there were times where I look at her and I feel that we are not compatible and it’s impossible for us to be together. I’m not entirely sure. Though I’ve never said it explicitly, I’m sure she’s well aware that I am interested in her. I have asked her before if she was looking to date, months after breaking up. She replied that she would like to stay single because she’s not ready for a relationship. My friends say that she’s only making use of me for the attention because if she really likes me, she would have left her ex boyfriend long ago for me. On top of that, they say that that’s a common excuse given to hint that girls give when they are not interested. So now I’m second guessing the reason for her meeting me every week. Could it be because she’s single now and seek validation, or perhaps she’s interested in me? I honestly don’t know what to do with this entire situation. It’s been years and I feel like I never got to see the end of it.-#97656: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97656","['Like: 3 people', 'Wow: 1 person']",10 Comments,0 Shares

I tried to hate him, for his actions hurt me a lot but then I couldn’t. I still thought the best of him. I preached about wanting to just stay single and that I am not suited for a relationship which in turn saw me turning down a few guys and escaping from situations when the other party tries to go deep or take things up a notch. There’s still so much I want to know about him and for him to find out about me but at the same time doubting what could possibly happen or re-live the same ghosting incident. I guess it's better to lie low, reminiscing silently and hope to forget him than to chat him up only to waste each other’s' time and risk getting hurt again. Right?

Please don't laugh, but I want to work for the ministry of foreign affairs, ideally as an ambassador or somewhere along those lines. As of now, I have two potential routes I could take, but I'm not sure which is better. Option A: Sign on to SAF after uni (or another uniform group) and after about 10-15 years of service, retire and get my foot into the government service door. This may sound like a stupid idea to most, but the idea of military service and protecting one's country has always appealed to me, and I would be willing to undergo all the xiong training just to reach my end goal. If any ex-regulars (doesn't matter which org.) can give some insight into post-service employment especially in the government sector, would be great. Option B: Try (and potentially fail) to get MFA midterm scholarship while in uni, which will inevitably secure me a bond with MFA post graduation. This might seem like the obvious choice, but what is the career progression like for this option, compared to the first? Also, is Option A a viable (and the best) way to go in the case Option B fails?Apologies for the long read, and I know it's a stupid dream, but it's my dream.-#97645: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97645","['Like: 8 people', 'Love: 1 person', 'Care: 1 person']",8 Comments,0 Shares

I don't ever compare the two of them, its just hanging around him for a year has made me developed feelings, especially when he has always been helping me with my academics. Now that Summer has started, we don't see each other as much but I still long to see his texts and want to hang out.

I understand that people might say that he is backing off because I am attached, but I never intended to get together with him or anything, just remain as friends. This topic is so hard to talk to people about especially because I am attached and I fear people will judge me. Most people won't even want to hear me out and immediately say Im in the wrong.

If I am really planing to study uni, I will most probably choose something that is not related to the job that I want (cause to study for the sake of doing it + my poly gpa is not so good)I mean I am willing to take a diploma pay but at least I am exploring more on the field and also improving my skills/ what I want in life for 4 years Reason why my parents want me to go:1) they never go before uni, they 16 years old alr stop schooling, around sec4 thus they don’t want me to end up like them - meaning - starting with a lower salary + ppl will take advantage of you cause you only have poly cert.2) they look up to my relatives cause they all go uni but the thing is that they went to jc so need to go uni.-#97637: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97637","['Like: 3 people', 'Sad: 1 person']",7 Comments,1 Share
97636,"Hi Admins pls dont filter this out, just felt like reflecting on some stuff. For some reason when me and my ex broke up i didnt grief as much as i did in a previous relationship, and thinking about it i felt it may be because i know i deserve alot more than what she had to afford, which were just bare minimum or sometimes even not. She was broken when she entered the rs and i tried my best to help her and ""fix"" her but in the process had also lost myself. She doesnt rly make me feel loved, i receive the most dry ""gd morning"" text from her, it doesnt seem like she is excited to spend time with me too and never once gave me any reassurance, especially since she hangs out with alot of guys and even go out 1 on 1 afew times, and im not talking about sweet text(which NEVER happened ONCE throughout the time we dated). She also wears shirts that belongs to other guys which i personally feel is unacceptable( i wld understand if it was a new shirt given as a gift). She's lowkey a gold digger also because i realise i always end up spending at least half of whatever money i have each month on her. And while im taking time to heal now she's going ard seeking affirmation from other guys trying to fill the void i left which is kind of toxic in my opinion. That doesnt bother me though because her next relationship wont end up lasting seeing how she treats the whole situation and she'll probably end up continuously filling that void till she finally wakes up and realise her own mistakes. At least i get to laugh at her glow down while i have my glow up and watch my bank account grow and eventually find someone else to give the world to and spend my money on. And if she sees this i hope she'll realise that it is her loss because someone who she once complained about being poor is now 10 times richer and she lost someone that would do anything for her while all i lost was someone who couldnt give me the simplest words of affirmation. You may think u got the better end of the breakup but deep down you know u've messed up;)-#97636: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97636","['Like: 13 people', 'Haha: 2 people', 'Wow: 1 person']",10 Comments,2 Shares

97630,"I am having an upsetting issue with my marriage and I wish just to have a discussion with helpful commenters here.I am married to a woman whose older brother has inherited their parents' business. Let's just say he makes a shitload of money and I don't know how much he earns. He lives in a landed detached near Nanyang Primary School. It's worth mentioning that that company is split 90/10 between my brother-in-law and his mother. My father-in-law is dead, never met the guy. My wife got a 3-bed condo from her dad. We live in it now.My wife is a housewife. She became a housewife ever since we had our first child. Now we have 2 children, aged 5 and 2. I don't make a lot of money (I'm a civil servant), and my wife is uniquely high maintenance. Although I would be lying if I didn't also say that she has changed a lot since we met in uni. In those days, she would walk into ION, spend a couple thousand dollars in a few hours, and call it ""therapeutic."" I made it very clear to her when we were dating, repeatedly I might add, that I am low SES and she was the one who agreed to still go out with me, eventually agreeing to marry me. Recently, because of the stress of raising my two children, she has started to ask for significantly more money to spend. She started going back to cafes with her friends at Orchard, something she has stopped doing for a long time, and she has started buying branded stuff. The cost of raising children has also been more expensive than I had predicted. But to be completely honest, if I reduce my savings to negligible numbers, I can support both my wife's lifestyle and all the household expenses. I don't make a lot but I think I am comfortably middle-income. The thing is I want to save up for retirement. I think it is my responsibility to save up for retirement because I do not believe in asking anything from my children. So for a few months, I have told my wife that I have not enough money to give her apart from what I usually give her. We didn't use to fight. But we have fought more in the past 6 months than our entire history together combined.I think 2-3 months ago, she started having money to spend all of a sudden. She could buy all her branded stuff, go to cafes etc. A few weeks ago, we went to Takashimaya and my son saw this $500 toy that he really wanted. I obviously told him no. I didn't have the budget for it. He threw a tantrum and I held my ground, as I have always done. Without hesitation, my wife just came over and told him ""daddy doesn't have money, mummy buy for you."" I got so angry I just drove home, leaving them all behind.Two days ago, I finally found out my wife has been getting money from my brother-in-law. I found out by accident because she left her iBanking session active when she was cooking. In that past 5 months alone, my brother-in-law sent her $20,000 a month. Ok, let's just get something straight here. I don't have a good relationship with my BIL. He is really smart and really rich. Because I always feel very insecure about how smart I am, I always try to sound smart during family dinners. But he frankly just knows so much about so many things once he starts talking everyone just listens to him explain shit. It is frustrating and I really don't like being around him. So I can't talk to him about leaving my family business to me because I'm sure he would just say it's his money and he can give it whomever he wants.I talked to my wife about the money she's been receiving, and how we should review our household finances and she was adamant in saying that the money her brother sent to her is ""her brother's money,"" earmarked for ""her to spend"" and I'm not allowed to have a discussion on how it constitutes an increase in our household income.I'm not angry at the money that she's been getting. I'm just upset that I get the sense that my wife has lost all respect for the kind of money I make, the type of work that I do, and the person I am. For example, she'd suggest a place to have dinner, like a really expensive place, and I stopped being able to use the excuse that we cannot afford it because she'd say it's her treat. I feel like nobody respects me in the family and I don't even know what to feel anymore.-#97630: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97630","['Like: 77 people', 'Sad: 75 people', 'Care: 49 people']",131 Comments,42 Shares
97624,"Should people who have spent too long in the SAF be considered good candidates to be leaders of private sector corporations?I spent quite some time in two highly profitable American corporations, where the spirit of constructive defiance of authority has been prized. Company executives have developed a culture of asking for opinions from the most junior employees in a meeting, so that fresh ideas can be thrown out and debated on in a sort of safe space. Project managers are also given ample room to test out their own solutions. Even though they risk being fired if they do a bad job of it, if their solutions work, they are rewarded handsomely. Here's the thing, even though the leaders know of the risk that project managers will do a bad job, for the most part, they create an environment that ensure merit, true merit, gets discovered. The SAF has a way of doing things, but the way the SAF does things is almost completely contrary to how a profitable corporation should do things. I have heard ex-SAF generals being lauded by party leaders for having led organizations of many people, which makes them qualified to lead large organizations in any industry. But it does not constitute a skill to be put in a position where your followers are 100% obligate followers. In addition, SAF is an organization that does not have to be profitable. Thus, very few things are mission critical. When the chief does something wrong, especially in a country like Singapore, the consequences are far less severe compared to when the CEO of Intel makes a wrong move. That's why it is dangerous for such corporations to give too rely too much on the discretion of their decision-makers, and strongman decision-makers are rarely preferred.I move to keep anyone who has ever been a regular in the SAF out of any for-profit organizations entirely. We have seen what these people can do to NOL, SMRT, I honestly don't want to see it happening to SIA, SingTel, or DBS.-#97624: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97624","['Like: 72 people', 'Haha: 12 people']",14 Comments,11 Shares
97623,"Guy A and Girl B have been dating for 2 years. Recently, Guy A told Girl B that he feels that she is being self-absorbed and does not take care of him. Example he gave: he was busy with work and was sick (not infectious kind) but he still went ahead to meet up with his friends (for his dog’s socialization gathering). Yet he told her he didn’t have time to meet her. Girl B was upset about it and threw a fuss. In the past, Guy A would comfort her and make things better but now Guy A said he’s tired and does not want to have to deal with her emotional outburst. Guy A used to call every day after work if they can’t meet. But recently, Guy A stopped doing it after he said he feels she is self absorbed.Guy A accompanies Girl B for medical appointments, help her with her work woes, give advice on family drama (would stay up till 4am to hear her out if she has any issues), cooks for her or sends her food (but not every day - like once in awhile). But Girl B feels that he should be doing these things anyways and it’s his responsibility as a boyfriend so i he’s actually going above and beyond to be a good boyfriend. These are baseline expectations. He said that this shows her self-entitled mentality and he’s not sure of a future because (1) self-absorbed, (2) self-entitled, and (3) he wants to feel taken care of as well. Girl B disagrees that she is self-absorbed or self-entitled though she acknowledges that she may not be very good at taking care of him.He said that women are into equality these days (similar to what a previous poster wrote) yet women don’t step up and look after the guys. Instead, they want to be pampered (nothing wrong with that) just that they need to not be double standards about it. I read somewhere about how you want your guy to treat you like a queen, you have to treat him like a king too.Question: how do you girls look after your guys?

97621,"Admin….hope you can don’t filter this…..because I need some answers.TLDR: I just don’t understand how I always seem to piss my guy friends off. And it always happen with the ones whom I’m closer with. Like for Guy A, we gotten really close; close as in will chat ABIT(maybe 10 msgs) almost everyday, will meet in GROUPS(got girls/guys) every week or every fortnight. But we almost never meet alone because I had promised my SO that I will try to avoid meeting guy friends alone in order to avoid misunderstandings. I’m happily married and everyone knows that. With my guy friends, we are also always prim and proper – no touchy touchy, no hold hands, don’t lean on each other, basically no skin-ship. After meet-ups, I also go home myself instead of letting them fetch me home. I always pay my own share too. I also call them by proper names, not “bii”, not “dear” and definitely nothing like “miss you” that sorta msgs. Guy A tends to ask me where I’m going on weekends and I usually don’t hide anyway. And gradually it became a habit for him to ask me where I’m going, doing what and meeting who. As we are good friends, I will just answer, for e.g, I will say I’m meeting my colleagues to drink, etc. Sometimes, when some messages are just before bed time, generally we will “good night” each other. Once, I didn’t reply his question on whether I’ve reached home after drinks, the next day he threw tantrum at me. I was shocked but I explained nicely I’m merely too tired. Things were back to normal but slowly, it became a daily routine which I grew abit tired of. So 1 day I told him why it’s like I’m reporting to him and I told him I’m not a kid. I was finally fed up and told him I’m just going to stop the daily “reached home” and “good night” reporting. Then he broke down and cried, saying he’s just worried about me as they are guys around who drinks. I felt bad and apologized… Sigh….then somehow more and more things popped up where he will get angry with me. I’m the kind who “eat soft don’t eat hard”, so whenever he’s fierce with me, I will argue back. But whenever when I’m too harsh then he will…be sad and affected. I will again get soft-hearted and pacify him again. It’s such a vicious cycle that I’m getting crazy.Then there is Guy B whom I’m also close with; our closeness is quite the same as Guy A – meet in groups quite frequently, hardly meet alone, prim and proper, but we hardly chat with messages. But the difference he has with Guy A is he has very strong pride. Which means our arguments can get very heated. But I really don’t understand why does he gets angry with me so easily either? There was once where I bailed out of a group meet up because I was too tired, he got angry with me. I’m so sure if it’s the other guys, he will definitely not mind at all because it happened before. He threw a fit by messaging me a few whatsapp pages until I had to make a trip down. There was another time where he also threw tantrum at me by scolding me via whatsapp continuously for an hr just because I sided with another guy friend in a game of cards. Sometimes I see other girls drop mild sarcastic jokes in jest, he can laugh and refute back but if it’s me, it’s as if volcano erupts. What the hell man…..Everytime we quarrelled about these minor stupid stuffs(everytime is him getting angry), sometimes he apologized, sometimes he doesn’t. THEN, it became so bizarre that he tried various ways to get me angry or hurt me by hurling really mean and condescending remarks infront of all our friends. I have generally a good temper(or rather, I’m just very bo-chup) but even so, I’m getting kind of exasperated through time! It's getting kinda ridiculous when he started to say things he don't mean, like ""I don't wanna see you!"" but still continues to ask me out. Sometimes I really dont know what he wants. I don’t really apologize to Guy B since he’s always malicious while scolding me, unlike Guy A who somehow explained his actions are for my own good and that I’ve hurt him etc. Since I've typed so much, then might as well! There’s also something which I don’t understand. There’s a Guy C whom suddenly out of nowhere said “You don’t matter to me at all” in a flat, normal tone kinda voice when he was intoxicated. I was stunned, said nothing but I was thinking like “What?!”. I’m thinking he must be drunk so I also didn’t say anything much. But it happened again on another group outing where he said again “You are not important to me at all”. Seriously??!! ,=)’’’ It’s so bizarre as I thought we have always been okay friends and he is usually very nice. Oh Common…. I know I’m not important nor matter to him but really necessary to say right to my face meh……it’s so embarrassing, and kinda hurting too.Why I have a feeling Guy B and Guy C just want to make me feel bad when I didn't really offend them at all........So what’s wrong? Anything wrong with me? Like why all this kept happening? I’ve consulted my female friends before and most of them generally asked me to give up the friendship to spare myself of all the frustration – there is that, but I just wish to know where’s the problem, else it’s going to happen again whenever I get close to a guy friend. To me, guy friends and girl friends are both equally important and the same to me. Is there any way to stop all this? How to…make guys stop…how to say….. – they seemed to take my words/opinions/presence abit too seriously or I will just somehow unknowingly piss them off whatsoever. Geez….I have so much phobia now until I dare not talk too much to other guy friends in case we get too close and such things happen again. I’m usually a happy-go-lucky and sunshine kinda girl. -#97621: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97621","['Like: 12 people', 'Haha: 10 people', 'Care: 4 people']",37 Comments,1 Share

97617,"My bf and I have been tgt for close to a year now. Both of us are working shifts so it’s quite flexible to meet up a few times in a week. I do see a future with him but there’s some issues that’s bothering me and I’m not sure if this would pose a problem in the future. I’m a person that has my phone with or beside me all the time n would reply almost immediately. One thing that bothers me is that whenever he has free time n we are chatting, suddenly out of nowhere he would just disappear. And the next thing I see is he’s online on FB. For the next few mins there will be no replies, then finally some messages n gone again. Whereas for me if I’m on phone or doing some other things, if his messages come I’ll immediately open. Is this a matter of prioritising or idk how to put it. I understand that during work there will be busy times, but when you’re finally free or have breaks, don’t u wna squeeze in abit to text your SO n chat abit? This happened many times n often I tell myself to just close one eye n do my stuffs, if he replies then so be it. Another thing is his family. His family is generally quite nice to me, never felt so welcoming before. The issue is about money, where they would sometimes borrow from him and till date none is returned back. Y’all may think like since it’s family, don’t have to be so calculative. Small amounts maybe forget it, but imagine lump sum like 4 digits? It’s his hard earned bonus money, and gone like a snap. I don’t see a chance of it being returned altho they promised to because it’s such a large amount. He don’t earn a lot also, and still gives allowance, leaving a tiny bit to the savings. Im not sure if this will be an issue in the future because money is impt and we have to think about housing.

97615,"To the OP of #97608, I feel that communication might be an issue between you and your girlfriend. My girlfriend of 3 years is quite similar to your girlfriend too, but to be honest neither do I see myself being replaced by a dog, nor thinking that she is being overly nice to her dog. She used to have a Labrador, but after it passed, she is now having a corgi too, and since it’s small, she can easily bring her everywhere, and this is where my concern comes in.I believe everyone views things differently. Some people may think that feeding your dog with average meal, bath your dog regularly, walk your dog on a daily basis, all these are sufficient to be a good dog owner, but some people take this to the next level by treating their dogs with kibbles, pricey food, baby pram, dog clothes, monthly grooming, which really incur shitload more money. Basically the OP has nothing against his girlfriend’s dog, but rather has concern on her spending that makes it difficult for them to settle down by buying house, getting married, etc.Frankly speaking I feel that bringing your dog out to nice places once in a while is fine, which is what my girlfriend does as well, but if she does it so often, together with the large amount of money incurred that actually affect your relationship, then you should really talk to your girlfriend about it. My girlfriend used to be like yours, she brought our corgi everywhere, literally EVERYWHERE including hawker, marketplace, etc. I actually felt that she has overdone and misunderstood the meaning of love for your pet, so I told her about it and elaborated whatever that bothers me. Like sometimes I find it quite burdensome to bring him out because 1. We had to keep watching him to prevent him from acting aggressively out of a sudden or running away from us, 2. We had to find a pet-friendly or outdoor non-air-conditioned places to dine in, 3. Due to the fact that we can’t bring pets into shopping malls, our outings became café hopping, beach walking, sightseeing, and I could no longer enjoy walking in malls, 4. People beside our table tend to be more aware and away from us due to the fur. At some food courts, we’ve been confronted several times by people beside our table, telling us that our dog fur flew to their table. Some elderlies even yelled at us for dirtying the seat because we let our dog sit on the chair. I’ve also seen people requested to change table so that they can stay further away from us. I knew these are the consequences that I will faced, so I always tried to put a smile on my face and just apologized to them. However, I knew this really should stop, because relationship is about 2 parties, and it doesn’t make sense to me if my girlfriend enjoys frequently brings our dog out but I feel the burden and totally didn’t enjoy the outings at all. I eventually talked to her about it and we had several big fights, but now she understands my points and does it much less frequently as before. I’m not sure how your girlfriend spends her money, but my girlfriend doesn’t compromise our savings, because she doesn’t mind cutting down expenses on her food, cosmetics, entertainment, so I’m perfectly fine with that. Some corgi/dog lover may disagree with how I treat our dog, or I shouldn’t feel the burden if I really love my dog, but that’s your fxxking problem, and I wholeheartedly admit I love our dog, and I walk my dog every single day, I make sure he is well-fed, I make sure I play with him whenever I can, I do what I feel is right to love my dog, just not up to your expectations. Just because I don’t spoil my dog as much as you “dog lovers” do, it doesn’t mean I don’t love my dog. It’s like buying your kids PS4, LV wallet, ipad pro, supreme clothes, yeezy shoes, just so that your kids will be happy, but not everyone can afford such luxuries.

97611,"How often do couples go on dates in a week?My bf and I have been together for 8 months now, we met via a dating app and things progressed from there. In our initial days, we agreed to meet just once a week due to school commitments and wanting to give one another enough time to spend with our own separate groups of family and friends. However, now when we are no longer have school commitments and have both started working; have more cash and time to spare for one another, he still insists on meeting just once a week, and only meeting twice a week in the event of emergencies or as a 'make up' for not meeting up on another week. I feel that our relationship is very organised. On every date we went for, we would also plan ahead for the activities and food to eat on our next date. While I have asked him to meet up twice a week occasionally (not every week, perhaps once a month or once every 2 weeks) with the extra date just spending some time together for dinner instead of spending long hours together. He declined, saying that he would have no time for his family or friends if he were to do so. While he mentioned that we could meet twice a week when there's an emergency such as when I needed him over to help with something, there's always a reason for him not being able to be present when the situation calls for it (~3 times so far), such as he will be having dinner with his family/friends later hence he is unable to come over to help me etc. Sometimes he would only respond 4-5 hours later claiming he is asleep or playing games and did not realise I was texting him. Whenever I turned to my friends for help instead, they often wonder why my bf is barely available in this case. I'm starting to wonder if i am even a priority to him, or just a once-a-week commitment. I don't think I am asking too much just by increasing the frequency of meeting up to twice a week occasionally as most of my friends and siblings meet up with their S.O 4-5 times a week on average.-#97611: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97611","['Like: 36 people', 'Sad: 16 people', 'Haha: 8 people']",52 Comments,10 Shares
97608,"I really need to rant this out. I’m open to any possible good advice. Before I rant this out, I just want to let you guys know that I love pets, be it dogs or cats, or even smaller ones like guinea pigs or hamsters, and I have nothing against pets at all.My gf has a pet corgi, and as I mentioned earlier, I like dogs, so I love her dog as well, but I feel that my gf has gone too far in terms of treating her corgi to the point of where I think she treats her dog better than herself. Since this is her first pet dog, I thought it was okay to be treating her dog in such exaggerated ways, at least for the first few months, but apparently her dog’s 3rd birthday is coming up soon, yet I never see her stop splashing so much money on her dog.Not only does she buys her dogs snacks from pet shops that can easily cost like $20, she also feeds him with expensive meat like salmon together with branded dog biscuits. My gf doesn’t really take cab unless really necessary, but cos she is so into her dog that she wanna brings him to wherever she goes, and since public transport doesn’t allow pet, so she often takes cab just so that she can bring her dog along too. I actually asked her why can’t she just leave her dog at home, and guess what, she yelled at me for being a heartless person who has the gut to abandon our pet at home. She seriously thinks that leaving your dog at home when you’re out means you’re indirectly abusing your dog. When I told her, hey but you also leave your dog at home when you go to work, but she said that’s because she has no choice, else she’ll definitely bring her dog to work too. Besides that, she would also bring her dog to some outdoor or pet-friendly restaurants or cafes, including those at MBS cos according to her logic, her corgi will also enjoy the scenery and be delighted just like us. As you guys might have guessed, yes, as she dines at those restaurants/cafes, she would order extra so that she can feed her corgi with those expensive food as well. I kid you not, she even feeds him with steak from Bread street kitchen! You guys might be thinking oh well if that’s her money and she can afford, and she thinks that makes her dog happy, so that’s her business. The truth is her salary is slightly above 3k, and she is still paying off her uni bank loan, supporting her retired parents, and barely has any savings left every month. And also, sometimes I’m the one who pay for our bills but she still insists on ordering some meat of healthier choice for her dog. Right now we’ve been together for 2 years and we’re actually considering to settle down and buy a flat, but I have no idea how I should bring this up to her. I mean, it can’t be me the one who fully support the housing cost right? I don’t mind paying more than half of it, and in fact I tend to pay for our bills more often during outing. Given the fact that her corgi can easily spend up to $100-200 a week, I seriously think that she should be more logical and start thinking rationally for the sake of our future. I sometimes find her really childish for being so overly attached to the dog. She also gets all excited when kids run towards her corgi and start petting him or taking pictures of him. Any good advice peeps?-#97608: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97608","['Like: 53 people', 'Haha: 22 people', 'Angry: 5 people']",106 Comments,21 Shares
97605,"Hi all. I think my friend is somewhat delusional but i don’t know how to tell her. She believes she is a psychic/medium who can read ppl’s minds and claims she have spirit friends... I wanted to give her my support at first and tried to listen to whatever she has to say regarding her beliefs. I usually just listen without commenting much… But the more she tells me, the more i think she is just being scammed by the shops who are selling these things to her. For example, she bought a stone crystal (which can be found at taobao for $4, for over $1000 as apparently there is a spirit(like a vampire or something) inside which gives her powers). She also bought some spirits which doesn’t come with anything, claiming that it will be bound to her soul. She said she can see/hear the spirit and ask them to do things/favours for her… and she 100% believes it works.She even encouraged me to get a spirit but I don’t really believe in these things.. and I’ve made myself clear too.She is a very smart person in general, smarter than me i think… so idk how i can approach this topic with her while still being  respectful to her beliefs. Her partner also knows she is doing all these things, but he seems fine with it??? I am quite worried as she has spent probably more than 10k(very low estimate) on this “hobby”? Or should i not approach this topic at all and let her be? Thanks!-#97605: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97605","['Like: 9 people', 'Haha: 8 people', 'Wow: 3 people']",23 Comments,3 Shares

97602,"Now that I think about my JC and high school days, it seems that some teachers honestly take their jobs too seriously. Do some of them get a kick out of being rude and mean to teenagers? Don't get me wrong, being a teacher is a legitimate and respectable job, but some teachers really bring this ""I'm better than you"" mentality to their jobs. I had this teacher in high school who gained notoriety for being mean to every teenager. There was once I was asked to arrange the tables after school, and he told me that I could not go home until after he has come to make sure that the tables were in order. I waited in the classroom for 3 hours after school until he came, after held me there for an additional 2 hours. He would come to the classroom, tell me to think about what was wrong, without telling me anything else, and he would leave for an hour. By the time I reached home that day, it was 8pm. My parents were furious.My dad, who was a regional managing partner of an MNC at the time, found this completely unacceptable. He came to school the next day and demanded to meet this teacher. My teacher's justification for his ""punishment"" was so I could learn discipline. My dad told him straight in the face, ""I have greater ambitions for my son other than to become a teacher of children. If he follows your values that's where he will end up. This isn't discipline. This is just teaching my son how to be a slave."" I never saw that teacher again.I've now just graduated from an Ivy League university and my first job paid 200k USD in 2020, and I wonder if that teacher still thinks his antiquated army-style form of education is right. I'm sure many still do.-#97602: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97602","['Like: 67 people', 'Haha: 23 people']",37 Comments,12 Shares

97580,"Hi again, Im the OP of 97554. I have read thr the previous comments and hear to answer some questions: Im definitely given birth by my mom and dad. Im not adopted. ( tho i moght as well be). My younger sister who is adored is only 16 years old ( opening a company needs to be arnd 18 i think? ) so thats out of the question. They cant use my elder sister as well as she is currently overseas and my mom said it is inconvenient if any documents need to be signed, she wont be here. My elder sis and I are beaten up since young. But my younger sister is adored. Long story short. When me and my elder sis was young my father just started is company. So he was in a lot of stress ( what my mom said). So whenever he is stressed he took it out on me and my elder sis. Since young (even until now) i was told to just suck it up and understand that he is stressed, and that i need to respect him no matter what as at the end of the day, he is my father. Since my elder sis left singapore. I was the only one he can sorta vent his anger out on. One reason why my younger sister is able to get doted on because she knows when to go "" dadddddyyyy pls get this for me.... i want this"" (idk what 撒娇 is in english pls halp). I dont do it to him cos i feel disgusted. As for those who ask if i have anyone whom i can talk to. I have an amazing bf, friends and my grandparents. I dont talk to my grandparents about this however, because they tend to over worry about me which is really not good for their health. My bf tells me not to agree too. But i just need some other advices. I have not talk to my friend because i just dont want to burden them with this. Plus they wont be sure how to handle. ( told them about a similar situation before but theu dont really know... which i dont blame them at all!!!)As for moving out. I was planning to move out once i graduate. Just because it is a good timing to do that. I can finish my studies and then just walk away. My mom said i have to give them 25% of my salary the moment i start working (it is unfilial if i dont) but im leaving for good after my graduation. So i wont be giving them a cent. They have 3 other children so money for them isnt an issue. My dad has a huge amount of cpf as well. I am from nursing. So sponsorship money is used to pay my uni. (1000$ per month).  So i technically dont have enough money to move out as of now. But i will have a job almost immediately after graduation. So salary/finance wont be an issue once i move out after graduation. My dad was bankrupt due to other party not able to return them money for a certain project, resulting in him not able to pay his supplier. He did say that after is bankrupcy (he has 2 or 3 more years) he will change the name back to his own name. Hope this helps u guys understand the situation. I will be saying no to then definitely. But the reason why i am so anxious abt saying no is because of the shit attitude and treatment i will be facing once i say no. I so tired to deal with that because as you know asian family, u are the biggest SINNER if u dont help ur family members especially ur PARENTS.-#97580: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97580","['Care: 19 people', 'Like: 17 people', 'Sad: 5 people']",25 Comments,1 Share
97574,"Have been in NS for a few months now and my relationship is starting to take a toll on me.Obviously, I love my girlfriend and I see us getting married in the future. But her behaviour towards me whilst I am serving the nation has been very lacking.I try to text her everytime I get a chance to use my phone but she doesn’t seem to understand and appreciate the fact that I actually am unable to have my phone nor use my phone whenever I want to. Freedom is very limited here and it just doesnt seem to register in her.I am also often nagged at by her, being told things like im not doing things right or I couldve done xxx better. Being already tired to the daily training regime, her messages are often demoralising and I really dont appreciate her lack of encouragement and love.There has been times during lights out where she would unintentionally start a fuss (either at or not at me) right before I head to sleep and this often disallows me to go to bed on time and get ample rest. I would then have to stay up till she feels better before I feel like im allowed to go to bed. Initially, I thought it was fine because maybe she was unaware that I am tired. But this has been happening constantly and ive just so tired and I cant seem to tell her how I feel. Even on the topic of sex, she does not seem to realise that I am tired? I am expected to initiate and do ALL the work. Sometimes i would like it more if she would just give me a good time instead of the opposite.I thought it would be understandable that men serving NS are having a tough time adapting to the military lifestyle and through the physically intensive training.  All I want is for her to show me she loves me and supports me for what I do. To all women who have their significant other in the army, please do your part to tell them you love them and support them whenever you can. We do not receive a lot of emotional support other than from our loved ones being inside here.

97558,"I've met someone who I have gotten along with superbly. We flirt a lot and very often, though mostly in a joking manner, with a lot of physical touching given we're both touchy people. Recently, we've been spending a lot of time together, and I've found myself catching some feelings for her, especially since she's brought some much missed light back into my life. This is unfortunate, given she has a boyfriend (which I was only made aware of after a few months of us meeting, given she's mostly quiet on it, and is actually quite reluctant to mention his existence), though she's often communicated to me that she thinks it is only a matter of time before they separate given certain issues in their relationship. While this is obviously theoretically positive news for me, I do not wish to contribute in any way to their separation, and am extremely reluctant to comment on their situation to her, or act on my feelings in any form. But of course, it can be upsetting on my end finding myself in such circumstances, having to interact with her while keeping a lid on my feelings. Additionally, I sometimes worry that the time I spend with her, or that the joking-flirting might cross some boundaries, and lead to trouble down the road.While I would love to continue to be friends, given it has been a great deal of fun spending time with her, I am considering temporarily enacting the nuclear option to cut off contact with her in an attempt to suppress or diminish my feelings for her, and ensure no boundaries are crossed. I just wish to cause no trouble or drama, though it might potentially be a selfish course of action to do so. Obviously, I am unsure of what I should do, so I am here to seek out advice.

97554,"Hi, i have a pretty urgent issue that i need help with. Hope admin wont filter this. So background info. I was always violently beaten up by my dad, to the point he will use metal rods to hit me and throw chairs at me. He constantly verbally abused me, saying im useless and why dont i just go die. But me being in an asian household, i thought it was normal so i have to just suck it up. So it lasted till my 20s. As u can tell i wasnt his favourite... my sister has it totally different. She was adored and spoilt by my dad. Everything she wants she can have it. She can lash out at my parents and they wont even be angry. What a joke. So it has been a year since my dad ever talked to me. (Which honestly i couldnt care less... ) due to some trivial issues where he thinks i didnt help him in the way he wants me to. So since young we have the habit of greeting any elders whom we see. I greeted him initially. After almost a year... i stopped because i heard from my brother that my dad gives a disgusted look when i call him or when he sees me walk by. My mom scolded me for this. But she never understood me. Because if she did she will know i hate rejections and after being rejected with a disgusted look every single day for a year. Im so done with him or my family. So yesterday, i was the only one at home, and someone was at the door. I thought it was a mailman as i buy tonnes of shit from online shopping. When i was at the door, i saw my dad. So out of respect, i opened the door and greeted him. To my surprise, he acknowledged it. So that night i was kinda happy as i was like... is he gonna talk to me again (i hate him still, but as a daughter, i wanted to be acknowledged). At 4am in the morning, my mom came into my room (she wakes up arnd this timing) and told me she need to discuss something with me. So my dad needs to open a company. But due to him being  bankrupt, he cant use his name. So he has to use someone else. And u guessed it. He wanted to use mine. So it dawned on me that he greeted me because he needs me to do sth... so obviously I didnt wanted him to use. So i gave my mom an excuse that I was having a scholarship, so i wasnt sure if im allowed to do this. (It is a true reason tho). Then she said since im graduating next year, they can wait till next year. So i was like i cant give u promises. She then startes to guilt trip me by saying if i dont help, there is really no one else. Saying that i always dont help them when they are in need (which i do, but they dont care, do they). So i told her i will think about it. This morning arnd 8am she came into my room again and ask me to pass her my sponsorship contract  she will show it to their lawyer to see if i can open a company under my name despite me having the contract. So im at a loss. I definitely dont want to let them use. So can yall help me come up with a way to reject them. (Because if i reject. Im going to get hated for not helping once again). And if there is any law students, can you help me see if this is actually legal? Or will i have any consequences in my credit score etc as my parents are bankrupt. So im sure they cant open a company using their own name.-#97554: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97554","['Like: 36 people', 'Care: 23 people', 'Sad: 22 people']",77 Comments,14 Shares

I’ve currently been with my gf for about 2 years. She’s very attractive and hot, and I think people agree too as she’s got quite a following on Instagram last time before she deleted her account. I learnt a few months ago that she was seeing this other guy back then before we got together (who was already attach at the time) on the side, and they actually did it many times. To make matters worse she actually did very intimate things like swallowing his.. well you know.. she wouldn’t even swallow mine. I can’t help but constantly think about it, I mean firstly why wouldn’t she swallow mine?? Am I less attractive than the first guy?? and I found out from a friend of mine that she and that guy actually took videos of their acts together at the time (and this is also the friend who told me she swallows), and it’s like a ticking time bomb for me as to when these videos will surface. I can imagine someone doing a stupid prank on our wedding and airing the videos or something.On the surface I’m still trying my best to be gentle and attentive but I’m beginning to think that all this is because of how I find her physically attractive, which will eventually die off logically, especially since she is less intimate with me than with her “ex”.

I obviously do wanna date and have my first relationship, but is it worth it? Literally all the girls I’ve talked to just ghost, flake on dates, show interest for a while them lose interest. You get the point. It’s not like I’m socially inept, I’m not. I have friends, mostly guys, but the issue is about the dating / dating scene. And don’t get me started on the bias against guys (which I would probably see in the comments section) If a girl made this post, you’d be seeing tons of support from people / society saying “it’s ok, it’s not your fault. Men are trash etc.” but when a guy makes this “You not good enough for them. You’re not good looking enough. You’re not interesting enough. You don’t make enough money to show that you’re capable of dating.” What’s with this two faced, hypocritical nonsense? And this is a lot more common to hear here Anyways take online dating for an example, how good is it for anyone (especially guys) really? Statistics wise? There’s a very small minority of guys who actually manage to get matches, let alone dates, which then may or may not turn into relationships. Should I just be avoiding dating in general?

I muted you on all social media, to avoid seeing anything that is going on with your life.So reluctantly I said yes, but requested to keep things professional, due to me not wanting to affect the clique dynamics, so I put up a good front infront of everybody, but behind the front I was slowly sinking myself into saddness...I just can't stop thinking about you holding your boyfriend and smiling..leading to sleepless nights.Breakpoint 2, as I continued to keep things professional for a few months, intially I was slowly getting better, accepting what has happen, then you came and ask me why I was talking to you differently then before and saying that you feel off..., which made me cracked again..cause forcing myself to be professional was not easy..I send you a long message of what you did to lead me on, and you cried..and apolygise for everything that you had done to hurt me...In the heat of the moment I told you that I couldn't be friends with you anymore, but the following day we talked and trashed out everything, ending it off with saying that you think that I don't truly liked you...which after seeing that text... I lost all sense of emotions...how can you say that after...being there for you when you were having family problems, cheering you up, making you laugh, motivating you in your studies, giving you confidence...but without thinking I replied yes I don't like you, I just want to stop this thoughts that I have...I just want to move on and run away from all of this.I feel that I am unlucky to have met you, cause for once in my life where I failed many attempts in the past to get into relationship, I thought you were the one cause despite the fact that you leaded me on even when you were in a relationship, this one flaw I was willing to bypass cause I was able to talk to you, share with you what I was going through and finally found someone that shared the same values as me. I was not looking for perfection in you, as there is no such thing as perfection, and I am also flawed.Concluding, its time to let you go... I wanted to tell you this face to face but I guess for now I am not fully ready to tell you this:""Now your boyfriend is out of NS, I hope he gives you all the time, all the effort to make you happy, I hope he treats you well and be there for you at your low points, I hope you will be happy with him, as if I truly liked you I would want the best for you, and if he is the one that you feel that can give you the best, I am happy for you.""For me I am just trying to let go of you at this point, sometimes I feel I am okay sometimes I dont feel okay, I think I would only be able to truly move on after we end university where we go our seperate ways.-#97534: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97534","['Like: 16 people', 'Care: 12 people', 'Haha: 5 people']",22 Comments,6 Shares
97536,"Hi admin, please don’t filter I know this is a taboo topic but idk where to turn to.I’ve been dating my current bf for 5 months and I think he sexually assaulted me. Idk if I’m overreacting, you guys can be the judge. I was raised in a very strict household and it took me about a month to be comfortable to hold my bf’s hand. Yea I know it’s pathetic  im not comfortable with contact. Me and my bf booked a staycation at sentosa (this was about 3 months ago) and during this staycation, he touched me in my private places when he thought that I was asleep. I obviously woke up but I was too scared to do anything and I just froze. The next day, I was too awkward to bring it up so I just carried on like nothing happened. I cried in the toilet that morning cause I was so confused as to why a guy that I trusted, loved and respected me (he knows I’m very traditional) would treat me like this.When it happened for the second night, I was too scared to do anything but I gave some physical cues like turning away or pushing him slightly, but he just carried on anyway. He also kissed me when he thought I was asleep, this was my first kiss in my life and it was done to me without my consent. I was really upset because he asked for permission to kiss me when we started dating and I always said no. Mind you, it wasn’t the closed mouth kdrama kiss either, it was the sloppy af kind. I was so disgusted. I left on the third day by faking a family emergency. After the staycation, I sucessfully blocked the traumatic experience from my mind and everything went back to normal. Yes, I’m still dating him. I made excuses for him to why he would do this. I felt like the way I dealt with it was to pretend that it didn’t happen. I think I was in denial because I love him too much. But thinking back about the incident, I don’t think that what he did to me was okay. Am I crazy to feel this way?-#97536: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97536","['Like: 43 people', 'Care: 34 people', 'Angry: 31 people']",172 Comments,47 Shares

I find this very shocking, I always thought that Asian parents typically don't mind pretty much having their child around even past adulthood or even financially supporting them past adulthood.

97480,"Singaporeans, a majority of only worry about career and money and relationships the latter usually ignored. I graduated with a law degree overseas ten years ago, aged 31.I married a woman whom I loved a lot.At this time, I was living in a bungalow that my wife and I bought, I had a lucrative business on the side which I had sold a majority of.I secured a job at a law firm and after a year or so of 80-hour work weeks,I then secured a job as a counsel to a large MNC based in Europe. On a 2-year contract I left sg chasing a $1,200,000 a month job I was working 19 hours a day. I never replied to my parents calls nor my wife’s. I missed the birth of my son who died shortly after he was born.I didn't come back; I had no choice our firm was in the middle of a crisis.And I dare not face my family. To cover my grief, I kept working, I slept in the office and also sold off all my shares worth about $30,000,000 for $1 in the same I stared to my best friend, as she was the one I trusted the most to lead the firm also I had no interest in anything. After I had settled all the issues at work, I ended the contract and had to pay some money for ending it early, I also had to help find a replacement. I flew back the same day I handed in my letter to the firm.When I came home, I found a letter from my wife, she had left me, we then got a divorce. I did all this for my family they had a good life in my opinion. I sent my parents for holidays almost every month, I sent about. 50% of my income back to them. The remaining would usually be sent to charities. I paid of my sibling’s medical school fees too.And the rest to my wife, she got to live as a tai tai, over the years she spent almost $1,200,000 just on cars and Designer stuff.These are things I had no interest in but in my mind, I believed they kept my family happy. But no, I lost my family too. who moved overseas, they rarely spoke to me?I chased money the almost all the Cs except country club (totally hate most people there)All for my family, I think I never spent more than a day with them those few years.2 years ago, I found out form my in laws my wife had died (I will not specify how) but it was a dagger trough my heart, as I had intended to rekindle our love.I then wandered about for a year ...I have fixed my relationship with my parents who are now in their 70s, they are volunteer teachers, and they spend their time teaching students and helping build schools overseas, they had sold their own home to do this.I let go of everything 30% my money I put in a trust that will be used for charitable causes after I die 20%, I put aside for my SME that I founded to use, if I times of crisis. The remaining 50% I gave it away, I also gave away all the proceeds firm the sale of all my cars and homes and investments. I happy now, I help with my parents. And I work as a pro bono lawyer too.I still cry every night hoping I was not that rich that way my child may not have died. And my wife would be still with me.All the material stuff did not bring me any happiness, only for a second. After that no... just sadness What's worse is that I lost many good friends, and I didn't know and couldn't tell who my friends are back then.Please my fellow Singaporeans success Is best earned and achieved when you find true happiness and you have done your level best to contribute to society and made a positive difference in people’s lives. That will bring you much more happiness. Then any amount of money will.There is so much more to see and to do, let us not be blinded and distracted. by monetary and material gains Instead, please focus on your family, your children’s parents and passions you want to peruse. I hope we can start to value people better rather than who earns the most. or who has a degree or what not.I will give an example.In Singapore we see a Mercedes-Benz, oh wow we go that person must have lots of $$ and likely is successful. In Germany, people see a Mercedes-Benz, “oh look that's my taxi."" regards, A Singaporean who spent 40 years chasing something that truly does not bring value.-#97480: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97480","['Like: 436 people', 'Care: 135 people', 'Sad: 91 people']",85 Comments,188 Shares

97476,"I am so tired in my relationship.Last night my gf and I were on a date, and I was annoyed she was texting her friends during our date which I find quite disrespectful. Despite me expressing my displeasure, she did it multiple times. When I asked her was there an urgent matter, what was she texting about? She says ""forgot'. She even got super angry at me for daring to be upset that she is texting during our date. One childish move she did was when I was trying to take a photo of one of the dishes which just arrived, she immediately tore into it, as she saw me focusing with my camera. She also lashed out at me and said it must be my fault for being a boring person, which is why she texts on the date. She later retracted this statement and said it was said in a moment of anger, and the real reason she was texting was her friends and her were arranging a meetup for the next day.The next day I told her I barely slept the previous night due to me feeling hurt by a lot of hurtful untrue things she had said to me. She proceeded to verbally abuse me for the next 3 hours. Not only that, she flipped the tables on me and said I was the bad person because I got upset that she got upset at me. I feel so helpless. Over our 2 year relationship, everytime I tell her she hurt me, her response has almost always been to hurt me more. It seems to me that me telling her that she hurt me, shatters her image of herself as the most perfect person ever, so she gets excessively defensive and proceeds to protect herself by putting me down.The other day I also asked her over the last 2 years, she has never apologized a single time or owned any fault in any of our quarrels. I asked if she thinks there is any fault of hers behind any quarrel for the last 2 years? She thought about it then said her only two faults are allowing me to fall in love with her, as well as thinking too highly of me when we got together. Otherwise, every quarrel is completely my fault. I was honestly quite stunned by her response.Another thing she does is she loves to yell over me, insult me, then suddenly disappear or block me in any disagreement. I think it is a childish way for her to get the last word in and to frustrate me as then I have no way to respond. She will then proceed to have fun for hours or days while I feel anxious and stressed. She will then abruptly reappear at some point, write insulting or hurtful words to me, or call me to say these, then block me again before I can even respond. This cycle then repeats for a few rounds until she has had her fill.What makes me even more upset is she will always make me out to be the bad person. She will also lie and twist reality to support her version of what happened. She will then badmouth me to her friends then come back to me and tell me how ""everyone"" supports her. The interesting thing is she is a very popular person, with a very happy and outgoing public image. I often cannot reconcile how she can be such a monster behind closed doors. This also means that if I say out, no one will believe me also.Breakup is easy, can just walk away, so I am hoping not to have to do that unless really no choice. Is there any hope of reforming a girlfriend like her? 2 years is a lot to throw away.-#97476: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97476","['Like: 48 people', 'Sad: 34 people', 'Care: 11 people']",152 Comments,21 Shares

97471,"I met my bf some time last year. Things are going pretty smoothly for us, both of us are pretty busy with our work schedules on a daily basis.Now we are just two very busy adults working non stop, things can get so busy with either of us that we can even not see each other for two weeks.His family is really nice and I really love his family. They are so loving and would invite me over for dinners. I have to admit I am at fault for being unable to attend the dinner sometimes due to my busy schedule.He would also meet his friends just for some casual drinks, almost every other day.His parents did mention to me that he had been drinking till late, and that they are worried about him drinking and smoking. They tried to hint me trying to make him quit smoking, but it’s not that easy given the fact that all his friends smokes. I’m not one who would control what he wants to do. I believe that he is old enough to know what is he doing. I mean he’s already an adult, no longer a juvenile. Just at times, I don’t know how to actually react to his parents “requests”. I understand his parents’ POV and “request” meant no harm as they just wanted him to be healthy too. They too, did remind me not to push him too hard if I were to ask him to quit smoking or drink lesser. They just don’t know how they can “remind him” anymore because if they do, they some how turns it into a nagging session and it kinda pisses him off. Till now I have yet to speak to him with regards to his parents “request”. I’m just afraid that things might turn not so nice between them as he is slowly getting a bit nicer to his family now as compared to before.-#97471: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97471",['Like: 5 people'],6 Comments,0 Shares
97470,"Are men still expected to pay for all the food and dates? It's not a big deal deal to me (22), I'm just curious what everyone thinks. Both my mom and dad asked me recently if my boyfriend (23) treats me food or if we pay for our own food. My mom thinks boyfriends should always pay for girlfriends and my dad thinks my boyfriend is too calculative. They both have a very traditional idea of courtship but ironically (or not) they are divorced. I didn't feel like lying to them so I just said that we take turns to pay, and tried to defend him by saying that he's still studying, like I am, and not earning any money yet. Chivalry sounds nice and all because who wouldn't want to be spoiled with gifts and free food? I wouldn't expect it because obviously times have changed but I feel bad that my parents are stuck in this idea and seem to not have the best impression of my boyfriend. Especially because he's quite introverted he doesn't usually make extra efforts to reach out to my family and my friends, so my friends and family always question our relationship. They don't challenge it outright and I've told my boyfriend about it whenever it happens as well....he doesn't seem to care...but it's not ideal because I obviously would like the people I care about to get along well (especially with my family, I wish I could be closer with them but these things make it hard).

97469,"Dear #96224, After reading your confession, I truly thought for a second that I was the one writing that.. My ex was exactly the same as your boyfriend. When we were together we met around once a week or slightly less. We lived really far from one another and he preferred to study alone. Although I did mention a couple of times he can come over to study if he wants, he would always say that he dont want and can only study at home. Because of his heavy school load, we would not have much time left for each other. Especially towards mid-terms period aand towards finals, sometimes we would only meet once a month and honestly I was ok with it as he was busy. I have told him many times that I prefer we met up more and we do not have to go out for fun dates (for long hours) we can just meet up occasionally for lunch or study dates in between our busy schedule.. or we can even just facetime each other.. but it never happened. Afterwards, he started a new business venture that took up even more of his time. We broke up as I could see that I am no way his priority and he said that going out with me has become more of a burden after a while. He claimed that he still loved me and I will still be his best friend no matter what. And let me tell you this, its all bullsht. We still follow each other on instagram as we are still friends. He has been going out a lot to study and just doing things he claimed he didnt prefer doing when he was with me. Aside from this issue of not spending enough time with me, there were other minor issues which would have amounted to gigantic redflags added together. But what made me waited so long before ending it was because even now after breaking up for almost one year, I still love him.To all the ladies out there, love yourself first. If the man does not treat you with respect and treats you well, learn to let go early. After breaking up, I thought, should I have compromised or maybe should I have been more understanding? If he has valid reasons for doing what he did, should I have waited for him to be less busy?

The last straw was she made a big deal in a group chat of other people on how 1) I didn’t submit something she requested by deadline(she sent me a lot of things 2) I did submit but I couldn’t access the link so I sent via email 3) she got a bitch fit and criticise me in the group chat that consist of few people including a store manager who reports to me. She said that I shouldn’t make her go into the file in and out for that 2-3 mins. I feel that she’s rude, domineering, micromanaging and just unrealistic. She kicked up a big fuss when she needed something from me but she took days to reply an email from me.My best friend advised me not to leave but to face her. I think it’s because she’s one of the most senior, most of the things get slided over.

We didn’t have a chance to talk to each other as M is in another department while I am in human resource department. The first time we had a proper conversation was when one of my co-workers from the same department asked me to join them at the smoking area. We were both introduced to each other formally for the first time and subsequently we have been smoking together with the others. M would always say nice comments on the outfits I wear to work or the way I style my hair, buying me drinks or treating me to me lunch but I always politely decline. At the start I felt uncomfortable, but he is married so I thought he treats me like his own daughter as he is twice my age.

After I return back to office, one of my colleague told me and said that M kept asking about my whereabouts and looked very sad throughout the week when I was not in office, and they conclude that it is because of me. I just brushed it off, telling them it is just coincidence as he is married and wouldn’t have interest in me. So fast forward, M asked me out for drinks 2 days ago during the weekend and said that the other colleagues are joining too, so I accepted the invite and went to drink with them. But turns out when I reach the bar, he already started drinking and said that the others are not coming as they have plans last minute. I wanted to leave as I don’t feel comfortable drinking or spending time alone with him, so I went out of the bar, but he chased after me and confessed to me and said he really like me. He was high from all those drinks and even placed his hands around my waist. I struggled to break free but he went ahead to kiss me on my lips. I was shocked and pushed him away and ran home. I ran home and cried, and went to tell my supervisor that I want to leave the company with immediate effect.

97460,"Gonna be long, TLDR: Looking for advice on pursuing a private Data Science or Business Analytics degree because my GPA is trash (2.2), and I really am a blur fuck.First off, I have a bad GPA because a lot of unfortunate and unforeseen events happened in my personal life that have caused me to be unstable during my polytechnic years, and that resulted in my abysmal GPA, having to retake multiple modules because I can't focus on my studies (but also because I'm blur) but more on that later. I accept full responsibility for my poor performance and would like to carve a better future for myself by taking a degree.Personally, my interests lie in Data Science. To sum it up, I like the way it is so logical, and so rational. Data is literally an abstraction of reality and that I can see myself organizing and managing data structures yadayada, Also, someone with a Data Science degree can perform the roles of a Business Analyst and not the other way around, so I thought it'd be pretty good to study Data Science, so my knowledge would be deeper and my scope would be wider.However, here are the cruxes,Data Science is heavy on CS and I can't help but think that Professor Ben said that one's performance in CS is very dependent on their aptitude, and that has been holding me back a lot on whether I should pursue Data Science or Business Analytics as the former is more CS intensive, whereas the latter has a bit of Data Science and Business, which I am also fairly interested in. Given my horrible 2.4 GPA from poly, I am afraid that even passing the the degree would be unnecessarily strenuous and that I would always be constantly behind my classmates.Furthermore, I read that many Data Scientists often hold a masters degree, and unless I do so in a field already full of superhigh IQ peeps, I'll always be lagging behind the restPerhaps, I was thinking, take a Business Analytics degree, then take Data Science courses externally? I wish I could end things here, but I cannot.To make things worse, I am also insanely careless. I suspect I might have ADHD, idk. All along as I'm studying, I am often losing a solid 20-30% of my marks in my Math and Sciences because of stupid mistakes (wrote a + instead of a - or read the question wrongly, like 3 times??? ) It's ridiculous and I don't understand how I'm plagued with this. Even irl I am slightly dysfunctional, I keep dropping my phone, and I've been told I'm a type A neat freak, which makes it worse because even if my things are so neat and my belongings are in plain sight, I simply MISS IT COMPLETELY.

97458,"Serious post. Anybody with experience lodging a complain to CASE under the consumer fair protection act?Recently I bought a second hand bike from a bike shop(it wasn't cheap). The bike shop owner/mechanic said that he ran all diagnostic checks and there were no problems. I rode it around the compound, no major issues so I bought it. But it gave me some issues immediately after I bought it, so I sent it to a workshop near my house and what I thought was a minor problem turned out to be a whole bucket list of problems. Basically this bike mechanic did not tell me what he should have been able to find out through his 'diagnostic tests'. Either he found out and didn't tell me, or he didn't even check it, or he was incompetent. Asked around and apparently a number of other motorists have bad experience with this mechanic. One guy's bike was destroyed after this mechanic failed to tighten a nut in the engine.(nut came loose and destroyed everything in its path when the engine was running). It was obviously his fault but he refused to own up. Unfortunately I don't have his statements on black and white. I was wondering if such a complaint would be successful with CASE? Or what can they do for me, and what else can I provide for then to  solve this problem for me effectively? In short, does anybody know what I can do next? Thanks in advance. Much appreciated.-#97458: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97458","['Like: 4 people', 'Care: 1 person']",9 Comments,0 Shares
97452,"We’ve been dating for more than a month now. He has been very caring, nice and attentive to the little details and we both are excited to see each other every time.One thing I’m unsure of is our differences because we don’t have much in common to talk about. He’s in law and I’m in business. I’m an indoor person and he belongs to the outdoors. He’s sociable and makes friends easily but I prefer building relationships with people I know from school. He’s into English upbeat songs and I prefer Korean love songs. He’s a foodie but I’m not picky about food.We spent our last few dates flirting and being touchy. We take turns making dirty puns and jokes and sometimes he drops subtle hints about sex. I don’t feel uncomfortable with those and in fact I get turned on and will laugh along. But I feel that this is progressing too quickly and I want to know him more before we move to the next stage. What should I do?

97450,"Dilemma here. Need advice.I was offered Wharton/UPenn, and as of May 1st, I accepted the offer. I was also offered SMU.Thing is, I will receive zero funding from Penn, while SMU is a full-ride for me. My dad's business was very badly hit by the coronavirus and he has assured me that he will be able to fund my Wharton degree even though I know for a fact that he will struggle. SMU would probably be the most sensible choice for me, but my dad desperately wants me to go to Wharton. I think the money he would spend on my degree would be far better utilised if capitalised in our business. Since his plan for me is to take over his business, I honestly don't see how much value a Wharton degree would add to my career. His rationale for going to Wharton is I will get a much a better education in terms of living independently, rubbing shoulders with students who were raised in highly successful families, and experiencing a foreign country. More crucially, he wants me to dilute my excessive ""Singaporean-ness"" with regards to army-style rule-following, risk aversion, and being penny-wise and pound-foolish, traits he collectively coins ""HDB mentality."" He explained that all of this will help me run a business much more competently.I am open to going to Wharton, I just want to do it for logical reasons. My dad is a lot older and has experience running a highly successful business. I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt that his reasons have merit. I have no way of knowing otherwise. Would also like to reiterate that I think SMU is the right choice.

97439,"I could not find any answers online so here goes.My daughter is too sensitive and mature. She is 10. We have a happy family. My husband and I are happily tgt. A few times when she told me she made plans with her friend (our neighbour) and I commented that I planned a family dinner, she would immediately cancel on her friend.Once she was on her way back from tuition (just across the street from our house), she texted me to say she saw some nice and cheap t shirts and asked me if I wanted. I said OK if they are cheap. I didnt know by the time I replied she already reached home! She went back across the street to buy. On the surface it looks nice to have such a great child but I have learnt that she listens so much to the point where she will sacrifice herself for others. Now I'm at a point where I have to think twice before I say anything. It's kind of tiring tbh. I'm not sure how many parents out there have children like this. My biggest fear is that I will unknowingly hurt or influence my child's decision somehow somewhere bcus she listens/cares too much. I don't want her to cancel plans with her friends just bcus of me. Idw to be the reason she doesn't have a childhood. Do any of you understand this situation? It's really more tiring than raising a immature child. You have to be so careful at every step. I have to specifically makes comments like  ""don't go if you are alrdy at home."" or ""Mummy can handle this alone."". Otherwise she will feel obligated to tag along. She feels that it is her responsibility to tag along. Once I told her I'm not cooking anymore and told her to go with her friends just so that she will go. I think even this hurt her. I could tell from her facial expression. Once in a while, she would use some of her saving to buy sweets for her friends. Tbh I don't like her doing this. Once is OK but... I told her she should spend the money on herself. I'm saying this partly bcus I know her friends won't reciprocate. I'm not saying we do things only to get sth back. Aiya Yall adults know what I'm saying lah. Idw her to become a laughing stock or sth. I'm sure yall have met people who give too much and they themselves end up don't get any help bcus most ppl don't care. I have been trying to teach her to protect her own interest. It is okay to give but we need to grasp the right amount. Once she gave all her biscuits away and lied that she still had some more in her bag. Good thing she has a good friend who knows her well enough. I asked her why she lied. She said she lied because she knew if she said she had no biscuits then her friends would have to give up theirs to give to her. It hurts me bcus the truth is most people don't care. Most people won't bother to ask if you have any biscuits. Just bcus they asked doesn't mean they care. Yall know what I mean. They asked just to ask. Even if you said you have no biscuits how many will share?? Do yall understand my frustration?? Those biscuits belong to her to begin with. She bought them using her own money. She was once accidentally locked in the classroom by the class monitress. She went to hide herself and rejoined the class when they were back from morning assembly like nth happened. I asked her why. She said if she made a fuss, the classmate would get scolded. Once she fell sick during some CIP. She refused to say anything until her good friend told the teacher. I asked her why she didn't voice earlier. She said bcus she wasn't done with her part yet and if she left her classmates would need to do more. I told her she should stop because of herself.

We are in different departments but our respective departments have to be in close coordination in order for the co to function well.She is a friendly, outgoing and nice girl. She's 27/28 while I am 24. We would always get to see each other in the main hq until somewhere late last year, she was redeployed to one of the co's branch. We are on very good terms and she would always offer me tips and advice how to adjust and motivate me to do well. We would sometimes stop for a short chat and joke with each other. I must admit, I am attracted to her but I have been suppressing my feelings for her. She mentioned she has a boyfriend and from the picture she uses as her W.A. profile pic, I can tell he is a good person. I am now stuck, should I let her know my feelings for her or should I suppress it for life until the day I die?

97422,"I'm a girl studying law and I have a boyfriend in business. Our relationship has been going really well, but recently my boyfriend has started acting rather strangely. Whenever we meet new people and someone asks me what course I'm doing, before I have a chance to answer he blurts out 'FASS' and then changes the subject. I don't correct him because I don't want to embarrass him in front of other people, and when I ask him about it in private he keeps saying that he just gets FASS confused with Law because 'they sound similar'. I asked him if it was because FASS is lower than his course on the IGPs, but he says that's just a coincidence. Also, I can't watch Netflix with him anymore because he keeps trying to spoil every episode while we're watching it. I've asked him to stop but he insists that they can't be spoilers because he hasn't seen the show, he just has psychic powers. When I pointed out that Iron Man was unlikely to make an appearance in Bridgerton, he made some unintelligible screeching noises and left the room in tears. Another time I woke up to find him standing over me with bags under his eyes. As soon as he noticed I was awake he announced that he knew 'all eight digits of pi' and smugly rattled them off. I waited for him to finish before telling him that I didn't think the third digit was a 6, and a quick google search confirmed that he had spent the early hours of the morning memorising what appeared to be the telephone number for a massage palour at Parklane Shopping Centre. I love him but I don't know how much more of this I can take. I would appreciate if anyone who has been in a similar situation could give me some advice on how to make him feel less insecure about his intelligence?

For a basic reno, we have been quoted from 30-50k. We have also approached a few interior designers and their packages ranges from 100-150k. We are particularly impressed by the offering from one interior designer. They are famous in this field and promised a luxurious experience after the reno is completed. They showed us many projects they have completed and the final product is just comparable to a luxury hotel. They would use premium materials and many of the furnishings are imported overseas. The price quoted to us is about 130k inclusive of all furnishing but excluding any electrical items. If we were to go for this, we would empty out any remaining savings we have and need to take an additional reno loan of 80k. Both of us came from humble backgrounds and particularly for me, have lived in a cramped and messy 3 room hdb in the past and really want to experience the luxury living.

Either way ppl are gonna say something - so if you are so affected by others that it causes a strain on your relationship, just do her a favor, breakup and find a business gf.

97404,"Is it impossible to accumulate $100 mil unless you go into business?I'm graduating next year and it seems the ""standard"" approach to life is to get a good job, and then work a salary your whole life. I ran the numbers recently and it seems like it is impossible for anyone to become rich this way. Even if you started out with a salary of $400K, which is typical for a partner at a Big 4 accounting firm, over a 30-year career, you would only have earned $12 mil gross. Realistically, it would take more than 15 years to make partner at a Big 4. In the same period, property prices would have doubled 3 times, assuming the adage is true that property prices doubles every 10 years. Even if it only doubles over a 30-year period (very unlikely), a 10,000 sq ft landed property in a prime district like Bukit Timah, which already costs $15 mil now, would be worth $30 mil. $12 mil isn't even half. So, even if you climbed to the top of the corporate ladder, which has a lower probability than being hit by a car, it is unlikely that one would be able to join the GCB-class in Singapore.I'm not saying being middle-class isn't already a good life, and I'm not saying money is everything in life, but it seems that if one were to aspire to own their own landed property in Singapore, the property ladder is already too high to climb for anyone starting out now. I don't even know if I'd be able to afford a condo of the same size as the 3-bedroom HDB flat I grew up in. But even in business, you use to be able to earn very good returns on simple businesses, such as running a chicken rice stall, or a corner shop selling sundries. Nowadays, the margins are so thin that it makes more sense to work a salary. The future seems really bleak for anyone born after the 90s to become really wealthy. I don't want to be an alarmist, but it seems really unfair to people like me, having not much to leverage from their parents, to become wealthy over a single generation. I envy my peers who are taking over their parents businesses, instead of having to slog it out in the workforce, when wage growth is clearly going to be outpaced dramatically by land prices and cost of living.-#97404: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97404","['Like: 43 people', 'Sad: 10 people', 'Haha: 9 people']",66 Comments,23 Shares
97401,"Hi, SoC alumni here. Seeing the posts about folks looking for internships and jobs, I want to showcase an alternative career path: do a startup. Make a unicorn. Whether you succeed or not, you would be enjoying each day.The general perception is that the chances of success are remote and it is a lot of hard work. Yes, both a true but they do not tell the full story.For one, you won’t be working harder than employees necessarily. I do not see how my work hours will change if I take a job. But what will change is that you will be more motivated if this is your company. And it is easier to then see the upside of grunt work.Also, it is a myth that raising money is hard. I am an average student and I did not even have a deck when raising the first round. You don’t need everyone to believe in your vision, you just need a few angels. And if you believe in the idea enough to spend all your time on it, why would others not? And Singapore is full of early stage investors. It is really a good place to start a company.In a job, you are expected to figure things out. In a startup, your investors will help you do that. You can hire people who know more to help you with whatever you do not know. A startup with a vision to be a unicorn is the only work environment where so many people want to do their best to help you succeed for their own good. I just pick up the phone when I cannot get a sale to close or when the website is taking too long to be built, and investors or advisors suggest ideas. All you then need to do is implement them and ask for help again. Unlike a job, asking for help is a virtue.You will never have a mid life crisis because you will be working om something that changes the world. There would always be purpose and a vision.You decide your timings, you decide the policies etc.. For example, we do work from home because I like sleeping late and starting the day right after I wake up at around 10am. I just need to fetch my computer to start work.And what is failure in a startup? You don’t get enough traction? You can sell the company any time, you will still have created value and you will already be ready to do your second startup after 2 years. It will be easy to do everything the 2nd time around because you are experienced.Finally, this is the only way to change your life radically. A well paying job might net you 250K in savings a year. But will that change your lifestyle? No. And you will likely be spending hours doing tasks you do not completely believe in. A good exit in a startup means your lifestyle will actually change.Boys and girls, consider chasing the unicorn dream. This is the best time in human history to do it. Everyone will support you. NUS Enterprise, private investors, customers, etc. etc.. And you will be changing the world in some meaningful way too if you succeed, how cool is that?-#97401: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97401","['Like: 16 people', 'Haha: 1 person', 'Wow: 1 person']",10 Comments,2 Shares
97399,"Hi all, in urgent need of constructive advice. I met this guy from my hall in year 1 and have known him for 3 years. He's studying history, which I found really intriguing and attractive when he shares knowledge about the past, etc when we study together. We both bicker with each other a lot at first (even in front of hall mates) but we got closer overtime as we share many similar values. He confessed to me during midterms and I thought I'd give it a try. However, the sudden swap from friends to couple made me realise that I'm not at all physically attracted to him.. I can't stand it when his body odour becomes apparent/doesn't trim his hair/ wears unflattering clothes/etc.. This made me really guilty as I don't want to change him yet I truly can't seem to see past this. I am emotionally attracted to him though. He is seriously the sweetest and most amazing, thoughtful guy/pursuer I've ever had. He always put me first, and has a heart of gold for others which I admire a lot. Many of my friends/hall mates/even my father tbro think well of him.We always have lots of fun togetheraswell.What should I do..? Should I give it more time? I thought of confiding in him but I'm afraid to hurt his feelings... Yet I don't want to waste his time if I'm so uncertain to move on.

97388,"#97298 Hi, I am the OP of #97298. The previous post was my first time posting to here therefore I do not know I need to paragraph by enter, I am sorry for anyone who have trouble viewing. I had read every comments, whether those that ask me to leave him or stick with him, or said that I am too clingy etc. I appreciated every comments, I previously also read about what PhD studies are all about and decided to post here so I could gain more insights of his PhD life, he rarely told me that he is stressed, but I know all along that he is. I am currently a frontliner working in a hospital, and during my free time I do photography, dancing and study Japanese, other than that I did have my own group of friends, and I hang out with them from time to time. Everyone often ask me, “Do you have time for your BF?” I always smiled and said, “He was the one who doesn’t have time for me.” I admit that I am emotionally attached to him, and I miss him sometimes so I really need to see him physically, not in video call, especially when we are both in Singapore, but he said that he was too busy and sometimes stop me from going over to his place, when he said he got “no mood” to see me, it really crushed me. I am willing to go over to his place at his convenience just to see him. I just don’t understand why he could not give me the time. And usually when we are spending time together, he is reading his study material and I am reading my Japanese class material, I don’t mind if he didn’t talk to me at that time at all. I just want him to be with me for some time. I already talked to him regarding this for a few times but it didn’t really wake him up until I told him I want to break up. Probably it’s the best that we part ways and hopefully he can find someone better or he can finally put his focus on study.-#97388: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97388","['Like: 9 people', 'Care: 3 people']",7 Comments,1 Share
97387,"I have been seeing this guy for almost 2 months after first meeting him on a dating app. He's super cute and charismatic and is doing pretty well in his startup career while attending uni in nus. However, after every dinner date, he would propose to chill at his place, quoting that there was no one at home and he's lonely. I rejected it almost every time but the following day he would proceed to send this long wall of text to guilt trip me, saying that im not considerate to his feelings enough and that it is unfair for him. I've told him before that im not comfortable with progressing into physical intimacy so soon and would like to take some time to know him more but he would always refute and say sth like i can only get to know him better by going over. This has gone on for over a month and recently, he bluntly mentioned that if i cannot be there to satisfy his sexual needs im not the one for him.

97386,"This guy and I have been seeing each other for 9 months and we're both in uni. This rs in particular is different to the two relationships I've had in the past where there's actually space between us, so there was a bit of an adjustment period on my part with regards to my abandonment issue, I can confidently say I'm doing a good job managing it though. I didn't bring it up to him because I knew it was a personal issue, and I knew it was something to deal with myself. I knew it was something I had to look inwards for. What I did bring up, however, was that I felt unappreciated and felt that he had no time for me, our conversation was literally only good morning and goodnight, he doesn't ask how I am etc., and I told him that mattered to me, that expressing your love towards someone isn't a grand gesture, but lies in the small actions you do. I told him several times, but although he apologized several times, there was no change in his behavior. I just do my best to understand him, I don't have control over what he does/thinks, but I have control over how I choose to make of things, how I choose to perceive or think of things as. I don't think it's anything personal. I mean, when you get too swamped with studies, you just drown, right? I mean, that's not the case for myself as I always ask him how he is etc even if I'm swamped in studies too, but that doesn't mean it's the same for everyone. He had time to play an hp game with his friends after class, staying up until past midnight - 4 AM, but not enough time to message me, okay, he's probably destressing from studies. There are times when I'm the same, and then when he messages me, it's just a goodnight. Okay, I suppose he's tired. I'd be tired too. It got to a point where I broke down and begged him to at least listen to me, reply to me, or hear me out because I felt like I wasn't being listened to or appreciated or anything. He just ignored me and was watching a movie, and that really hurt me. He told me he wasn't in the mood. Okay, I understand, I wish he'd told me earlier. The next day, he told me he was going through something and I understood, but he still didn't bother to reassure me and continued to ignore my concerns. He told me what specifically what he was going through, and I understood and comforted him and everything, with my concerns not having been brought up since. I guess it's something I'd have to deal with myself, right? I can give that reassurance to myself, I can choose what to think of how I perceive things, but honestly, it hurts a lot. I tried to bring up my concerns again a few times more, but I just get ignored or he tells me he's busy, okay, I understand. Whenever I asked him when it could be talked about, I just got ignored, and I told him that I want him to at least tell me when it could be talked about, but there was nothing again. I just understood him. He must not have the emotional capacity to because of how stressed he is. Okay, I'll do my best to be a supportive and understanding partner. I'll deal with it myself. Honestly, I feel like he has broken my trust in him.. He apologized so many times only for nothing to change. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells being around him, I can't explain it, but sometimes, I think ""is it okay for me to open up to him? Is he in a good mood? Is now a good time to open up to him?"" I know the last question is a good question to think as it's important to be mindful of other people too, not only of yourself, but I don't know if I'm able or I'd be able to open up to him again, the few times I did it, I was just pushed away. Sure, I understand, he had his reasons, but I don't know, it just hurt, and I'm scared of opening up only for the same thing to happen again. I feel like bringing up anything to him doesnt do anything either, since there's no change despite how many times I already brought stuff up. So what I do is just to look inwards. I just work on myself. I just do my best to reframe how I think about stuff. After all, I'm the only one I have control over. No point stressing over what I don't have control over, right? Might as well just accept it.Meanwhile, whenever he's down, even if I'm busy, I comfort him immediately/reassure him/listen to him/anything. When I get those uncomfortable feelings anytime at all lately, I deal with it myself. I don't bother bringing it up to him anymore. It's a me problem anyway. I just journal out whatever thoughts or feelings I have in mind and they go away. I think I'm doing great actually, I like that I don't seek reassurance from him anymore, and that I give it to myself.However, I want to ask, is this normal? Oftentimes, I think about what if I feel an uncomfortable feeling again in the future? I know he is not responsible for my feelings though, but what if it's about me feeling unappreciated etc again? Can I open up to him? I honestly cannot answer that question. I don't know if I can. I think I will just get pushed aside like nothing again, and I think it'd be better for me to not rely on him. I can rely on myself instead; however, I can't help but have a thought at the back of my mind:Is this how a relationship should be? Yes, you're not supposed to lose yourself in a relationship, there's still supposed to be space between the two of you; however, aren't you supposed to at least be there for each other, listen to each other's woes or anything? I know I've been doing that for him to this day without a doubt, but am I robbing him of his chances, ""ruining"" what we have over being scared of opening up to him considering his track record? Am I being too overbearing? Am I being too clingy for wanting time with him, for wanting him to listen to me, to feel appreciated even though he's busy? But I've been doing those things (time, listening to him, comforting him, reassuring him, making him feel loved and cared for etc) for him  I'm so confused  I don't understand myself and I don't understand if what I'm doing is right.. I know I have control over if I stay or leave, and I choose to stay, but there's those nagging thoughts at the back of my head..  I just want to give my best and do my best so I don't have regrets, I give it my all, but it hurts a lot, but even so, I just understand him and reframe my thinking into how I have control over how I perceive things, it's probably nothing personal..-#97386: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97386","['Like: 6 people', 'Care: 5 people', 'Sad: 4 people']",9 Comments,3 Shares
97382,"Prior to 2020, being a cabin crew was very sought after. But not many people know that actually there are a lot of foreign crews in Singapore Airline. I didn't know I have such a nationalistic sentiments prior to joining the airline. Out of my batch of 20, only 1/4 were Singaporeans. I felt like I was in a foreign land when I was in class. Majority of them are very nice people but a few of them did make unnecessary remarks while I was there. I remembered that there was one Malaysian trainee who announced to the whole class that she was only using Singapore as a stepping stone, so she can live and work in Europe next time. Fast forward many years, she is now married with kids in Singapore to a local. I guess Singapore has something better to offer to her than Europe after all. My trainer back then was a Malaysian born. She prefers Malaysian because she felt that they were more committed to the airline and had stayed longer. I felt that she could have kept the comment to herself even if the comment might be true base on her observation. The company rationale for hiring foreigners are such that there will be a local speaking crew in every flight. So if the plane is flying to Japan, there should be a Japanese speaking crew. So hiring of foreigners are not due to being anti-Singaporeans but there is a real business need. But I really wonder how many % of the crews are foreigners. And for promotion, would nationality be an important criteria for consideration? And if there are more foreigners being promoted, and people tends to be bias to people of their own nationality, would the culture be more favourable to foreigners in the long run.-#97382: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97382",['Like: 37 people'],17 Comments,7 Shares

I have been very understanding and patient with him especially when he is in NS now. We hardly have time to talk because he is always tired (he is in ST) whenever he dismount too. He would take naps during his breaks and we hardly even have a 10 min conversation daily. Sometimes when he is upset, he would cancel our plans and make plans with his friends instead. He will also game whenever he is out with his friends and hardly makes time for me.

I am a sensitive person and may overthink like maybe two weeks of less conversation as compared to usual long chats, I would wonder is it his interest is fading. He assured me on the times I would prompt him my doubts (like twice), that he is still interested and how busy his work is. What surprises me is, during an occasion when I didn't display my doubts, he still assures me. I am quite interested in him because I realize that during the day whenever I came across something interesting, sad or happy I would want to send him, but of course at times I will hold back because I do not want to disturb his busy work.

97372,"Hi all(kind souls on the net), need some help with insurance matters.My mom went for a type of heart surgery(balloon angioplasty) some time back and I just found out that her insurance company denied the hospital claims saying that she has got heart disease before. But the thing is she never had any Doctors told her she’s got any heart diseases before the surgery took place? It’s the first time anyone even told her she has got heart disease before and it’s the insurance agent. The Insurance Agent said she went to check with the hospital for my mom’s health records and told her that her hospital claim for the surgery was not possible because of her prior health records. Only simple verbal conversations to tell her it’s a no-go and the case is done. How is this allowed and possible? My mom herself went to the hospital to dig for her records too to want to find out more but was only given some charts that only Doctors can read and understand. There are no written reports to state if she have had any heart related diseases before. Now she has to pay for the full amount of hospital fees despite being insured with relevant insurance policies. So she’s been paying all these years to the insurance company for nothing? I’m ready to call up/visit the hospital to ask for more reports for proof. Please let me know what I can do to help her. She’s very stressed out but did not want to burden me that’s why I only just found out about this by accident.

I might have feelings for him cos I feel like we click well tgt and have been thinking about him almost everyday. He's 3 years younger than me and I don't even see him everyday. I saw the comments, telling me to give M a try because age shouldn't matter as feelings would matter more. I thought about the whole situation logically and I do realized that the age doesn't matter anymore but when I weigh out the pros and cons of chasing him, more cons appeared I realized he might just be flirting with me cos I'm someone new in the team and now that time has past, we are getting further and further away. The both of us are at different stages in life (I'm a fresh grad while he is still in studying in ite) and dating would seem hard at this point. Although it's possible to text him everyday, but I don't think it would work out in a long run if our feelings are not mutual. Plus, I don't think I'm pretty enough or even good enough for him...My friends mentioned that this would just be an affection and I would get over it soon but it's alot harder than I thought......

I missed that target 2 years ago, and I missed it by a mile.

97333,"My bf is currently a Y1 uni student. During his 1st semester, we had a huge argument as he was talking to and studying with an attached girl. It may sound normal, but they are messaging almost everyday till late night 4 - 5am. He did told me that she's attached, and they are just friends. But I had read their chat and he was saying hurtful and disrespectful things about me to her (even though he knows I dislike her already). Because of it, we had a huge argument. And he compromised, by not studying or talking to the attached girl anymore. Recently I had a talk with my bf, regarding him befriending females in school. He understands that I am an insecure person, and I overthink a lot. I told him that I am uncomfortable with him befriending so many females in school. He reassured me that he is just making friends, nothing more than that. However, I found out that he have been talking to them via Telegram and even sending cute stickers. And usually it is him who started the conversation. This made me think of the attached girl situation again, and we kept arguing about it. Till the point that he told me he felt restricted by me... However, I don't feel that it is wrong to have my bf comply to keep a distance from his new female friends. Instead, it should be an unspoken rule for all attached individuals right? It is okay to be friends, but not so close... Am I being restricting...? Please advice me on this...-#97333: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97333","['Like: 56 people', 'Haha: 11 people', 'Angry: 6 people']",71 Comments,29 Shares

97332,"Tldr- should I reject a guy who looks significantly different from his pics on a dating app?Recently I got matched to this guy on a dating app. A big part on why I swiped him is that he has that k drama star look. We chatted via whatsapp for about a week and found that we click pretty well. He soon asked me out and we will be meeting for dinner in a few day’s time. The problem is this, I just found out by chance about his very recent pics from other sources. Tbh, I was surprised and disappointed at the same time about how he looked. We exchanged ig and I saw that his dating app pics were taken 2-3 years back. His ig has not been updated regularly since then and most of his pics were of scenery and group pics where his face is too small to be seen. While he looked cute and vibrant back then, his face has become much rounder, his hair has thinned and he aged quite a fair bit. He’s a high achiever at work and I think it might be his job stresses that cause him to age but still I’m really disappointed. If he has used his current pics, I’d have passed him over srsly. At this stage, should I ghost him straight? Or should I go for the dinner and see, then decide if to ghost him afterwards?-#97332: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97332","['Haha: 43 people', 'Like: 29 people']",80 Comments,7 Shares

Whilst my family has been very supportive and has advised me constantly on how marriage is and the values needed to sustain a formidable and sustainable marriage, my partner's family have created many issues for her. I am decently established in my career, working towards a trajectory of growth and my family has been nothing but forthcoming to my fiancée and her family. I have been long trying to find some level of acceptance with her family but it has been very challenging and disrespectful on their end. Even discussions about a banquet or customs become hostile towards me and especially towards my parents. I love her a lot and she has been through enough with her own family as it is. All I want to do is work on giving her a better life but a part of me sinks that I will never gain acceptance from my in laws and the other part of me is broken that my parents had to go through such levels of disrespect. My partner has affirmed me that we will not look back once we sign that dotted line and we have promised each other to continue watering our plant of marriage to attain bliss and happiness.But a part of me needs healing and I'd appreciate some advice on how I can heal better from all the hurt, berating, insult and demeaning and close that chapter.

97317,"Admins plz plz do not filter...I’m asking for advice. Long story short there is this girl that I’m friends with and used to have feelings for, but she’s attached now to someone else. I’m happy to just stay in the sidelines and continue to be that good friend to her. But one thing that’s been bugging me is that I became more and more aware that her boyfriend is not exactly what he seems over time. It’s not like he committed any grave acts, but it’s multiple small things that I find questionable - just a few egs. 1. My friend is devout in her religion and only wants a bf that truly believes in the same. Although he tells her he believes, and accompanies her to her gatherings all the time, there are just signs that he doesn’t truly believe that myself and a select few others have noticed. 2. My friend feels strongly against porn. Her bf watches porn all the time but she is not aware as he keeps quiet about it. His mentality is what she doesn’t know wouldn’t hurt her?? 3. One of my friends knows his ex gf, and whilst he doesnt show it obviously, he is quite money minded, based on what was told to me at the very least. One of the reasons they (he and ex) broke up was because he couldn’t see a comfortable future with her and constantly brings up comments about this every now and then about how she needs to work harder in uni since her family isn’t well off, which the ex couldn’t take any more - and concurrently, was confiding in her close friends about her issues with him (who were both male), and then broke up with him eventually. But he now cites that they’ve broken up because she was interested in one of her male close friend? This friend of mine comes from a wealthy family and I don’t want her to be made used of, even indirectly. I think the question I’ve got is, should I tell her these small things or not? What’s holding me back is I do not wish to ruin our long-standing friendship, and if she believes him instead of me, I’ll probably never see her again. Furthermore, I don’t want her to get the impression like I’m making these comments because i used to have feelings for her (which she knows) and that I am trying to ruin their relationship. I’ve thought about just leaving things be for quite a few months now but it’s starting to bother me more as they are potentially planning for a wedding early next year. I don’t want my friend to find out about all this after she gets married but at the same time I risk losing a friendship I really care about with her still potentially proceeding on and then finding out this crap is true later.

97313,"To OP #97251: I used to date someone who was the same as your girlfriend. This person I was dating was depressed and had suicidal thoughts. At first I was very supportive, did everything I could in my power to help him; constantly being there for him, driving all the way to his house to pick him up, bringing him out just so to lift up his mood and so much more. He did go for therapy. He was under medication but even then, he was constantly down, always had depressive & suicidal thoughts. Eventually, I decided enough was enough. I am not here to treat him to become better. I am not his therapist, I am his girlfriend. I had to take care of my own mental health as it was taking a huge toll on my health and so, I broke up with him. He threatened that he was going to commit suicide, called me names, kept pestering but I did not budge. If he had wanted to kill himself, he wouldn’t have threatened me. Anyway, after I left him, I finally felt a huge relief. I was so much happier, I worked on myself and became a much happier person.

Since then, I’ve always chewed with my mouth close and got super sensitive when people around me chew super loudly. Problem is that my parents chew super loudly and i have asked them nicely if they could chew with their mouth closed. My mom’s response is that “she is born like that, she is born in the year of rat so she eats like one. And also she have been eating like that since i was young, why should she change? Why i start to find her annoying?” And my dad’s response is that “he have been eating like that since young, nobody taught him to eat with his mouth closed”. It takes a mental toll on me as my skin crawls every time i eat with them and get goosebumps and feel really uncomfortable. To cope with it, i tried to plug ear piece to block out the sound of them chewing. That also caused me to not be able to hear them talk, which my mom gets mad at. How can i get some therapy or anything as i really cant deal with the sound of my parent’s constant chewing noise, its really loud and the lips smacking is just bad.

Initially when we got together, we would try to do all things together and spend times together. But recently because he needed to study for his exam so he stopped seeing me, and the only time we would talk is during the night time before we sleep, for only around 10 minutes. Usually if there’s nothing important, he wouldn’t message me during the day time also, I was told by him not to message him so often as it will distract him from studying. Recently things got worse when we fought over the phone, we patched things up after that, but within a week he broke my heart and told me that “I didn’t have the mood to see you now cause I really need the time to study.” But I merely need 10 mins of his time, and I am suggesting to go to his place instead of asking him to come over. I asked around my friends who got a bf/gf and they all said they would always make time for each other, and their frequency of meet up is at least once per week, while I didn’t even get to see him till his exam is over. And before that, our meeting is once every two week (after the honeymoon phase). I already told him that I don’t mind going to somewhere near him to meet him, and I only need 2 hours of his time per week and I still don’t understand why he can’t make time for me. I still like him very much but I couldn’t do this anyone, so I told him over the phone last night that we are not compatible for each other and we should break up, and I am sorry that I break up with him one month before his exam, and I hope he is not too emotional influenced by that. I initially wanted to break up with him after his exam, but few days ago he messaged me and told me that he wanted to get married with me, while I at that stage, is planning for a break up. So I decided that I should not drag it any longer. He said he still like me and didn’t want me to leave, and we will break up temporarily for now till his exam is over, and we could talk it out after that. I just didn’t know if my decision is correct? Should I break up completely or should I stick with him?

As a carefree person, i agreed to bto with him and we got a unit which requires a lease of agreement to be signed soon.I come from a very physically abusive family and while i am mostly cheerful and happy, the truth is, i have ptsd from the severe beatings and i do suffer from suspected high functioning depression (Dr's suspicion). My doctor cried when i told her what i went through and how i feel it affects me even in adulthood, and frankly, i felt quite pathetic and damaged. Certain Triggers will cause me to go into attack mode where i may lash out or be physically violent if cornered due to some traumatic experiences in the past. I spent a goood portion of my life trying to build everything back up and face my inner demons and for once, i feel as though, i managed to get a stable footing.My bf is from a happy stable family. Everytime we fight, i have told him multiple times (100x) to just give in to me, hong me and if need be discusd another time where i have cooled off. I also requested that he does not do my triggers that will cause me to feel frightened and act out.Yet he fails to. Recently, our fights have escalated to violent scuffles (he intimidates me, i act out when i feel threatened and he hits back violently). I recognise that this is not a healthy relationship anymore. Despite multiple talks on changes during fights, ie. I wanted him to be the bigger man and just give in when i am mad, so that things would not escalate, and talk about it when i have cooled off. I wanted him to stop saying paggro and hurtful stuff during fights. I wanted him to be understanding that not every fight, he has to make a point to me, even as i am there crying and pleading. I wanted him to keep promises to me and not be physically violent to me (even if i act out). He would kick chairs and tables when we argue because he is angry.He couldn't. He kept doing the same things that puts me in uncomfortable, hurt and painful positions. Other than this, he is perfectly ok and spoils me.I am at a loss as the bto payment date is upcoming. I have recognised that he is likely not the guy that can love and respect me (with all my baggages and pain) and probably is not emphathetic enough to my trauma. He doesn't want to cancel the house and wants to try and continue (tbh, he keeps changing his mind and im unsure what he really wants). He has called in to postpose the date to give us a longer runway. He has called into counselling hotlines upon my insistence but the violent tendencies is still there. He told me many times that he wishes to change so that we can have a future. But everytime things escalate, he goes back into the same actions. Longest he ever maintained a change was for 8 days. I find him very immature for his age in the sense that he always feels that he needs to argue and win, even as i tried bringing up things to him by stating that ""When you do this, it hurts me..."" etc etc. I cannot handle his defensiveness or need to argue, anymore. I recognise that i am not the normal girl like others and i am ""damaged"" in a way, despite me successfully hiding it on the surface. Yet i am pretty certain that this is not how i want to live my life. I do not wish to have my hard work, in trying to carve out a normal life as much as possible, to be down the drain. And for me to lapse back into depression.My friends are split, one camp feels that i shld think more on the longer runway, the other calls for immediate end now. Ultimately, the final decision is my call. Should i insist on the house termination since violence has occurred ? Or should i take time to reconsider upon this longer runway?I do love him, but i feel that a short term pain is better than a lifetime of abusive relationship, as i was in a abusive family and i do not wish to continue in a potentially abusive marriage.-#97295: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97295","['Like: 54 people', 'Sad: 35 people', 'Care: 31 people']",135 Comments,23 Shares

No Hwa Chong boy would ever have the audacity to pull a stunt like this. No Hwa Chong boy will ever announce the fact that they went to Hwach. In fact, it is more likely that we'd try our best to avoid revealing our affiliation because this is a philosophy drilled into us since we were 13. Most of us will feel very uncomfortable telling people we went to Hwach.We were taught that the Hwach brand should be completely irrelevant to anything we say and do, because these things should stand on their own merit or demerit. I'm sure every true-blue Hwach guy would tell you the fact that Hwach has this odd rule that we should never wear our uniform outside of school, except when traveling to and from school. But then again, she's a woman. So either was trained by NYGH (nothing to do with us), or some other school. Lastly, HCJC has no value system unlike the high school section, because it's just two years of mindless mugging for A-levels. There's no real homogeneity in culture in the JC section, which functions more like an elaborate tuition centre.

97289,"Hi all, I'm local female/27, looking to settle down with my PR boyfriend of 3 years. However, there were some issues with my beau being an Indian of India national and 8 years older, and I'm from a local Chinese family with traditional values. I met him on my first job and he was my tech lead at that time. He had a dad bod and rich Indian accent that is hard to understand, coupled with this cheekopek look - as if he is checking out every single angle of me, I was really disgusted with this pervert at that time. However, me being fresh out of uni with some fire in me to seek career growth and with some confidence in me from my list of suitors since uni time, I tried seducing him in hopes that I can have a smoother route up the corporate ladder. I eventually succeeded and we hooked up. Our relationship started off as a fwb thing to me but little did I know that it was actually true love to him, as we progressed I also started falling for him. While he is definitely a cheekopek when in bed with me, at every other time, standing beside the petite me, he is like my friendly dark brown teddy bear which I just feel so comfortable and so warm with. I had recently accepted his marriage proposal and I am now cohabiting with him at his rented condo which he is working to buy off as our love nest after our marriage. We should be able to do so comfortably with both our salaries. He is happy to settle down with me in SG, as he plans to bring his parents over and has no plans to return to India. The only concerns left now are the disapproving vibes from my traditional Chinese family and circles of friends, hope that my nus peeps here can give me some advice on how we can navigate this carefully as we start planning for our wedding.-#97289: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97289","['Haha: 93 people', 'Like: 60 people', 'Wow: 12 people']",159 Comments,21 Shares

Has mental issues like depression and is stressful to handleWe also have a large age gap which I feel is causing a sort of generation gap where we are in different phases of lifeAnd to be honest, I do not think she would be able to earn her own keep in the near futureI realized she is clingy and tried to give her less attention to reject her, said that I would be busy building my career in the near future and might not have time for a relationship.But she only got more aggressive in trying to progress our relationship. She forces our relationship to progress,getting me gifts, constantly planning and paying for dates so I would accompany her , staying over at my place every day , I was feeling suffocated.I did not ask for all that and I did not need to pay for anything , but it was making me feel bad.She would probe me with questions like asking me what happens if she gets pregnant, and hinting for marriage She basically built her life around me and seem to have no lifeI tried to make her busy by talking her into getting a job, but she quit not long afterI managed to convince her that meeting up everyday is not right, and around once or twice a week would be plentyBut she started to twist the boundaries, we would only meet up twice a week, but she would try everything to involve meShe would ask to play online games with me, join my online meetings , video call me every day, every few hours....I am not sure if she is trying to play games, but she hinted that she might want to be in an open relationshipTo be honest, I do not exactly agree ,but I could not care less, she can do what she wants. However it might affect my reputation if my gf is seeing other men, its fine if we are FWB status, but not when we are official.All the little bits are starting to build up despite multiple talks to resolve conflictsI feel like I am being blackmailed to continue this relationship , but at the same time,there is nothing bad by staying around to get pampered all the time.All I need to do is humor her once in awhile, and even if we fought , things get resolved fast probably because she just wants to keep me around.I do not think we would last very long if this keeps up, but is it right for me to carry on enjoying the benefits while it lasts, while she lives her dream life with me?

97285,"What do I do if my bf always feels ""off"" whenever he pays for our things? Everytime we go out to eat, he insists on paying even if I offer multiple times. So in the end when the bill comes I don't make a move and he pays, but I can tell that he always looks and feels a bit upset afterwards. But the point is, seeing him feeling upset really ruins my vibe? I don't really want to talk to him much after because I feel really guilty to have upset him and don't want to make him angry, but I also don't exactly know what to do. For more info, the things we have are pricer but not crazy expensive (around 50-100 max combined) but we also don't go on dates very often. I also really don't mind paying and have offered many times, but the main reason why I'm currently not doing that is that I'm still doing full time uni (no job) but he's working. He told me since I'm not out in the workforce yet I shouldn't pay (which I also agree), but I plan to return the favour once I start my career. Currently I use my red packet money to buy him more expensive gifts for special occasions (birthday, anniversary) which averages around $200 each to try to make up for it. Back to the main point, is him feeling ""off"" whenever he pays something that will go away as he earns more money? Is this common amongst guys?? I wouldn't say he's stingy as he does pay which I do appreciate. But is this something I should talk to him about? How should I even go about the conversation? I love him a lot but it just really sucks to walk around afterwards feeling a bad vibe next to me and I feel so guilty afterwards.-#97285: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97285","['Like: 22 people', 'Haha: 2 people', 'Care: 2 people']",43 Comments,10 Shares

Yes, I think so. Maybe if I'm stronger in mind, I will be able to make it through. However, recently I have been thinking twice about applying for new corporate job because no matter what jobs I'm trying to apply, it feels like I'm self-sabotaging, giving all sorts of excuse to reject interviews. I think my previous job has really left such a great impact on me, and I just can't seem to be more positive in this job seeking. If I don't look for corporate jobs, my degree will be simply a waste and I have a study loan to pay.. Any kind soul can give me some advice as I'm really lost.. I have tried to look for sales jobs, HR jobs, marketing jobs, BD jobs.. But either I'm underqualified or I realized that's not what I want. I will constantly think, what if I join a company that has toxic environment again?  The process of joining-resigning is really exhausting.

But mostly because he's busy, if I want to be honest with myself lol. So he's a really nice person but he kept disappearing? We would be texting and halfway through, he'd let me know that he has to go perform an operation. Then he will not reply until 2 days later! I try to be understanding. Afterall, he did let me know that he'd be in the operation theatre but... for 2 days? Am I unreasonable if I hoped that after washing up he'd at least text to update me or continue our conversation? Usually after 2 days, he'd just start a new conversation, like ""Hi, how's your day today"" and when I ask about his, he will talk about his work as if it was something that happened days back. Not like, ""oh I just ended a 48 hour surgery"".Other than that, it's been going great. We had fun dates and we text and talk on the phone like normal couples. I haven't dated a doctor/surgeon before and I am wondering if I have underestimated how busy they are. Any medical students/ doctors/ surgeons or people in a relationship with one want to shed light on this? I'm still early in the relationship and if he is indeed being sketchy I won't want to continue this. If not, I would love to try to be more understanding towards him!

97269,"My gf always resorts to lies and false accusations to ""win"" whenver we argue. I have tried many times to tell her this is not only not constructive, it just creates new problems. However, just by telling her this will trigger her as in her mind, she must always ""win"" every fight. It is really exhausting for me. Some more these accusations being false, just hurt me deeply everytime. It really affects me badly.So if we disagree on anything, or if she said something offensive or hurtful to me, just me politely and factually stating this will result in a multi-hour or multi-day fight. I honestly do not understand how come she reacts like this and over the last thirty months together, have tried all kinds of ways to communicate with her, be it more nicely, more politely, different tone, whatever, but the result always the same. I won't even be able to get 1 single sentence in once she starts her rants which can easily become an hour long monologue of her yelling and repeating at me. I mean she won't even let me respond even if she ask me a question? I will say two words to respond and then she will talk louder over me. I will wait for her to rant for an hour, then try to get one sentence in, only for her to tell me I am rude by talking over her.Despite the above, she will gaslight me like crazy and tell me I have anger management issues, because I am upset at the above. I asked her not to gaslight me. She then told me I am a gaslighter and even said her only fault is getting together with me, all other faults are mine in the past thirty months. I said let's be reasonable, in any couple, if one belives in thirty months, that party has zero fault in every quarrel, surely that party is not being honest. She disagreed and repeats her rants in response.When we are not fighting she is a very nice and fun person but little things trigger her and she becomes the monster above.

97257,"I am a 35/M and I went to a top secondary school and JC in Bishan.I grew up around teenagers who prided themselves on their academic performance, on their CCA performance, and believed strongly that they will become highly successful people in the future. I had 2 classmates in JC, now best friends, who told me that they will hit a million dollars in annual salary by the time they reach 35, both of whom went to Oxbridge. Every single straight-A type that I knew had this air of arrogance around them, because I truly believe that they believed that they were better than the rest of us, that they will unerringly turn out to be more successful than any of us.There was this girl I met in J1. She was a quiet girl who was from a neighborhood secondary school who happened to be in the same OG and class as I was. She was really timorous, really shy. She didn't have the best grades, and was notorious for skipping CCA. I was always confused by how nonchalant she was about schoolwork, how she always copies my homework, and how I have never once seen her studying. She eventually retained, and I lost contact with her.I was recently having coffee alone at a cafe. She was fiddling around with the POS system. I recognized her immediately because she looked exactly the same as she did in JC. She did her hair up the same way. I approached her to say hello, and she told a younger girl to make her a flat white, and she came to sit with me at my table. We started chatting about the old days, and I found out she got BCCC/B at A-levels, and did business at SMU. It also turns out that she owns the cafe, along with 13 other F&B establishments in Singapore and JB. Her share of the profits in 2018? 2.7 million. I was speechless for a while. Meanwhile my friends who went to Oxbridge, one of whom on a PSC scholarship, are now civil servants, both earning just a little between 10-15K a month. That's a good salary, but I was mediocre in JC (ABBC/A) and even I am earning more than 15K as a management consultant.We have created a system of flawed meritocracy where children are brought up believing that just because you are the best in school, you're always going to be best in life. The logic is flawed because being the best in school just means you're going to be ""good"" in life. In most cases, you're just as likely as anyone to become ""great."" If we think about it, kids become great in school because they understand the system well, and because there is generally a very clear methodology to become great. As long as you don't challenge the system, as long as you work within the ""rules,"" you'll come out on top. In the real world, there are several lines of work in which it is valuable to be able to work well within a system. The SAF for example. Probably explains why the word ""scholar"" always gets paired up with ""general"" in Singapore.I think we, as a nation, need more humility when we think that the best people in school deserve more praise than any other student. People are good at different things, and school, being able to follow instructions to the hilt, is just one thing.-#97257: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97257",['Like: 1.5K people'],300 Comments,1.3K Shares

So he asked if want to have another one, i rejected but he insisted to put give it to me. I reluctantly accepted. It was weird that he didn’t drink the wine at all but I didn’t think much because I have met him several times alone. Later I fainted without knowing.

Thankfully there was always a group of friends who would adopt me into their cliques.Before I entered uni, I went through a little transformation (not plastic surgery) to make myself average looking. After which, many people including those who knew me earlier, complimented me for being prettier. Deep down, however, it remains hard for me to be more confident due to past incidents of being discriminated.I've had a number of guys confess to me since then. However, none of them was able to understand my insecurities and I was unable to explain it to them completely. These incidents seem so trivial when put in words, than when people experience such things themselves. Eventually, I decided to let these good guys go for fear that I would be a burden. People around me continue asking why I remain unattached despite being in my 20s. But I am not brave enough to take a step forward towards a better future. How can I build my confidence and live an average life, like all of you here?Also, I urge everyone to stop discrimination and bullying.

97162,"Hi, looking for advice.I'm at a crossroads & idk how to proceed into the next part of my journey. I've worked in sales all my life so I'm used to high pay, flexible (actly long) hours. I like my current job, good at it, clients are happy with me usually. But recently company has undergone a lot of changes and team dynamics have changed. Manager has become toxic, we don't even talk anymore. When we do in official communications, she makes it a point to 'lose my face' & shame me in front of other ppl. Tldr: it's time for me to leave. R/s is beyond repair at this point. I have 2 job offers from 2 friends now who hold me in high regard and know what I'm capable of. One is IT sales. One is corporate sales. The problem is the IT sales job was offered to me before the guy who offered it to me ended up sleeping with me. It's nearing recruitment period and he's been trying to buy me a lot of gifts. Basic is abt $5-7/k (I forget, I was drunk) + handsome commissions although idk what the estimates are. Company is big and booming and has been able to take advantage of covid situation. However, when I looked at the website, I rly cannot figure out like what kind of IT service they provide so product knowledge curve is gna be steep for me. He was telling me I'd have to go out for dinners with clients. I guess the only uncomfortable part for me is the fact we slept tgt a few times. I don't even like him. We were just drunk, bored, and horny. I wish we didn't sleep tgt but can tell he will definitely take care of me. It's just that this can also go really badly and he pimps me out or sabotages my professional life bc of personal feelings. Anw... other job is a corporate sales job. Basic is $4.5k/mth with generous comms but only after first year. Product training provided. Currently, I'm getting $3k/mth basic so both options are still an upgrade. Average covid sales match my current job's pre-covid average sales. Current job has not been able to adapt in covid. Average is $100k comms/year. Best sales is $600k comms/year. Sick. Working environment is good. All male industry and except for my friend who offered me the job, the other men are married, but this friend and I are platonic.I'm in a dilemma bc pre covid I used to rake in $120k/annum as a fresh grad in my current job but since covid hit, I'm barely hitting 30% of that. Most months maybe only 15% of that. Sucks... If I leave, I have to pay $20k penalty fee for contract severance. The only reason I stayed in this job is cos I don't wna pay the severance fee but after finding these 2 jobs, I'm seriously considering switching. Should I take the IT sales job or the corporate sales job tho? Have to send in my resume in next few days.

97159,"Need advice here !Tldr - My boyfriend's sister doesn't quite like me, couldn't really pinpoint as to what I have done wrong for her to have such a reaction towards me.I've been dating this man for almost a year and a half now. He is honestly nothing but sweet to me and I couldn't ask for anything better. He is my first official relationship but I am not his first. Everything is good between the two of us except that I have a little fear of going to his house because... his older sister doesn't quite like me.Just to give a little more context, whenever I go over to his house, I would always greet everyone, of course, that includes his sister no less. I would always buy enough food over for everyone which includes his sister's boyfriend as well. However, I was constantly met with cold shoulder or just a ""mmm"" whenever I was over. When I was invited to my boyfriend's house for the first time, I figured maybe she was just being awkward with me granted that that was the first time we met. But even after a year in, no matter how hard I tried talking to her, she would best give me a two words reply, if my boyfriend isn't near me, it would be met with silence and she would just turn away and walk back to her room.Before you all think that it is probably her personality, I thought so as well. Until my boyfriend invited over some of his friends for his birthday celebration and I saw the stark difference in her treatment towards his friends and towards me. You can imagine my face of disbelief when I heard her cracking jokes with his friends.After that party, it really did bother me quite a bit. However, I didn't want to share it with my boyfriend because then he would definitely confront his sister on that, and I wouldn't want to make his sister hate me even more! So I decided to ask my boyfriend a little more about his sister and he revealed that she was quite close to his ex (my boyfriend dated her for close to 5 years). So then I thought, she must have really treated my boyfriend's ex as her own sister, which it is understandable why she was so hostile towards me, now that I have ""replaced"" that spot. It didn't help when I found out that his sister is still in contact with his ex. Considered that my boyfriend did not really break up with his ex on good terms, and she had attempted  to get back with him, maybe his sister is trying to help her out? I don't want to speculate too much but I am also not a confrontational person. I can't just go over and ask her why she didn't like me when she barely even want to acknowledge me. I have tried many other means such as buying her gifts during x'mas, gave her handwritten cards, baked cupcakes for her (she loves pastry). At this point, I am really running out of ideas on what I should do next. It's been a year and I still can't figure it out! Please, I really need advice. Not a troll post...

97133,"I am lost at what to do. I grew up in a toxic environment where I was physically, mentally and emotionally abused. My father is a narcissist who thinks the world must worship him. He used to make my siblings and I do things against our wish i.e. dancing stupidly in front of him or other worst things for his entertainment purposes. And we’d be bawling our eyes out to make him stop but he wouldn’t and eventually gets angry and slap hard across our faces and said things like “get out of the room, I hate to see your face”. It got worst when I reached my teenage years. I got slapped so hard I couldn’t hear properly on one ear, kicked while I was lying on the floor because I wouldn’t stop crying from his slaps, called my friends to ask my whereabouts because he didn’t trust my words, threatened to hire PI to watch my moves etc. The list is endless. All this happened while my mother was watching whom we classify as an enabler. She could’ve and had that power to stop him because I have seen how fierce she could get with him if she didn’t get what she wanted but she did not stop him from raising his hands and voice at us. It came to a point where sleeping soundly was so scary because I’ll never know when he’d budge in to scream at me startling me from my sleep. The side effects from it now is I startle whenever I hear voices suddenly with my back turned or if someone touches me. I am in my 30s now and never had a boyfriend because of all the manipulative things they have done to me and the trauma I went through. I was always seeking their validation and approval that I forgo my own happiness and they started taking advantage of my generosity such as my time and money. I did not realise how toxic they were until recently, something triggered that all the childhood experiences came flooding through and I remembered all of it like it happened yesterday. I am still living with them and planning to rent an apartment because I am extremely unhappy with them. Not just my parents but my siblings too. I’m no longer talking to any of them and it’s hell. I do talk to my mom like nothing happened but inside I am reeling. Now, the question is, how do go none contact when I move out? Has anyone done it? Singapore is so tiny, I might bump into them and my relatives and I wouldn’t know how to react. I hate my family so much, there is no more love but hatred for what they have done to me. So to invite them over to my house for prayers or gathering seems hypocritical and I do not want them appearing at my door suddenly. I am also afraid they would depend on my for money and try all ways to keep in touch with me. They are also manipulative and could cry on command that I am grateful and how could I do this to them (when I reduced the allowance by $100) when all my life I was scraping to buy my own clothes and paid for my own diploma and degree.

97126,"TLDR; Do you think that Singapore has no more cards to play and is facing its decline? Lately, our news cycle seem to show that all that we are doing is to sit on the fence over the Sino-US conflict and about us welcoming Globalism as our way of life by sucking up whatever fart the west put out, in hopes to gain some from them through FTAs. (Think about those multiculturalism/ pro-immigration, environmentalism and feminism bullsh!t) Anyone agrees that SG will somehow turn into the likes of Taiwan someday, where people are underemployed everywhere due to the abundance of degree holders and diminishing job opportunities? Or we will simply turn into ""California""; a state filled with immigrants, disenfranchised locals who wants to leave and a very wide wage margin, albeit the creation of jobs by some foreigners? It appears that we are doomed when we lose our edge in several niche industries, influx of white collar immigrants that does not necessarily create jobs for Singaporeans and the resultant falling TFR.Please feel free to expand my list, but it seems like the following industries are failing:- Semiconductors was lost after CSM lost the race against the Taiwanese, Koreans and Japanese- Aviation industry due to covid or probably even to countries like Thailand and Philippines that can easily set up bigger ""hubs"" than Saletar- Marine industry to many other developing countries, due to its low skill barrier- Ports from the many emerging ones in China and probably even Thailand- O&G due to the push for all those environmental these, climate change that narratives- Biotech that never really took off despite the billions spent on biopolis-#97126: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97126","['Like: 36 people', 'Haha: 7 people']",37 Comments,2 Shares

For the entire semester, his only ""contribution"" is appearing in the presentation video (which had an individual graded component btw). He is also from IDP if that matters.

97118,"Like any other morning, it made its way out from the tree to hunt for food. It was none other than the famous cobra by the nickname “Sneaky”. However, today was different from any other day. Sneaky heard the sound of an Arabic music. It then followed the direction of where the music was coming from. As Sneaky got closer to the source of the music, the image of a bulky and tanned man began to surface. He was none other than HE. He was dancing happily in tandem with the Arabic music. Suddenly, there was a loud growl in Sneaky’s stomach. Sneaky was feeling extremely hungry as he saw HE dancing and smiling to himself. Then, an idea materialised in Sneaky’s mind. It decided to carry out the idea in its mind.Sneaky was feeling puzzled. HE was an obvious Eastern Asian Man yet he dressed like Aladdin with an awfully looking moustache. To carry out its idea, Sneaky proceeded to join him in the dance by moving its head along with the HE’s dance movement. Seeing Sneaky was moving along with his dance movement, HE was filling with joy. He felt that he was finally  able to influence living things around him. Feeling confident that he was able to influence Sneaky further, he decided to do something more risky. He descended his lip till it was few inches away from the head of Sneaky and did several dance moves involving his lip in close distance with Sneaky. Little did he know about the sneaky idea in Sneaky.As HE lips inched closer, Sneaky sprang forward to bit HE’s lips. Upon making contact, Sneaky injected all the poison from his fangs into HE. HE was caught by surprised as his dance usually would mesmerise snakes and will not cause it to attack. HE’s vision turned blurry as he started to succumb to the effects of the poison. As he lied on the ground, he saw a figure moving towards him.It was the Princess, well known for her benevolent and kind heart. Slowly but yet meticulously, she moved HE’s head onto her lap. At this moment, HE had passed out and his lip had turned completely black, just like the colour of charcoal. She knew that if no antidote was given to him within half an hour, HE would die. Princess knew that her physician had an antidote which was able to treat any poison. However, to get back to the palace, it would take exactly half an hour too.

He texts me good morning every day and was always the one to initiate a conversation. It was going so well when he suddenly just started ignoring me.

Saying things like ""oh if I knew you were going to SEP to this place earlier, I would have applied to go with you"" and ""I'm always here if you need me!"" but poof! Disappears when I drop in texts to check on her while on SEP, short answers to my reply on her ig stories, etc. The difference is that she was emotionally clingy and isn't a player per se, but just a popz kid hanging out with anyone else.I cut her off basically everywhere. We only have a finite amount of emotional energy so we should spend it most selectively. Helping others is fine but not letting other people leech infinitely.

97103,"I’d appreciate some thoughts on this issue I’m currently facing.Last year in June (when COVID-19 was at its peak), my friend got retrenched from her job and borrowed $500 from me because she was financially tight and needed money to pay off some bills. I did not think much into it at that time because 1) She’s a very good friend and 2) I’d help with whatever I can help with.She found a job in January 2021 and said that she could finally return me my $500. Fast forward to April 2021, she still has not returned the $500.I did not pressure her about returning the money last year because she was jobless and I did not want to add on to her stress. However, when I reminded her about returning the $500 in February and March, she told me to give her more time as she is financially tight. I don’t get it… she now has a job with stable income now but still unable to return me my $500. I even told her that she could pay pay bit by bit, maybe $50 or $100 at a time, whatever is within her means to pay the money back slowly. However, she told me she would prefer paying back the $500 at one shot. Here’s the funny thing, she claims she is financially tight, but on her instagram stories, I see that she goes out for meals almost everyday (btw, she dines at cafes and restaurants), having drinks at a pub almost every week. If she is not doing well financially, is this the kind of lifestyle she should be leading?I raised this concern of mine to a few friends who are in the same clique as us. Some of them agreed on my viewpoint but some of them just went..“Aiya, you come from a rich family, $500 is peanuts to you..why you being so calculative?” Yes, I admit I come from a well to do family however, I have never seen my parents money as my money. It’s theirs and theirs alone. What they decide to do with it has nothing to do with me. My parents worked hard to get to where they are now so I don’t see why I should be living off them. Besides, I work hard for my own things as well. It doesn’t matter if I’m rich or not. What matters here is integrity. If you borrow money, be it $2, $20 or $200, have the bloody integrity to pay back the money you owe. What should I do now? I’m kinda at my wits end chasing this friend to payback the $500. Should I just let it go or keep pressurising her to return the $500?-#97103: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97103","['Like: 43 people', 'Sad: 7 people', 'Care: 4 people']",16 Comments,7 Shares

She is the social kind of person, always hanging out with different groups of friends daily. She is also religious, actively participate in this chriatian association n goes to church weekly. She is staying at the school hostel n about a few weeks back she got really sick. For some reason she decided to tell me about it. Told her to go see a doctor but she refused saying that it was at night n if she didnt get better by morning she would go see a doctor. Me being a concerned friend decided to get her some hot food n medicine. I decided to drop the stuff at the lobby n go home after. When we met at the lobby, she told me to follow her to her room. Initially i didnt want to as her floor is for females but after she convinced me saying a lot of guys come there too, i decided to follow her. We ate the food in the pantry area then i asked her to eat the medicine that i bought. I also gave her vicks n a blanket as she told me she was cold. Wanted to leave afterwards but she asked me to hang around for a bit since she was lonely.  We ended up playing some games on the nintendo n watch a movie on netflix in her room. Halfway through the movie she told me that she was getting sleepy so i turned it off n got ready to leave. It was around 2am at this time. She told me to sleep there first as it was late at night n its dangerous to drive back since i was also sleepy. I wanted to sleep at the common area but she told me to stay with her.So i slept on the floor in her room using her yoga mat n a cushion. I plan to wake up early the next day n sneak out of her room b4 anyone saw me but because we were both tired, we woke up around 11. She checked if there was anyone outside b4 i left her room then i left. Bumped into this girl at the lift when i was leaving but didnt think too much about it. Fast forward 2 weeks, rumours began to spread that she slept around. She began to socialise less n avoid meeting up with me. This made me feel devastated as i dont have much friends n might have lost a really good one. I feel really useless now n angry at myself as im part of the reason for this.

97093,"Notice a lot of posts about sexual compatibility in a relationship. Cant help but notice the double standard in the comments. When a male confessor said that he has a higher sex drive, a lot of the comments will be like go pcc/diy to satisfy ur needs. When a female confessor said the same thing, the comments would be like sexual compatibility is impt in a relationship. As someone who has been in both sexual n non sexual relationships, here r my thoughts. I think that sex is just another activity that u do with ur partner. Its like playing sports or watching a movie together. If u both enjoy doing it then good for u. Theres no min or max amount of times u have to do it. If u have different sex drives, u dont necessarily need to find a new person. Try talking it out n see why they have a different sex drive level. Maybe u can also experiment with toys etc. Lots of stuff u can research about online. Compromise n communication is key. Also as mention earlier masturbation is also an option. Intimacy doesnt have to be just through sex, there r a lot of other ways to be intimate with ur partner.

97063,"#97022: https://www.NUSWhispers.com/confession/97022Hi All,Thank you so much for your kind comments. Thank you admin for posting my story. I took a deep breath before reading it and cried in tears of happiness (I definitely cried alot, haha). Firstly I would like to address that I did not blame my parents for anything. Back on those days, I just feel really stressful that they were pushing me to get something that are not in my capability but also because of their perseverance, I have gotten a local diploma in Accountancy. Which I am very thankful of for the rest of my life. This is my biggest achievement. I remembered before my dad went for heart surgery last year and he cried to my mom saying that he was so worried about me or my future. Back then after knowing it, I am surprise because he never let me know all these. I felt very unfilial because among my other siblings, he worried about me alot. But I don't understand why? After all I still earn a decent diploma salary ($1,900-$2K), just not as highly educated as my siblings and wealth off. But I know my limit, I never feel like I was earning very little because I don't splurge and I only need to fed myself after giving them allowance.I have been working for 8-9 years now. I am still frequently ask by interviewer or head of the higher rank on ""why didn't I go and pursue a degree?"". And every time this question was asked, I can't answer it. Because I don't have any excuses. I didn't even tried taking the course and know I failed or gotten expelled but at least I tried. I find it a waste of money to study and dropped out. In fact, the 10 years time frame for a 12 modules Advance RMIT accountancy is coming to an end soon. Which means that I have to take all 24 modules next time. Since I have saved more than enough, I am considering if I should just take part time degree and don't think too much already. I am not ready for my mental health issue but I can't let it drag me or delayed me if I want to achieve it. My mom continued to convince me to try. The only thing is my friends find that part time studying and working is very tiring and too much distraction. And studying accountancy is really hard for me. The last time I studied diploma in accountancy, my weight has gone down alot. I am overly worried about not able to understand or do well or even my increasing worsen anxiety which led to the hesitation for so many years. I actually had a childhood goal being an accounting lecturer/tutor in ITE because ITE Nitec was the lowest point of my life. But because diploma was too hard for me, I eventually didn't get to go into a local uni. (My perspective during that time when I could not get in is actually bitter sweet, I am happy I finally freed myself from this endless study and can start going out working but also I know I've disappoint my parents). If I graduated with a private degree, I could probably go there and applied to work. Since I don't last long working full time accounting office job once things get really bored. I don't really care about the salary, I just want to get back to help people in their lowest point of life just like how my ITE lecturer helped me. My lecturer was also a nitec student previously but graduate from NUS degree. ITE lecturer has their own criteria for entry so maybe private degree cannot get in also. I cannot put too much hope in this career.Personally I think way too much and ended up not taking any steps because of my fear. These 9 years I've been debating, should I do it? Should I not? I envied people graduating because behind that certification is endless of determination and hard work. But some of my friends closer to me knowing my situation has told me if you can't commit, don't take it. They know I've come a long way in the education path. While people over their 30s are getting married and BTO or already with kids, I am still thinking of petty stuff like taking a degree. I really hate myself. I didn't want this to become a regret for not trying but I hate putting myself in a situation whereby I ended up suffering tremendous stress just like how I did in my poly days. My dad wants me to be in good health and happy, so he stopped asking me to get a degree. He know I stop eating and cried frequently, once I get too stressful. While my mom feel like I should try 1 sems and see how it goes.

97062,"(Admin please don’t filter this out) Hi guys,I am about to graduate from my overseas university international program (SIM-UOL). Based on last year, my seniors took more than 1 year to receive the certificate because of the covid situation in London. However, they did well for their previous (year 1 and year 2) modules and received before their final exam. On the other hand, I didn’t do well in my previous (year 1 and year 2) modules as I was coping school with part time job. I am wondering when do graduates in my similar position apply for their jobs? A. Do you wait for your exam results for your final year exam to be out before applying for jobs?B. Do you apply for jobs right after your final year exams (before the results are out)?C. Do you wait until you have received your degree certificate to apply for job? Out of the three options, which is most preferred by employers and likely to reap better results (getting an offer, better compensation package etc)?-#97062: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97062",['No Reactions'],4 Comments,0 Shares

This requirement could be once or twice a week, or even three times, for about six months in a year. I am not an early riser and typically I get up at sunrise, and not earlier.  I'm single and live with my mum, and my aunt lives nearby and comes over for meals. Mum is still ok but now is starting to depend on me for more things. My aunt deliberately moved near us for a convenient arrangement. Taking the MRT is not an option as I can't wake up early enough. Changing jobs is not an option. My options are: 1) Taxi or PHV - the journey is 30 mins but sometimes I get stressed out when the vehicle takes too long to arrive, typically causing me to arrive minutes to spare before the starting time. PHV drivers have ever cancelled on me. 2) Buy a car and drive in the morning  - the driving is 30 mins but even entry-level models are expensive3) Show up the night before and sleep in office - I have a safari bed and sleeping bag at my workstation and access is via access card. Company has not said that I can't stay overnight. There are shower facilities as well. The disadvantage is that I need to have my access card with me if I go to the toilet or shower, i.e. consequences of forgetting that access card when going to pee is quite disastrous. 4) Rent a room 2-3 MRT stops away - this reduces my commute but the problem is getting my family to come to terms with this decision, due to the situation at home. Also, it is not everyday that I have to show up early to work. 5) Buy a flat 2-3 MRT stops away - this also reduces my commute, but gives me extra headache for renovation and similar problem with family accepting this decision. 6) Book a hotel room nearby whenever I need to - this is at least $100 per night for a room ...

97045,"I need to get this off my chest. Please don't filter.So recently, I met a semi deaf guy who was buying a pair of hearing aids as the previous seller that sold him ONE hearing aid sold him the most expensive piece he could afford. That bloody seller sold him just ONE piece when he needed TWO of it and told him to buy one side first, and when he saved up enough, he can go to him to buy the next side. LIKE SERIOUSLY? This type of money also good to earn? That poor deaf guy was working his ass off. I cannot believe there are seller like that. They are selling a necessity not a want item. How can they be so heartless? That poor guy is not even rich and he had to live with that stupid hearing aid that doesn't even help him at all for a few years. Imagine all the agony he had to live with. And wearing 1 hearing aid when he needed 2 is bad for his ear.Anyway, thank god he went to this brand (not here to promote the brand, so not going to mention the name), the consultant told ask him what is his budget and recommended him A PAIR that suits his budget and needs. Even though it was one of the cheapest pair, the consultant even spent time to slowly explain to him to the functions and what not. And even told him that there are hearing aids for all budgets. Doesn't mean the most expensive ones are the best. Guys, please spread the words, majority of the hearing aids consultants are salesman. They earn by commission. So if you happen to have a deaf relative or friend, please do get them to seek at least 2 opinions from different company before spending a bomb on hearing aids.-#97045: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97045","['Like: 181 people', 'Care: 33 people']",13 Comments,35 Shares

Was rejected by a role that I was pinning my hopes on.Failed around 6 government job interviews, including some that I was quite confident in (relevant skillset and experience). Some (HR, panel) were kind enough to let me know that other applicants are more experienced. Which is not surprising cos some did not pay much attention to me during the interview. But it seems that it is not my interviewing skills either - one was quite impressed with my enthusiasm. I wonder if other fresh grads are experiencing the same? Understand that market is very bad and I heard that some are not even getting interviews - in that aspect, is it safe to say that I am quite lucky...? I have some that are still pending, some that I have yet to attend. Sometimes, I think that it may be because of my written assessments. At times, I wonder if I am even fit for the role/govt as a whole cos the assessments are really daunting and I feel that I am not ""smart"" enough for them. I even question my worth, and wonder if I am even worthy enough to apply for the government.I am really very dejected at this point and wonder if I should stop applying for the government sector and focus my time on the private sector instead, or try out internships and traineeships. I even wonder if I should just take up any SME job that comes by but pays below 3000. It is a pity as I am genuinely interested in the government sector for my first job. At this rate, I may really be swallowed by the disappointment and tiredness from applying for government jobs that demanded for numerous intense assessments.

When I went for interview, my interview was kinda fast game kind, it was like a 5-10min thing, maybe it's normal maybe not, im not sure. but yeah i gotten the job next day, so i had to go back to the HQ to get agreement signed, when i was signing that agreement i asked the HR if uniform was provided and she said there isn't my size (she didn't even ask me what size i was wearing) then i was kinda blur if uniform was provided cause i asked her if I should come back and take my uniform and she said no. but still, i think that company should have atleast a blazer or whatsoever uniform, so i texted her and she told me that there isn't any uniform. (that's 1st)Because as a recieptionist at the Beauty Industry usually they do have telemarketing also where you cab start earning commission, so I asked the HR if there's commission and she said no (that's 2nd) I asked if light make up is needed she said no too, as now we have to wear mask no one can see it either (that's 3rd)Now that I started working the CEO came down to the outlet and ask me why am i not wearing their uniform? why didn't i put make up? like huh?? your HR told me all this is a no need oh and ya when i went to the HQ the third time because the HR remember that she didn't issue any uniform to me when i went to try it doesn't fit me and she ask me to buy my own at the company and expect me to give $100 deposit (fyi. those who gotten the uniform from the company have to deposit$100) but thank god i did not, but well in the end she told me that office say no need to buy uniform just wear full black now that the CEO said why didn't i have any uniform .. can someone please explain to me if this is normal? it's totally bullshit tho .. i had enough honestly and i ain't happy here, i just work here like 2-3 weeks only .. someone please tell me what to do, it's hard to find a job either.-#97037: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97037","['Like: 5 people', 'Care: 1 person']",6 Comments,0 Shares

97031,"The whole reason why a lot of Singaporeans still believe in the obligatory role of children as caregivers of their aging parents is a symptom of the hangover from our Chinese/Asian ancestry. The thing about culture is nobody actually questions it because we have all been raised to believe that all culture is sacrosanct. In fact, it’s not always the case. Cultures, like modern ideas of communism and capitalism, are just world views. Some of them make sense, most of them do not. There is nothing inherently valuable about preserving a particular culture. It might be useful to preserve specific values from many different cultures, but it makes no sense that the entirety of any culture can be said to be always good. At one point of time, slavery was a societal norm of a large group of people. At one point of time we had to live in fear of tyranny from imperialists. At one point of time, communism had resulted in the greatest event of starvation in the history of mankind. These are all cultures, and if we want to choose to deny the bad and only invite the good, then what’s the point in being a follower of a single culture if you’re just going to re-define it as you go? Isn’t it far more helpful to free your mind from the dogma of tradition and to make moral judgements about your actions based on modern definitions of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?Even though Singaporeans are generally well-educated, fundamentalism is rather rampant. If we were to abide strictly by the dictates of our Chinese culture, then we will find ourselves also believing in rather backward views about human rights. Gender inequality is massively problematic in Chinese culture. Many of our practices are also based not only on core Confucian values, but also of a complete lack of understanding of the scientific method. i.e A large number of us still believe Daoism is literally true. If we can’t get ourselves to question the wrongs in our cultures, how can we ever hope to progress as a country?-#97031: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97031",['Like: 51 people'],39 Comments,5 Shares
97028,"Hi all! I’d appreciate some thoughts on this issue I’m currently facing.Last year in June (when COVID-19 was at its peak), my friend got retrenched from her job and borrowed $500 from me because she was financially tight and needed money to pay off some bills. I did not think much into it at that time because 1) She’s a very good friend and 2) I’d help with whatever I can help with.She found a job in January 2021 and said that she could finally return me my $500. Fast forward to April 2021, she still has not returned the $500.I did not pressure her about returning the money last year because she was jobless and I did not want to add on to her stress. However, when I reminded her about returning the $500 in February and March, she told me to give her more time as she is financially tight. I don’t get it… she now has a job with stable income now but still unable to return me my $500. I even told her that she could pay pay bit by bit, maybe $50 or $100 at a time, whatever is within her means to pay the money back slowly. However, she told me she would prefer paying back the $500 at one shot. Here’s the funny thing, she claims she is financially tight, but on her instagram stories, I see that she goes out for meals almost everyday (btw, she dines at cafes and restaurants), having drinks at a pub almost every week. If she is not doing well financially, is this the kind of lifestyle she should be leading?I raised this concern of mine to a few friends who are in the same clique as us. Some of them agreed on my viewpoint but some of them just went..“Aiya, you come from a rich family, $500 is peanuts to you...why you being so calculative?” Yes, I admit I come from a well to do family however, I have never seen my parents money as my money. It’s theirs and theirs alone. What they decide to do with it has nothing to do with me. My parents worked hard to get to where they are now so I don’t see why I should be living off them. Besides, I work hard for my own things as well. It doesn’t matter if I’m rich or not. What matters here is integrity. If you borrow money, be it $2, $20 or $200, have the bloody integrity to pay back the money you owe. What should I do now? I’m kinda at my wits end chasing this friend to payback the $500.

97024,"Sharing some rs advice here that I'd wish I had known before.My bf and I are in long-term stable rs. In the initial phase of our rs, I initiated breakup few times cause I couldn't manage my emotions well and also had lots of insecurities. But he always pulled me back into the rs. Until one period he could not take the damage of my words and emotions that he said if I want to, we can. That was a wake-up call for me because I didn't want to lose him, I just did not know how to sit with the agony when things got rough and cowardly sought escape. After that, I never initiated. I constantly told myself, if this rs is important enough to me, I will not choose the ""easy"" way out.Fast forward to today, I still have some emotional issues and there are also some fundamental issues in our rs which is taking awhile to sort out. Few times, our arguments got so bad that he initiated breakup but relented after I promised to see a therapist. Thing is, I did not expect the act of initiating breakup can be so damaging to the rs and parties involved, until I got on the receiving end myself. So damaging that, even weeks after, I have repeated nightmares of him breaking up with me. I wake up shocked, I wake up crying, I wake up feeling so insecure and miserable sometimes. But I had to sit with the agony, because some part of me feels that I brought it upon myself. I started this whole breakup shit. I do hope seeing my therapist would help with this. And sometimes I wonder what unseen damage have I done to him back then, and I really hope he heals from it.The message I want to bring across is, initiating breakup, for whatever reason, is so damaging and you won't realize it until it's too late. At the point of bursting with frustration and helplessness, you may think, it's just few words. Let's see where it gets us. Maybe he/she will give in. Maybe he/she will feel sorry. Maybe I will feel better. But trust me, even if it seems to work for one or few times, it does long-term, permanent damage that you'd wish you had shut your mouth then. What worked for me, and I hope it works for you if you get into such a situation is, tell yourself to wait one day. Just wait. Exit the situation if you can't stand the atmosphere - tell him/her you need some space, go to another room, go grab Macs or just go do whatever you like. And if you still want to initiate breakup after one day, then have the conversation.And to anyone who hurt so bad from breakups or near-breakups, I hope you heal from it, however long it may take.-#97024: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97024","['Like: 113 people', 'Care: 25 people']",6 Comments,22 Shares
97022,"Never tried using this platform before but I want to share out my problem lingering for years. Hopefully admin can help me post this so I can get advice.Since young I've never excel in studies. I am always the student in the last class since young, I always find myself crying for lesson on the start of new school getting so stress up to try to cope with lesson, piles of difficult homework. When I bought my homework back home, my parents are unable to help me too because they are illiterate. Our family are not wealthy so despite my bad grades since young they will still opt for me to go home tuition or group tuition at CDAC. Eventually I still didn't get to do well and went to ITE Nitec. When I was signed up for ITE Nitec, I begged my parents not to let me continue study. Of course they didn't listen because a kid this young with only N level certificate cannot survive well in this society. I still cried every time I am in a new school, restless, unable to sleep, depressed which seems unusual as this symptom continued. Eventually I finished my ITE Nitec and was offered a Higher Nitec with the help of my home tuition and a good CCA, GPA 3.5 in total I was offered to get inside a well-known full time polytechnic. My parents was elated but for me it is just many stressful and crying days ahead. I've never love studying because I find myself struggling so much learning new things with poor understanding. Even with the help of home tutoring, I failed common test and module back in my poly days. At one point I wanted to give up. I won't be able to get inside this poly and finish this if not for my parent's perseverance. In the end, my grades wasn't good but I still passed.Afterward my parents frequently want me to go for a degree since I can take the advanced RMIT. Back in those days I've taken toll in my health. I had panic attack and forced myself to sleep during my younger days. My heart beat so fast that I didn't know what is wrong with me. I suffered from my 2nd panic attack back in my ITE days, total blackout in my eyes. I remember not having any breakfast every morning and crying secretly behind that smiling face just to hide my unhappiness. I often came back to school sitting at the corner of my room, just sat there thinking how to break the chain of studying and studying. Is life really about certificate? And without degree the job interviewer always feel like you've not completed your study pathway. Not everyone can do a degree some people just don't have the ability to, some are just not smart enough or even not strong enough to persevere their education after failing module after module. This time round my mother encouraged me to go for a try to get a degree while my dad knows how much I suffered and is satisfied that I have a diploma at least. I know how all these torment are going to come back to me again. Thankfully I did not suffered all these symptom/phobia when it comes to work. I've also not touch any books after my last graduation for many years. What should I do?  Do you have a degree?

Since young, he has been very controlling and strict. I remembered that I was not even allowed to touch the computer unless it is for official school purposes, much less go out of my house to hang out with my friends. I believe my anxiety disorder and depression came from him ( I am in a much better place now, though I would still get these occasional symptoms from time to time). Things escalated when I was in secondary 3 and I often fought with him, to the point that he would call the police on me and settle the dispute. My dad and I have never ever spoken to each other, and he passed away when I was 18 during my poly common test period. I felt really empty with no emotions when he passed away, and it feels like I am a heartless person, even till this day. So I was in a relationship with this girl for 3 years who I met from my poly days. We started dating during my last year in poly. But things started to get rocky during the last 6 months of our relationship. I could start to feel the distance between me and her getting wider and I really tried to salvage the relationship but to no avail. It came to a point one day when we finally sat down and talk and she told me that a guy who she met in SIT had treated her really well in school and she feels tired of me. Obviously when I heard that I flared out at her (my mistake) and things ended really badly from there.Sometimes I would feel that my life has been really shitty and could never erase it.

Aint the prettiest, a lil tall and probably a little alpha cos of how work oriented I am so I think guys wont like me...

Normally i dun think it will bother me, but i realise the kind of adult image and movie he like to see are quite violent and like humiliation, especially girls being ""defeated"" in embarrasing position.I confronted him about it, and he was very open about it and told me it was just like a fetish and he would never do anything like it in real life. I ask why he like to see that kind of thing but he say everyone has their own preference about such things, just because he likes to see it does not mean he wish to harm people. I feel it is true as he is a very gentle and kind person from many years i have known him, and he cares very much for me and people around him. He has never hurt me not even verbally and always respects me and put me before himself.I feel he is a perfect partner just only this makes me think.

97002,"During my freshman year, I attended an orientation camp and met my facilitator, a girl, who was one year my senior. I eventually fell in love with her after the camp and asked her out individually as ""friends"". However, I'm not sure if I was being ""friendzoned"" or gaslighted for almost 3 years. 1-2 times a week, we would go out, watch movies, and have dinners with just the two of us. So we went out at least once every week to just go out and talk and play. But we didn't have any skinship at all and were moving really slowly. Texts were not often, although I texted her good morning every day. We just kept going out and things didn't really progress officially beyond friends- no hand holding, kissing etc. As I'm quite shy, I asked her if she minded getting the couple seat at Cathay. She said she's ok with it, so I got it, thinking that may be a chance to hold her hand or something. However, when I try to sit close to her in the cinema, she kept moving away. I respected her boundaries and just sat apart as well. I would send her back after every ""date"" although she lives in the West and I live in the East. It takes 2 hours to commute back via MRT/Bus. So we just kept going out for meals/movies/outings at least once every week for almost 1 year? I was perplexed so I texted her a long message asking if we were ""dating"", and she said that she treated me as a friend! Like wtf who goes out one-on-one like that and text ""good morning"" everyday to a friend? Despite that, I continued on for another year as a ""friend"" who keeps going out with her alone at least 1 time per week. I even took a Korean class (which killed my GPA btw) with her to meet her more often than 1 to 2 times a week. This is because she said that she is too busy with her CCA (she's in dance) and can't meet so often. Then I realised every Valentines' Day, she will get at least 1-2 ""confessions"" from other guys. One of them happened in the very same Korean class that I was in with her, and in the confession that guy said that she spoke to him often every night to confide in him? She denied it and said that I was being very toxic when I asked if she really did speak to this guy often at night. She said she simply treated that guy as a ""friend""?!So I took a break from her and started dating other people. After that, when she started working as an auditor, she said she's very busy and can't spare more than one night per week with me. I said ok. So around 1-2 times per week, I would go all the way to her condo in the West to play basketball/table tennis with her, or would go cycling. Then take the 2 hour train ride all the way home. After almost a year of doing this, I asked her if we were ""dating"" again, and she said we weren't, and that she was treating me as a ""friend""? I'm so confused. Is she leading me on on purpose? Did she ever like me? Which girl has so much free time to waste my time like this? It's almost 3 years of going out 1-2 times weekly alone, with no skinship.-#97002: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97002","['Haha: 71 people', 'Like: 59 people', 'Sad: 17 people']",203 Comments,80 Shares

96992,"It's funny how someone so close could suddenly become a stranger. I guess this is the last letter to you which I will never send. Thanks for being my favourite person and best friend while we were still together. I still miss seeing your name pop up on my handphone screen, sending you milk & mocha bear instagram posts that reminds me of us, holding your hand and you being the first person I think of when I come across anything fun and exciting that we could do together.I don't know when cracks started to appear in our relationship. It might have been my own insecurity, the fear of losing you (irrational I know) that caused me to push you away. When you told me that marriage was just a formality, I felt my heart break because for me, marriage meant a lifetime commitment of weathering the highs and lows while still keeping our vows of ""till death do us part"". We once talked about couples and their ""honeymoon period"" and you said that you didn't believe in that because doing nice things for each other should be consistent in a relationship. But along the way, I started to fade into the background for you as you became more cold and critical towards me. Your friends became people whom you prioritised over me and whose opinions mattered more than mine.I knew that it was towards the end of our relationship on our anniversary celebration when you didn't sound too thrilled when I asked you how you felt about our 1 year relationship. When I asked you what you were looking for in a partner, you didn't want somebody who would build their life around you as you felt that it was too heavy for you to carry that burden. She would have to carry her weight financially in terms of equal contribution and you didn't want someone who was just a ""flower vase"" - looks pretty with no substance and she would have to have own passion and ambition. You were also looking for someone who could integrate well into your circle of friends. It took me by surprise because I never knew that you had such a checklist and that added additional pressure to what I was ""expected"" to be (being an introvert, not very career-minded & earning less than half of your salary) loved and accepted by you. I was hurt when you said that you didn't know that celebrating our anniversary was that special that it required a gift after I passed you mine. That night, my heart shattered from all the doubts, uncertainty and anxiety that accumulated from all our disagreements,  differences and feelings of being unappreciated & unloved. I felt that I wasn't ""good enough"" for you and knew that I needed a way out to love myself more. Even after all that has happened, I'm grateful that I had you in my life for that short period of time. It taught me more about myself, helped me to see my blindspots, and to grow. I've learnt that some fights are not worth affecting your relationship for and sometimes being kind is more important than being right. Although we are in different seasons of our lives and no longer in contact, I hope that you will be able to find your better half whom you will love and cherish and in return, do the same for you, always and forever. I will also try my best to get over and forget you even though it still hurts.-#96992: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96992","['Like: 26 people', 'Care: 16 people', 'Love: 3 people']",4 Comments,2 Shares

He would ask me to try out certain sexual positions while watching those films. I'm definitely new to it but I do love these intense actions and what he's doing to me.

This kills my mood as well and I ended up not wanting it either. ???? It wasn’t like this in the initial phase of our relationship, he will always be the one to initiate it and the way he initiates it makes me feel wanted and ‘attractive’.

I probably have a wrong understanding of the whole issue so I appreciate any help in helping me fixing my views.I have too main issues. 1) I am starting to find it really difficult and tiring to be in a relationship with a feminist. 2) After being with a feminist, I am confused and really wondering what exactly is feminism anyway.Don't get me wrong. I am all for woman empowerment. I am not perfect by any means. I was a chauvinist before going into this relationship and maybe I still am now, I don't know honestly. This might be a long post.I used to be a typical chauvinist. I did have certain ideas on how woman should behave, dress and interact with people. I always thought that I would only marry a beautiful and hot girl. Then, I met my current girlfriend. She was really funny and always full of energy. She was not pretty by normal standards but I did enjoy being with her so I thought I would give it a shot. She told me that my so-called ""selling"" point was that I was kind and caring. I loved to do volunteer work and help people, especially elderly, to make other's live better. I knew that she was a feminist. I told her clearly that I might have some chauvinistic views due to my upbringing and environment but I am willing to change my views. I did not want to make her feel as though she is treated unfairly or in any manner that would hurt her feelings. She agreed to take the leap of faith together and we started dating. It was going well when the cracks slowly started appearing.The problem started with clothes. I had no issues with her clothes until one day, she wore a really short fbt which was showing a little too much. I told her that it is too short and that it is showing inappropriately but she said that it is her right to wear what she wants. Ok, I apologized and backed off. Next, we were having dinner outside when I could see her bra strap showing. In my family, my parents would ask my sister to adjust their clothes if their bra straps showed and it is deemed as embarrassing. I told my gf that her strap was showing and she gave a lengthy explanation. Ok, I backed off again. So basically, I have no say in her clothes which is fine. We had gone on a overseas trip together before covid. There was this street to our hotel that had a lot of shady looking men. We walked through the street with no issues when my gf was wearing normal jeans and t-shirt. It was creepy but we did not feel any danger. Then, one night, my gf wore this skimpy outfit and we had to walk through the street. Everyone was staring at her, like literally staring without flinching. It was super scary. At that point of time, the safety of my gf was the most important thing to me. I instinctively took my sweater and covered her while quickly rushing off. Yes, I would have thrown my life to protect my gf but I might have only taken 1 or 2 guys down with me. There were at least 10 of them and they might even have had weapons. Back in the hotel, my gf scolded me like crazy for covering her. I was only prioritizing her safety. It seemed so unfair to me. At my brother's wedding, she decided to wear something very skimpy as well. Everyone was looking at her. A lot of them were looking at her inappropriately. It made me so uncomfortable and it was so annoying. I could not say anything because she would create a scene and I did not want to ruin my brother's wedding. I could not ask people to not look at her because again, my brother's wedding. I am fine with her wearing whatever she wants but she needs wear it at the appropriate place right? Am I wrong here to feel annoyed? I should wear boxers or just my underwear to her sister's wedding when it takes place.So if she decides to run around nude, I am just suppose to watch that happen without saying anything?Next issue. I can't help it ok. I like to look at pretty girls. Unfortunately, if a pretty girl walks past me, I tend to look at them. It is not something I do consciously. This ""chauvinistic"" and ""superficial"" action of looking at beautiful girls gets me into trouble with my gf all the time. I really put in effort to ignore but when I am really tired and in auto mode, my eyes just move on their own. I mean all the guys look at beautiful girls right? Sometimes I wish I can just pluck out my eyes so that I don't have to deal with this issue.Next issue, her constant nitpicking. I already told her that I had chauvinistic views but am willing to change. Every time, I say something chauvinistic, she blows it up into a huge fight where it ends up with me having to run after her or go to her house in the middle of the night or fights that lasts for days and sometimes weeks. I mean if I said something wrong, she could just correct me and explain to me.  I already said that I am willing to change. Now, I am very careful with what I say to her. I have to constantly think before I say anything, literally anything. If I offer to crack the crab shell, she might think that I think that she cannot crack the shell herself. Even if she is struggling, I can't say it because she will think that I think that she is not capable of overcoming it. I have to constantly tip toe around her and I feel like I am in a minefield. I just need to say 1, just 1 wrong word and it is just explosions all around.Then, sometimes, she would complain that I am not offering help. Then, I am like ""WHAT THE $&%?"". We had a few friends that are mutual. One time, one of the mutual friend got into an argument with her. I stepped in to help her and protect her. Then, she started exploding in my face saying that I am chauvinistic. Ok, then, I ****ing backed off. We had another similar incident again with someone else but this time I just watched while eating my char kway teoy, slurping every bite. Then, she complained that I did not back her up. What the *&#! am I supposed to do? After seeing her contradictory actions, I am really starting to wonder what is feminism anyway? Isn't feminism just being treated equally?I asked her since she wants to be treated equally, would she do national service? She just said that it is the men's duty to protect the nation. Then, I am like huh? She preached so much on equality.It is as if she just takes whatever that benefits her from equality and disregards anything disadvantageous that comes from equality. Is this feminism? Is the male partner of a feminist suppose to feel so cornered? Is this the future?I have worked on this relationship for 3 years. It is stressful to be around her and I feel quite lifeless. I am still holding on to the relationship because of the sheer amount of effort I have put into keep it together. I don't know if this will pay off or if am I just being a stupid idiot holding on to this.-#96959: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96959","['Like: 34 people', 'Care: 18 people', 'Haha: 12 people']",86 Comments,14 Shares
96952,"Hello, Here hoping for some relationship advice.For a background, I had been single for 25 years, never been in a relationship before, and recently met a guy from a dating app. We chatted for about 2 months and met up a few times within which. I would say we hit it off pretty well at the start. We had yet to gone official yet but I begin to feel quite uncertain about being in a relationship. Being single for so long in my life had made me to be someone whom is very independent. I am pretty comfortable doing things on my own, spending my weekends at home, not needing to go out. And i am also not sure “how to let someone else into my life”. I am feeling quite torn, always wondering if I am really ready to be in a relationship, and if he is “the one”. And as I recall why I started to use dating apps in the first place, it began to evolve into a moral dilemma question as I question myself if I was just desperate for some companionship and hence started dating apps, and whether I had the intention to commit to it in the first place.I am really not sure if I am overthinking it, and should I just let myself go and experience it more with him before deciding again? Both of us also had this talk and I was telling him my insecurities, he was understanding and he did told me to take my time to think about it.  It’s been 2 weeks since then and I am still feeling so unsure. It makes me feel so bad about it too especially since he is such an understatement person. I just feel that either way, I would be hurting the guy more if I continue to be this wishy washy. I am hoping to settle this asap, (either to take the leap of faith and convince myself to continue the relationship, or to not waste his time because I am not ready) - but I am not sure what would be the best way...-#96952: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96952","['Like: 24 people', 'Love: 3 people', 'Care: 3 people']",28 Comments,6 Shares
96947,"Please don’t filter. Need some advice here...I (26M) met this girl (23F) from dating app in September last year and we hit it off pretty well. She’s smart, lovely and hardworking and that really caught my attention. We texted each other like long lost friends and never run out of conversations. We texted each daily and only in December that we decided to officially meetup. After the first meetup, we made plans to met up every other weekend to spend time together. We would take turns to plan for the weekend meet and over a short span of time, we travelled to almost all places where a couple can visit in Singapore. One night after our dinner in January, she officially asked me to be together. I felt so comfortable around her and of course I immediately agreed to it. To be honest, I’ve never loved someone so much in my life before and I was so happy to have found her. I enjoyed every second with her and I see her as a life partner. Then on, I started having tons of plans for our future and want to eventually marry her and start a family together.She always wears a gold necklace given to her by her mum and she always tells me how much it meant to her. This is her first relationship and wanting it to be special and memorable for her, I bought her a pair of gold earrings to remember our first Valentines together. Hoping that the earrings will be something meaningful to her, I intend to give it to her and put it on for her at the end of the day. We went for our dinner and walked around the mall. I was acting the whole time after dinner as if like I was looking for a gift for her. In fact, I already got her something. We walked pass a goldsmith and I just looked at the gold pieces on display. She held onto my hand and told me not to buy anything expensive for her or she’ll be angry and she pulled me away from the shop. Not wanting her to be angry, I kept the earrings in my car and only gave her a bouquet of tulips that I got beforehand. Till today the earrings are still with me.After being together for a few weeks, her text came in short streams and replies came in after hours. Back then I thought she’s just busy with work and doesn’t have time to reply and I didn’t think too much. Our weekly planned “dates” started becoming just a normal lunch and head back home kind of routine. She started being cold towards me and I wonder what I did wrongly to upset her... I wanted to find a chance to talk to her and fix things but never had the chance to do so. Just days back on our weekly meetup, she told me she want things to end. She told me she just don’t feel it with me, she don’t see a future with me and she’s sorry... That really broke me... From a life ahead of us, everything just crash and ended there... I started having sleep issues and a great loss in appetite. Whenever I close my eyes all I can think is her. Whenever I get some proper rest, I’ll dream of her and wake up crying... Sometimes tears just roll uncontrollably when I’m at work... I always look at my phone, hoping to see a text from her. This if affecting me badly and I just can’t forget her... I really love her and I don’t want to lose her. What should I do... Please give me some advice...-#96947: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96947","['Like: 58 people', 'Sad: 48 people', 'Care: 39 people']",73 Comments,23 Shares
96945,"Is it ever acceptable for a married person to insist on a divorce even though his/her spouse has done nothing wrong?My mom has recently suggested that she wants a divorce with my dad even though my dad is possibly the most responsible and faithful father and husband in the world. Since they've been married 25 years ago, my father has surrendered all income to my mom and received a small allowance every month. He is a freelance consultant and he earns close to $1500 every DAY, but my mom only gives him $3000 a month. Any more and he would have to ask for it. My mom deals with all the finances at home. The condo is paid off, a gift from my grandfather on my dad's side. My dad does all the cleaning at home, he washes up after every meal (even though my mom always cooks), he does the laundry, and he does all the repairs and maintenance. My mom calls herself a ""housewife"" but honestly, my dad has been more of a ""housewife"" for the 25 years I have been alive. My dad doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, he works his ass off for the family, and he also buys her presents/dinner EVERY SINGLE year on her birthday, on their marriage anniversary, and on the anniversary of the first time they met. He spares no expense, DESPITE the fact that he only has $3000 a month to spend. My mom, on the other hand, never remembers. She even had the audacity to say to me, after I asked her why she never once bought anything or even wrote a nice letter to my dad on his birthday, that ""[she] cooks for him every day."" I am speechless.But let's just set that all aside and let's discuss the institution of marriage for a moment.When we marry someone, we promise to be with them for the rest of our lives. It's a commitment, it's a contract. If anyone ever doubts that they will be able to make the commitment of time, then they should never have agreed to enter into that contract in the first place.My mom is suggesting a divorce because she feels, and I quote, she doesn't love my dad anymore. The whole framework of my dad was destroyed, and he still continues to work. I have not spoken to her for 6 months after I heard her say that to my face, and I will probably not speak to her for the rest of my life. Please respect the institution of marriage. When you're married to someone, unless he/she is unfaithful, or does anything illegal, please, don't mess around.-#96945: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96945","['Like: 207 people', 'Sad: 102 people', 'Care: 25 people']",123 Comments,71 Shares

To the commenters - Single and moving out is unfilial? Married and move out and you are filial? Logic of these commenters. Just shows how toxic people are towards singles. Single premium is real at work (eg annual childcare leave) or at home. Moving out when you are older is considering abandoning your parents? So those who move to their own BTOs at age 25 are way more unfilial, after all the author spent 7 more years living in with her parents. Oh and paying rent is poor financial planning, should be giving the cash to parents yeah? Since there’s usually space at home, married couples should not buy BTOs & just renovate their own rooms to live in with parents. This way you will be giving your parents the money otherwise spent on servicing 99-year HDB mortgage for their early retirement. Oh wait a minute that sounds a little strange to you, isn’t it?

96934,"I’ve recently been diagnosed with a chronic disorder. According to the doctor, although its not deadly, it is currently still incurable. But I’ll still be able to lead a typical lifestyle except during relapses, which is unfortunately, unpredictable as there are no known triggers. The problem is, the doctor said that such disorders may be due to genetics, which means that if I have children in future, they might get the disorder. My boyfriend and I originally intend to have children in future. But because of this, I have expressed that I have changed my mind about having children for fear of passing down this illness to them. I’ll feel very guilty if our children’s lives are affected due to our decision (the pains of the relapses, having to live on medication etc). However, my boyfriend’s stance is that we should still give it a try since there is no guarantee that the illness will be passed down.  I really don’t think it’s right to take the risk knowing the possibility of passing down the illness, but he seems unconvinced.He is also not open to the idea of adoption as he wants his very own child, and that his parents are quite traditional and are likely not to agree too.I don’t want to go down the route of breakup as we really love each other alot.

96930,"So this happened today:I have ordered my food and looking for a seat while the food was prepared at one of the food courts in Jurong East. It was during the peak dinner time and the seats in the food court was mostly full, making it difficult to find a seat. After searching for some time, I saw this young couple in their early 30s who was eating with 2 empty seats beside them (it was a corner table) and I asked politely if I can sit beside them. To my surprise, I was promptly rejected and their reason was that they were not able to sit beside us as the rule was each group need to be separated by 1m. That made me really angry as firstly, I thought that it was only 8 people that needed to be separated by a meter, regardless of them being strangers or not (which I was wrong after I went to government website to check, they were in fact in the right to reject me) and also by the fact that this young couple was one of the only couple that rejected me in my days of eating in a crowded food court (post covid). I never had these kind of problems in town area during lunch hours and was not sure if it was a common theme among younger generations to be so anal, for a lack of better word, about these kind of things.For me, I've never rejected anyone who wishes to share a table for the simple reason that I value efficiency (I'm by no means a good person/saint). Perhaps we need to be strictly following what the government says about social distancing and the right thing is to suggest to the fellow diner to consume their food in the toilet cubical, especially so if you are rushing for time since I value my piracy too much to share this table with you. (or maybe the dude is really concerned about covid spreading). Eventually I managed to find another couple in their 50s who were VERY willing to share their adjacent seats with me. But guess what? After I've consumed my food, the previous couple actually found a safe distancing ambassador to speak to the manager of that food court who went to on inform me that our young Singaporean couple was indeed right to reject my request and she told me that I shouldn't forcefully sit with them which I didn't (though I did indicate my intention to sit with them to consume my meal). Note that this couple actually went around the food court to look for me as they had no idea where I went to sit at as I was at the other part of the food court (or maybe I might have already finished my meal, but these guys were determined!)There are some bits and pieces which I left out and I'm not fully proud of my actions as I sort of lost my cool when confronting the young couple initially, I admit that they are on the right side of the law and I was wrong to call them out when they are doing the right thing, but I'm just amazed at the lack of empathy shown to a fellow Singaporean. Maybe I'm completely out of line here and this couple should be the epitome of a good Singaporean, or maybe I'm representing the majority, who would volunteer their adjacent seats to others in need.

96907,"Prof Ben, seek your opinion on work related stuff. I’m a fresh grad and had just started work for a year. In the beginning, I was happy and mix well with everybody. In work,I have a group of friends that I always will hang out with, not super close, but consider a family at work. Each of us will help each other and we work closely as a team. When I was new and not sure about the workflow etc, they will help me and I accepted their help.Slowly, I learnt more, and I have my own judgment on things and I do not need their help so much like before. But this group of friends think that I’m still a baby and always ‘help’ me on things that I should be making decisions by myself. There are so many episodes but I tahan and didn’t express because I think they are out of good will to help me.One day, this colleague she did the same thing again. I was working and I had an answer in my mind already, she jumped in and gave a different instruction to my clients that is totally not what I wanted to do. I stopped her in front of the clients, before she could further explain what she wants to do to them. I didn’t accept her help this time because I think this’s serious and if the client has any accident happen I will be the one people will place blame because the decision is made under my account. So I stopped her right in front of the client’s face. She angry. She angry coz i didn’t respect her, and cut her off in front of clients. I am angry too. So we fought. I was angry because she has been making judgment call all day long and without discussing w me, she directly told my clients what she wants to do, and all that decisions are documented under my name. I will be the one who will attend court if harm is made, not her. Professionally I’m right, my decision is in the best interest of my clients.I confronted her but she think she not wrong, she thinks it’s my fault because I refused to accept her help and I disgraced her in front of clients.I brought this up to my superior. But she is very good at talking. She told boss that the client may make complaint to our institution head because of the way I talk to her as client might think we dunno know our work well hence we have different opinions. And I kena scolded by boss for this. I explained my point of view to my boss that she doesn’t know the client well n yet making call without consulting me first. But I don’t know whether she got scolded by boss or not. Ever since then we seldom talk. We used to talk about life/bf/jokes but now we only talk about work related things, like we are not friend anymore. I’m worried that if I start to be friendly to her she will turn around and talk behind my back, which she always does. My concern is, I might lose my social circle if I’m not friend w her.  At work, we somehow will need to socialise and i feel sad of losing a ‘friend’ at work. Although she is not my good good friend but I stand a chance to lose my gang at work. I dun care about her because professionally I’m right, I care about my social circles. But I dunwan to be so fake like her. Idk I somehow turning to be the Adult I used to hate. I know I’ll keep changing to fit this world, and I dunwan  to lose ‘me’.  So prof Ben, how do I draw the line to distance them from changing me and at the same time keeping my social circle?

96906,"I've been thinking a lot about a certain issue, which is that most asian parents seem to demand an allowance from their children once they start working. I think it definitely makes sense to help out your family if they need it, and everyone I know around me definitely does - but why is it treated like an actual obligation, to the point where it pretty much becomes a MUST to give a certain % of your salary or you are just deemed terrible? Why does the current older generation place such an emphasis on this, that it feels like all children are basically seen as a long-term 'return on investment' by them? Are children just seen as some kind of insurance for old age? Between you and your partner, you decided to bring life into the world... because you wanted a child, right? Or was it because you needed some kind of payout guarantee when you grow older? And between you and your partner, shouldn't there be a plan to work together to enable your own retirement savings are sufficient? I mean, I believe when my partner and I brings a child into this world, it is because we want one and not because we want them to pay us and settle our bills in old age. Isn't that what our own retirement savings plan is for? I mean, I think it should definitely be expected that, as a family, anyone should be there to provide the time and care needed when parents grow old and aren't able to care for themselves - I'm really just wondering why there's so much pressure to 'pay them back' financially like we're just a fixed deposit account they signed up for 20 or so years ago.I'm wondering what those of the younger generation think about this.

96901,"*apologise for any error or typo, and mentioning of race to try explain the story, and it might be complicated*I was at Bishan Junction 8 pet lover's today, 15/04/2021 at 7:28pm. My friend and I went into the store to get some hamster treats. When i first went into the the store, there was already a chinese lady who was with her son talking to 2 of the staff working there. There was also another indian lady at the payment counter. My friend and i didnt think much, we were just looking at the pets and then we started hearing this lady shouting. The chinese lady turned out to be a freaking KAREN LOL.KAREN kept shouting at the staff and shouted things like-""I'm very disappointed in you""""You will have to pay for it, you're responsible""""I will complain about you""""We are very sincere YOU KNOW"""" I CALLED YOU AT 12PM TO TELL YOU WE WILL BE COMING DOWN TONIGHT""""THEY HAVE PIANO LESSONS YOU KNOW""( referring to her son and her daughter who was with her husband which both of them were not there at that point of time )"" DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO COME HERE FROM EAST COAST???1111?1!11?1?1?1?11!!"""" DONT SAY SORRY TO ME SAY SORRY TO HIM"""" THEY CAME HERE WITHOUT EATING DINNER YOU KNOW?!?!??????!?""THIS karen was shouting and saying that she came in yesterday but because the store was closing, they couldnt make up their mind if they want this freaking rabbit, so they said they will come back today. I didn't get the any of the staff's name but the staff who talked to this KAREN on the phone told her the Pet lover's policy is that they are not allowed to reserve pets just by using words over the phone( they said the call was made at about 12pm ). common sense ?? no ?? no guarantee no nothing, just words? The indian lady also called up the store to give them a heads up, the staff also said that she also told the indian lady the samepolicy and there is also another customer who is interested in getting the rabbit.The Indian lady was there first and already bought the necessities for her new pet rabbit, like cage and whatever not. When she paid for everything, Karen went into the stall and found out that the rabbit was already sold. KAREN was obviously unhappy and started shouting those things above. She also raised her voiced at the staff asking"" WHO IS IT ?!? WHO YOU SELL IT TO ?!? ""and the staff pointed to the indian lady beside her son LOL this KAREN dare not shout at the Indian lady so she took it out on the poor staff ????The staff again, tried explain to KAREN why the rabbit was sold, and kept apologising. KAREN BEING KAREN obviously shouted even louder and louder infront of her son. So Karen called her husband down LOLOL typical Karen move. JUST SAYING, the husband did nothing at all and he kept quiet the whole entire time. So the more Karen couldnt get the cute rabbit, she kept asking her husband to do something about it.So KAREN and family was blocking the entrance, the staff who was being shouted at started tearing up but quickly wiped away her tears and went out behind them to welcome other customers in. Karen wasnt done so she stepped back and continue barking at the staff. The second staff went to call the supervisor and tried explaining the situation but also broke down. The supervisor told the staff to call security and then security came down. When 2 of the security came down, they asked the safe entry staff ( because he was the one who called them ) what happened and he just pointed to all of us. I pointed at KAREN. When Karen saw the 2 security officer, she asked them 'What's the problem?? can you solve this for us? no? I'm dealing this with her!1!1?!?!?1!1!"" and the staff didnt want to trouble them so she told them it's ok. So  basically the security guards just stood beside Karen's family and did nothing but kept quiet the entire time LOL thanksThe staff apologised again and said that she understand that she's very angry and it's her fault.  but KAREN pointed to her children and told the staff - ""DONT SAY SORRY TO ME!1!1!1!11!!11!!!!!!! SAY SORRY TO THEM""The staff didnt hesitate a single bit and step forward and apologised to KAREN DNA kids. LMAO the entire time when KAREN was inside the store with her son, he was just staring into blank space. Suddenly he 'cried' when the staff apologised and went behind KAREN. At this point, I told my friend about it and he stepped forward. He told KAREN to not raise her voice and to not shout anymore because there were many passerby who stopped and stare. It must have been really embarrassing for the staff what??? Karen not happy so she told my friend -""Keep quiet, I'm having a conversation with her""My friend fired back saying, "" No you're not, you're shouting at her and she dont have to deal with your attitude"" KAREN'S PRIDE MUST HAVE BEEN HURT at this point, and she asked my friend "" WHAT ATTITUDE?!1?1?1! ""My friend then told the staff-""just go in, you dont have to deal with her attitude""He then looked at Karen and told her"" if you're unhappy, you can just call the police.""Then at Karen's husband"" Please control your wife ""KAREN'S HUSBAND kept tapping her arm said let's go. NO USE LORRRR. AND SHE OBV DIDNT CALL the police la cause she knew she was out of line I pulled the staff back into the store and she kept telling me she was okay and it was her fault. Then i told KAREN she was abusing the staff, she's so crazy in the head she can ask me how is she doing that. HER daughter who is about like p3/4, said to me "" but we already called about the rabbit "" lmao and i answered, didnt the staff already tellyou about their policy ???I told her she have been shouting and raising her voice for 30minutes. "" ARE YOU SURE 30MINS ?!??!?!?! """" urm yes ???? ""and then she kept quiet LOL and then she ask me to SHUT UPso i was already very frustrated at how self entitled she is, i shouted back at her.i told her to stfu and shes a f*cking b*tch, i know it was unnecessary but she really went out of line by shouting at the staff NON STOP. demoralising the staff by saying she's irresponsible and unreasonable. telling the staff she will pay for itblah blah nonsense ????? this my first every time witnessing a karen. SHOUTING and fighting over a freaking rabbit. Then her daughter suddenly went from like omg we called about the rabbit to ma im sorry we dont want the rabbit anymore. One of the secuirty uncle looked at me and signaled me to keep quiet and not say anything. LOL OK THANK YOU COMING DOWN you can go back up and secure this mall. please restrict all karens next time thank you ????SO karen gave up after she was being fired back atand started walking away and mubling to herself. HOW is she not embarrassed for acting so rowdy and disgusting in public over a freaking rabbit???? Even when the staff cried infront of her, she have no freaking remorse or whatsoever LOLI hope pet lover's do not believe the shit this KAREN says LMAO-#96901: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96901","['Like: 299 people', 'Haha: 111 people']",153 Comments,167 Shares
96888,"Hoping to invest in a commercial property with a rental yield of around 5-6%. I’ve been searching for one for at least a year by now and none come even close to 5%. The best one I found was 2.5%. How am I supposed to service the installments if the rental income doesn’t cover at least most of it? I’ve also recently been looking into JB properties, talking to property agents, and plenty of commercial shops in JB give around 5%. My question now is, and I’m hoping some of you are knowledgeable on this, will JB properties appreciate a lot faster compared to SG properties? Will I be able to double my property value in 10 years with an SG property?

96865,"Hi, I'm not sure how to start so I'll give a little context. I've been with my girlfriend for almost 6 years. I love her very much, although she has a lot of body problems and seems to be unwell and unhealthy all the time. She doesn't have any serious sickness, but near every other day, she's not feeling well / got headache / feet pain cannot walk / chest pain / eyes tired and pain / stomach upset, etc, just generally there's always something wrong with her. I've tried to accommodate her as much as I can and have spent a lot of time and money fetching her to clinic and buying her vitamins and supplement hoping it will help.At this point it may seem I am complaining about her body problems but I'm actually not. I don't mind to care for her. What hurt me is the way she treated me when I myself am unwell. Compared to her, I am relatively healthy, I rarely got sick and am in good health majority of the time. But recently I got appendicitis, and even after operation the surgery area hurt a lot for almost 2 weeks. And she became very sarcastic and cold, telling me to ""not make pathetic looking face"" and ""please don't talk in that weak voice"". Once I twisted my ankle while playing badminton, and while going home she told me not to lean on her because it's very shameful for her.Similar things happened a few times before, she becomes very cold and tells me not to ""act weak and pathetic"" when I am injured or not feeling well. I actually brought it up to her recently and said it hurts a lot when you do that, as I try my best to care for you. And she got really mad and said I don't understand that girls want a strong man. She said things like ""no girl wants a guy that act weak"" and when I said sometimes it's really painful especially my surgery, she got even angrier and said ""do you think it is worse than period?"". I said I'm not asking you to care for me, just to understand it hurts, and she kept saying all girls hate guys who act pathetic and guys don't understand that girls get pain every month and we don't have the right to act weak.Do a lot of girls think this way? I don't have a lot of female friends. It's hurtful as, I mean her periods are not my fault, I've tried to be as helpful and accommodating as I can when she has them, which I feel is the least a guy can do. Plus she has a lot of other problems which I try to take care of.

96863,"Just a rant that many people might not like (maybe admin doesn't like it and won't bother posting as well).I think majority of Singaporeans are getting less and less competitive. Becoming more and more like the US, anything goes wrong just blame others, never their own fault. Blame others for taking away their jobs, yet never reflect and see if they themselves are providing more value to the company. If you can't compete on price because of difference in cost of living, then compete in terms of value. I've seen Singaporeans around me who grew up in low-average income families, and yet they can achieve high positions and comfortable salaries. Why aren't they losing their jobs then?Any positive data they the government provides, such as improvement in economy or drop in unemployment, it is always bullshit to them because they are not part of the % who have improved. To them, if they are suffering, means others must also be suffering. I don't even come from NUS, I'm from a mediocre university with mediocre results and no CCA or accomplishments to speak of, yet it is still not impossible for a fresh grad like me to find a job. Though the salary is not as high as some of the salaries I've seen on this page, it is still a job I want nevertheless. I even have friends who went for courses under skillsfuture and found jobs from there, without having a university degree. And yet there are people claiming that this is useless?If you can't help yourself, no one can help you. These are the kind of people they will claim that I'm being a government mouthpiece, because they don't have any valid counter-arguments.

Which job should I choose?Company A: $5k/ mth. No bonus so meaning I’ll earn 60k per year fixed regardless of my performance. 1.5 hr travel time from my house as location is a bit far. Highly related to my course of study. Relatively stable job and environment is friendly/ not very toxic. Progression is slower as staff tends to stay very long in their posts and lateral movement is also difficult. Job scope is pretty fixed and likely I’ll be doing similar stuff 5, 10 years later or even longer.Company B: 4.2k/ mth. Total Bonus ranges from 1.5-4.5 months depending on performance. 50 min travel time. Not so related to my course. Environment is more competitive and demanding but will have higher chance of progression and bigger pay rise if you perform well. Company likes to rotate its employees so I can’t expect to stay fixed to a role even if I love it. Has a history of retrenchments during bad times and also asking poorer performers to leave.

96855,"The pleasures and sorrows of hospital pharmacyTo establish my background, let’s just say I have served at an understaffed hospital outpatient pharmacy for what feels like an indeterminate infinity.The pleasures: first and foremost, the chance to observe life and be philosophical about it…My job provides me a unique position to interact with numerous people daily, the majority of whom have suffered from various diseases, some of which appear quite invisible to society, yet very obvious to me.The rich and the poor suffer illnesses alike, but as inequality strikes, the poor suffer more, for they often cannot afford their medications. Many are under government assistance. I can glimpse a glimmer of embarrassment in their eyes when they collect their free medications. For these deserving poor people, I try to make the process of not paying for medicine as blasé as possible, without embarrassing them. In other words, I have the pleasure to deal out hope and kindness in people’s bleakest of times.The ones that get my goats are the filthy rich who stay at good class bungalows and try to cut the registration line. Their stories are implausible, excuses laughable, often clinging to their status, wealth or connections to some VIPs. I am so and so and I know so and so. Likewise, some of the extreme poor, with little to lose, will throw outright tantrums at the pharmacy in order to have their ways. Under these circumstances, I can’t help, but strangely and un-regrettably indulge in the guilty pleasure of judging these people immensely.One after another, grown men and women rise to their feet, walking or hobbling to my counter to pick up the medications to alleviate their pain in one way or another. I observe first-hand how people suffer at different stages in life. For the female sex, their problems can be Flagystatin for a yeast infection, then Misoprostol for an unwanted pregnancy and at the later life stage, Vagifem for post-menopausal dryness. As for the male species, they may need minoxidil initially then sildenafil and may even progress to PGE injectionsFor the other poor unfortunate souls of both sexes, they may suffer from some obscure congenital diseases that destroy their kidneys and start them on the path of dialysis and transplantation and a lifetime of hospital visits. Perched from this vantage point, even my over-exhausted brains can’t help but feel saddened for those who suffer relentlessly, for the patients, for the carers… Somehow, even wedged in the middle of the maddening crowd, we nevertheless retain some compassionate reflexes, a remnant of empathy for a suffering human fellow.The patients, their bodies and minds, ravaged by diseases, often lead them to voice endless hostilities against hospital staff. Some of these people go to the hospitals daily, their eyes sometimes filled with hope but more often, despair.I go to hospital daily too. But unlike them, I am paid to be here. So, I try not to take any of the verbal abuse personally, even though they like to threaten to write my names in the feedback form, which may reach my management and may or may not affect my KPI. But frankly, I am beyond caring about pleasing the upper management who live in their ivory towers and care little for the “real” frontline staff.What about the sorrows?Towards the end of every workday, I am physically and mentally exhausted, from talking 8-10 hours non-stop to people, explaining not-always-logical healthcare policies to them, telling off the ones who try to cut queues, calling doctors to discuss the therapies, etc . All these are done under the disapproving eyes of impatient people staring daggers.  Some of them circulate like flies unhelpfully near the dispensing counters, demanding their medications to be given out immediately without regards to the other fellow patient beings.Little did they know, our upper hospital management subject us to the same waiting time criticism, yet neglect to point out that we are perpetually short of staff because the management cannot afford to employ more people because millions of dollars have been spent on an expensive IT system that has needed 34 updates since its implementation three years ago. I wonder whether the IT system might not be part of the very problem that it had been designed to address, whether its production was not indeed contributing to precisely the feelings of frustration and nervous tension which it claims to alleviate.I wonder out loud to my colleagues why in our society the greatest sums of money so often tended to accrue from the sale of the least meaning things, and why the dramatic improvements in efficiency and productivity at the heart of any Quality Improvement Projects so seldom extend beyond lip service.Staff are exhorted to complete the department feedback surveys multiple times. Improving staff morale rarely extend beyond endless early morning meetings and brainless engagements that in fact exhaust staff more.Never far from doubting the wisdom of my own career choice, I was quite pleasantly surprised when a friend at a gym commented “Meaningful!” when told that I work as a pharmacist at a hospital.When does a job feel meaningful, really? Whenever it allows us to generate delight or reduce suffering in othersTo be honest, I am jaded but, stoically I carry on because deep down, very few people can claim their jobs have a hand in reducing suffering, yet unlike doctors I would never have to do a digital rectal examination in my entire professional life. Suffice it to say, this works out well so far because I ,incidentally am also a germaphobia. What can I say to my junior? An understandable hunger for fees from potential students tempts the school to overpromise, like the out of practice prof who out of greed or sentimentality, sometimes imply that all of their pharmacy students could one day produce worthwhile career, rather than frankly acknowledging the troubling truth, that to achieve great positions is an anomalous event. Indeed, virtually everything the student believes to be true, because their teacher has told them so, turns out to be the exact opposite. Beware, for experience might just be the cloak worn by charlatans and humbugs.For the rest of history, for the most of us, our bright promise will always fall short; it will hardly earn us bountiful sums of money or beget us extraordinary fame. Resilience, Diligence and Intelligence are needed to redraw the map of our reality, which we ourselves must find the path.#nuspharmacy-#96855: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96855","['Like: 162 people', 'Care: 22 people', 'Love: 11 people']",16 Comments,31 Shares
96849,"Hi guys! Can I ask you for your advice on how to deal with terrible neighbours? There is an 50 yr+ Indian uncle downstairs who has tried to blackmail us 2 times. We called the police but only reports have been made. We still have to deal with the guy. Background of this terrible neighbour:- He blasts 70s music loud until 1st floor (he lives on 10th) many times. Neighbours complain about him and it is in the police report.- He is alcoholic and often showed up in the lift with alcohol smells. - He has thrown things down from the windows (left-over food, rubbish etc.) One time it was a monitor. Thankfully there was a balcony at 8th floor. No one gets hurt so far. Neighbours complain about him and it is in the police report.- He often makes stories up and complains about other people. He reported a few to police. None of those stories were true. - He blackmailed my parents last year. He said the clothes they hanged were too wet that the water dripped to his phone and spoiled it. He asked for S$50. I wasn't at home. My poor parents were confused and gave in so that he won't continue to give trouble.Today he banged on the door again and said I made noise on the floor and he couldn't sleep. But I was napping in bed. So I politely asked him to leave. He refused and started to shout. And he started to ask if I am alone at home (I am a female) and ask me to open the door. He also tore the decoration on my door. I called the police and put the police on speaker mode. He got scared and threatened me he would come back. Then he quickly left my door. After 10 min, 2 police officers showed up and I explained everything to them. They went to the uncle's house to look for him. No one answered the door. Again, police made reports and left. I am thankful for the quick response of the police. Yet reality hits me that this uncle is still wondering around my neighbourhood. I believe that majority of our society is nice and kind. But it always has a few individuals that put us at risk. How do I protect myself before something bad happens as a small-size female? He dare to destroy the decoration on my door in front of my face. I am not sure when I am not around what other crazy stuff he can do. He knows my face too. I am scared to move around my neighbourhood alone now.My sincere gratitude.-#96849: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96849","['Angry: 34 people', 'Like: 33 people', 'Care: 6 people']",56 Comments,8 Shares

I would love to get to know her better but I don't know how to approach this matter since it has been a long time when we last had a conversation.

It is with much regret that all his effort for previous test has gone to waste because 5% of the class choose to CHEAT on a LEVEL ONE module that was proctored. Dr Lee is offering the students who cheated a chance to own up for more lenient punishment, while those who choose not to own up (but are already discovered) who be brought up to the Dean and higher management for further punishment. I strongly believe that all the students involved should face similar punishment like those of the CS (https://www.straitstimes.com/.../coronavirus-nus-students...).

I did ask her why didn't she say no or get out of that place but she said she did, but he was forceful and did whatever he wanted. All she thought was to ""let this be over with so I can get out"". After he was done she hurriedly tried to clean it off, got dressed up and left. This was around 4 years ago.I was sharing my experience too when I was pulled to an isolated staircase with a random uncle as a kid... He also did unspeakable things to me and I didn't know what was happening until I grew up and realised. I felt very humiliated and ashamed of myself. This was around a decade ago.What I wanted to ask was is it still possible for either of us to make a report? I don't really want anything to happen but I just feel like some closure would be good for her especially.

96822,"Some people are so “nice”. They are always willing to do all the nice things for you although you didn’t ask them to do all those for you. But strangely, when you’re unable to fulfil their expectations, they will say that they are disappointed in you. A nice person won’t tell everyone about the things they have done for you. A nice person do things quietly and do not expect you to return the favour. A nice person will not tell everyone what they have done for you and then complain about how you disappoint them if you’re not as nice as them. Just because someone is nice to you, it doesn’t give them the right to demand something from you. If you can’t meet their expectations, it’s not your problem. It’s their problem for having expectations. Do not let someone guilt-trip you into changing yourself to meet their expectations. Be thankful and appreciate what they have done for you and that’s good enough. If you want to do nice things for them, good for you. If you don’t want to, that’s fine too. Some people do nice things for you, not because they want you to be happy but because they want something in return. What do they want? Compliance, obedience, control, power? Or they just want to portray a good image? Or they think being nice is an obligation or responsibility? Or they do not want to look like they are selfish humans? Some people are nice to you, not because of you, but because of themselves. Yet they think the problem is YOU when you are not as nice as them. They say you are a selfish person when you say ‘no’ to them. They say you are selfish when you cannot return the favour. They say you are selfish if you do not care about them as much as they care about you. They blame you for being ungrateful. They blame you for their disappointment when in the first place, they were the ones who willingly chose to be nice. What is a nice person?A nice person gives without asking anything in return. A nice person cares for you and does not calculate how much you care for them in return. A nice person will not set expectations and get angry when you don’t meet them. A nice person will not do anything that would hurt you and would genuinely apologise if they have unintentionally hurt you. A nice person listens to you patiently instead of constantly talking about themselves all the time. A nice person respects you, your feelings and your personality. They do not claim that your feelings are not valid and they do not ask you to change your personality.A nice person does not expect you to be as nice as them. They only hope that you would treat them with basic respect. If they are upset at you due to your lack of respect, they will gently tell you about their feelings instead of blaming you for their feelings. To have a nice person as a family, friend or partner is a privilege. If you have them in your life, please cherish them and do not mistake their kindness for weakness. Please don’t ever disrespect them. Don’t blame them if they can’t meet your expectations. They are just humans who are fighting their own battles. Even if you think their battles are insignificant, it doesn’t mean they are not struggling. And it doesn’t mean they have the capacity to fulfil your expectations. Being nice is not an obligation. Being nice is a choice and it takes alot of effort to be nice to people. If someone is genuinely nice to you without expectations, please appreciate them.Thank you KY & YT for being the nicest humans I have ever known. Thank you for always being there for me, listening to me for hours when I feel down, reassuring me when other people try to make me feel inferior, doing all these nice things for me without expecting anything in return. I’m not a good listener like the both of you yet you all have never expected me to be a good listener. I’m not as nice as the both of you but you all have never expected me to be as nice. You all have done so much for me, without complaints, without judgement, without asking me to change my selfish behaviour. Just quietly being there for me, listening to my problems, supporting me in whatever I do, and doing all the nice things for me without asking me to do the same for you all. I don’t even know what I have done to deserve you all. I only know I’m the luckiest person on earth because you two are in my life.-#96822: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96822","['Like: 62 people', 'Care: 9 people']",12 Comments,24 Shares
96815,"How do people deal with it if their partner's personality changes, sometimes not for the better? I'd share the stories of my past 2 rs and would like to ask for advice on how to handle any future rs.Girl A, 2 year+ rs. She was a cheerful, happy-go-lucky girl. About a year into our rs, a close aunt of her unexpectedly passed away from cancer. From that point on, she gradually became depressed and lose her cheerfulness. At first, I was there for her, hearing her out and hope that her wounds would heal with time. However, as time passed, it looked like it was more difficult than first thought. She became more and more pessimistic about things in general. Our dates often are sombre and she would say something pessimistic or sad about virtually any topic we talk about. She couldn't laugh anymore. Despite professional help, her condition didn't really improve much. At that time, I was also having some personal issues on top of my stressful school work and these just add on to my worries. I realized that it was affecting my mental health as well and dragging me down and decided to end the rs once and for all. Girl B, 2 year rs. What attracted me to her was her simple down to earth and thrifty nature. We met when I was in my 3rd year and she was in her 4th. A few months after we got together, she graduated and went into the working world. However, over time she became influenced by her colleagues and the work environment and became more materialistic. She would start buying branded bags, makeup and clothes which she never did before. She was not satisfied with the simple pleasures of life anymore. We used to eat at food courts and hawker centres but she started asking me to go and eat those pricier food. I talked to her twice and while she did change her behaviour, it was only temporary and she would slowly go back to her usual pattern. Her work environment was stressful and being affected by the stress, she became a lot more moody and would throw her temper at the slightest things. I saw that she was no longer the person I knew and also fearing for my finances if I settle down with her, I ended things as well.When people first got together, each person is often attracted to some qualities of the other. However, as we know people can change over time. The person may not be the same 1 year, 5 years or 20 years later. I am afraid that if I go into the next rs, I may bail out again once the person's personality changes and affects me negatively and the cycle will repeat. I hope anyone can advise me how to handle such issues in a long term rs or is bailing out the only option?-#96815: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96815","['Like: 37 people', 'Haha: 9 people', 'Sad: 7 people']",83 Comments,9 Shares

This wasn't the only relationship you destroyed, but one of the many others too. Have you not felt a single guilt or even a morsel of remorse with all the carnage you left behind? Aren't you ashamed of all the emotional wreckage you bring to everyone you claimed you love or called them your friend? How much lower are you going to stoop?All i can say to you is you have done enough emotional damage to people. Quit going back to your ex lovers with all your problems and expecting them to solve them for you by manipulating them. You have emotionally abused too many people at this point and even sent some down the path of depression. Maybe i am being too harsh on you, but i believe someone needs to call you out on your shit. Telling you directly (multiple times) about your toxic behaviours doesn't seem to stop you from doing them, shall leave it out to the society to teach you the proper ways. Making people constantly think they are worthless by taunting them that you don't want or need them anymore, telling them that you'll leave and ditch them. People aren't toys for you to pick up when you need them and throw aside when they are done helping with your issues. Taking advantage of people's trust and goodwill to satisfy your own needs with your constant lies and manipulation - you really went too far. You are a serial cheater and you do need to seek professional help. Every feeling or emotion that comes your way is valid, it is your right to feel and think a certain way. but what actions you take for those feelings/emotions is your responsibility.Every action has its own consequences, what goes around comes around.To date, you can consider yourself lucky that karma hasn't hit you back with everything you've done. You aren't a christian yourself, but heed this - Proverbs 6:32I sincerely hope that you are aware and come to realise the full impact of your own actions and the toxicity you bring about to people. I hope that you aren't repeating history with your current boyfriend, because nobody deserves or needs to deal with mind games and emotional abuse. I hope you will gain the balls to sincerely apologize to the people you've hurt so badly. Now, thinking back on everything I have done for you, I have decided that you are not worth my time staying up till dawn for. I am done dealing with such a toxic character.

96791,"Is it hypocritical for climate change activist to have children? The average lifetime carbon footprint of a single person is around 20 metric tonnes. Since having children is always a choice, especially since abortions are legal in Singapore, you will contribute 20 metric tonnes of carbon each time you decide to bring a new life onto the earth. The whole basis of environmentalism, the biggest reason why we do it, is to preserve the habitability of the earth for future generations. Yet, in deciding to create future generations of people, we also choose to contribute substantially to global carbon emissions. It is ultimately a little bit disingenuous to say that on one hand I care about environmental degradation, but on another hand I want to make a decision that will evidently cause continual harm to the environment, long after I am dead. I think we can all be a little more ethically consistent. If we're supporting environmentalism for the sake of the earth and animals, then we should stop making humans because humans are the problem. If we want to continue to make more humans, then we should accept that environmental degradation is an unavoidable byproduct due to the Tragedy of the Commons, and any behavioral modification on the scale of 7 billion people is either going to be an insurmountable challenge, or too late to bring about any significant change in our climate trajectory.-#96791: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96791","['Like: 61 people', 'Haha: 33 people']",65 Comments,8 Shares

96784,"A few weeks ago I found out from my close friend that my gf was on a dating app. He even showed me her profile, and according to her profile description and photos, that profile seems legit and doesn't seem like a catfish. Not saying that my gf is ugly or what, but at least I know she doesn't have the look that people might want to use to impersonate. TBH I'm quite devastated when I saw that, cos we've been together for 3 years plus, and even planned when to BTO, so I decided to confront her to find out the truth and whether she is cheating on me. During the confrontation, she told me that she was just tempted to play with dating apps since her friends around her are happily meeting guys and girls through the app, but she has no intention to meet or talk to the guys that matched her. She said she only used them for a few days just for fun, see how the guys on dating apps look like, and partly due to curiosity as well, but she has already deleted the apps. Despite her assurance and explanation, I've been bothered by this situation for a few weeks, and I'm very tempted to see who she matched with and what she talked to those guys about. Is this considered a breach of her privacy? I don't usually check her phone or see what she chats with her male friends about, but right now I really have the urge to see her conversations with those guys, am I right for doing so?-#96784: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96784","['Like: 58 people', 'Sad: 17 people', 'Haha: 8 people']",82 Comments,13 Shares

96775,"Hello to the poster of #96745. I once faced the science vs arts dilemma back in JC. I took a more science and maths heavy combination in secondary school but was always much more inclined to studying the humanities and social sciences (in terms of interest and aptitude). But despite spending so much more time studying for my science and maths subjects, history and geography were my only A1s for my O-Levels.In the early weeks of JC I took a leap of faith and transferred from a Bio-Chem-Maths-Econ combi to a more humanities/social science-centric one. In retrospect it was one of the best decisions I ever made. In fact, if anything, I regret taking H2 rather than H1 math. I spent 65%-70% of my time studying for H2 math compared to my other subjects combined, and I have forgotten almost all the math I studied (although I still have a relatively decent understanding of the arts subjects I studied).In JC it is going to be even tougher. The students taking natural science subjects will generally be those who did well in those subjects for their O-levels (or the year 4 IP exams). And the same will be the case for uni. I am not discounting the possibility that hard work can turn things around, but you have to be aware that there will be students who will have a very high aptitude for the natural sciences who are willing to work as hard as you are (or even harder). Additionally, there are many courses at NUS that one can pursue if one’s strengths are in arts subjects such as those offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and Faculty of Law to name a few. I have seen far too many students choose a course in uni they lacked an interest in only to regret it afterwards (it can be a very long 3-4 years).You seem to be suggesting that you are more inclined to studying arts subjects. If so, you may wish to consider pursuing this route in JC. Studying something you enjoy and are good at is truly a double blessing. That being said, what subjects to pursue in JC is ultimately a choice only you can make for yourself and I wish you all the best in making your decision.-#96775: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96775",['Like: 16 people'],10 Comments,2 Shares

96763,"This was in last year, Aug. I was feeling quite lonely and decided to download Tinder to try my luck at chatting with someone. I didn't wanna use my real photos cos' I wanted to just have a random chat with someone superficially and not looking for anything else more than that. So I downloaded an average looking person's pic and put it as my display pic while all the personal information written were truly about the real me. You may go ahead to call me a ""catfish""... I guess? Anyway, in my attempt to randomly chat up with someone, I was matched with a pretty decent looking guy. We started off chatting quite comfortably as I was using the real me to communicate with him. I didn't wanna fake anything else except for my pic. To my surprise, we managed to chat on the app for over 5 hours straight because we clicked so well. It was just text after text. Our interests and hobbies were very similar and it felt like I knew him for years. However, the more I chat with him, the more I felt really bad and I had the urge confess to him that the picture he's seeing wasn't the real me. And I finally did. To prove the real me, I gave him my phone number and Instagram and kept apologising to him because I was really guilty about it. I believe he was quite shocked and disappointed too as it took him awhile to finally reply. In the end, he didn't wanna chat with me again on the account that I cheated his feelings. I mean... I really deserved it. I didn't expect that a supposed random ""superficial"" chat could turn out to become a true connection. Since then, I believe we both have moved on with our lives and I've learned my lesson to never use fake pics for whatever reasons again. Fast forward to today, I was trying to clear my phone contact list and found out that I still have his phone number and it turns out that he didn't block me on Telegram or WhatsApp. This got me to recall about the very comfortable and deep convos we had during that 5 hours on Tinder and also to spend some time crafting this confession to ask for opinions. I'm thinking of reconnecting with him, but I don't wish to upset him or gross him out again. Do you guys think that it's okay for me to drop him a message to ask him how's he? How should I start the first message? Or what should I do instead? I really wish to reconnect with him as it was a very rare encounter and I believe his friendship is one that I can treasure.-#96763: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96763","['Like: 27 people', 'Haha: 12 people', 'Care: 4 people']",39 Comments,3 Shares
96762,"Dating advice Just some bit of context of my life first - I went to NUS for half a sem, didn’t enjoy the course I was doing but couldn’t get into the course that I wanted (med) hence I ended up going to australia to pursue my passion. I’ve since graduated and have been working as a doctor for 5 years now, and I’m now 30 and still single, and have just moved back to Singapore.I’ve been trading big in the stock market (I made some pretty risky moves with my salary and savings - basically I went all or nothing) and with luck on my side, I made pretty big gains as well, and have cashed out earlier this year post the bull run around the time I’ve moved back to Singapore. I’ve indulged quite a little and bought a $12M house in a posh district as an investment, and I’ve also bought a brand new jaguar for me and my family to share. (I decided with my parents that we were going to stay in our old place - a 5 room HDB flat in the east which we have been occupying for 20 years now), and rent out my investment property for more income.Anyways to the dating side of things - My friend recommended I use a dating app to try and meet someone and it’s just led to nowhere.  And this is where I really need some genuine advice.Long story short, I’ve realized that when my profile depicts my occupation and a better glimpse of my nett worth, I get way way way more interested girls (yes I’m a dude) than if I were to not. I discovered this when I made a profile in one dating app and another in a very similar dating app. In the first app I basically put in the very basics - eg a picture of me with friends, one with my family, me posing awkwardly with a selfie along ECP, my fav hawker meal, and I’ve just put down “lots of admin” under my job description as that was genuinely what I did, and my lifestyle. I then got about 5-6 matches (over the course of 4 weeks and probably hundreds of swipes later..) which apparently was not a lot but I didn’t know that since it was my first time using a dating app. The Conversations also died down really quickly. Anyway, my friend told me it was pathetic.Anyway, she then helped me remake my profile in the next dating app - which was extremely similar to the first one. I couldn’t redo my first profile as the swipes were permanent. Anyway this time round she set up my pictures of me with my new car (which I barely drive at all since my parents used it way more) and my new house (which I’m not technically even living in) and put down my occupation as “doctor”. I just laughed it off and left it as that. Oddly enough, I received likes in nearly 30% of my swipes (yes I swipe right to most people as I thought I didn’t stand a chance anyway) this time and got about 70 or so matches in 1 week. Within the next 2 months i had dates lined up nearly every day or two (which was pretty difficult given my work schedule). And to be honest I felt like I got along well with many of my dates - ie we were compatible? But I can’t help but be troubled by the fact that some of them potentially were not genuine with me? Reason why I thought so was because there were a couple of them that I remembered swiping right on in the first app, and I didn’t match with them? I thought it was a coincidence initially - eg maybe they didn’t see my profile, but then I started recalling more and more profiles from the first app I never matched with after swiping right. There was also one date who asked if she could come back to my place, which I said no to since my parents wouldn’t like it, but I caved in on the second date and brought her home, and she was a bit off and wanted to leave early from my flat. Basically it started going downhill after she asked about the house I took a picture with in my DP and I just told her that I don’t live there and laughed it off. Another date also totally bombed when I showed up after toking a bus there.My question is this, what should I do?! I did not stand a chance with anyone from my first profile and I did with my second but i am now feeling that it wasn’t who I am that attracts these girls. I am really lonely and want a companion and potentially future wife - which I can’t get at all from my first profile since I can’t even strike a date, but on my second profile it’s the flip side, where there are heaps of girls who are interested but I do not know if they’re genuine. I would want to know for sure that the other party is genuine before progressing any further in a relationship and marriage.. any advice would be greatly appreciated.

96708,"I've known my spouse for about 10 years now and married for 4, going 5. No kids, and we are both professionals with full time careers. Seems like the perfect couple, but only we are not.My world came crushing down couple of weeks ago when I found out about an emotional affair, apparently over the last few months or more.I should have seen it coming, the change in behaviour, the mood swings, the secrecy in texting, the sudden bursts of gifts (to me). To the effect that I've expressed concern about our marriage and this friend, to which the replies were, ""I can very happy and contented with our marriage, why do you keep over thinking and complicating things?"" or ""it's just a platonic friendship why can't you give me the freedom to have friends outside of our marriage?""I respected that, and gave both of us the benefit of doubt. Until one faithful weekend. Again secretly texting the other party right while sitting beside me and our friends, sending photos and smiling at the phone. I lost it and went to snoop further the next day (I know this is wrong but I just couldn't take it anymore). One can imagine the rage, anger, despair, fear, disappointment, hopelessness when I found out about it all. And no doubt there were screams and tears, endless tears till now, and I am still feeling like an empty shell. It felt like I'm the third party breaking up a pair of perfectly in love couple. It felt like I've been living in my own little bubble of lies. It felt like all the joke's on me. I asked if they have thought of divorcing their respective spouses to get together, I asked if they were truly in love, and I was only met with silence. And this silence speaks louder than words, and felt like a sharp blade stabbing at me, repeatedly. Yet my other half proclaimed to be really sorry and regretful for all the hurt imposed on me and was willing to end it and refocus on us. I might be an overthinker, but I also don't want to go down without a fight. Even if it does end up with the inevitable, I want to be honest with myself that I've given my all to try and make it work. A no regret move, I suppose. If anything, I realise I still love my other half deeply, but the pain on some days are just so hard to bear. The triggers, the behaviours, the associations... How long more can I take this? Some days when I look out the window I'd think maybe if I just jump down, all my problems and pain will be gone, and they can be together and be truly happy. But then I think of my parents and those who care for me, I realise that's a very selfish move. But who else can I turn to? I can't tell my family or friends, because that's an immediate marriage suicide. I can't keep talking about the pain I'm feeling else I'll be the nagging spouse only to push them closer together. I came across some marriage vows the other day, ""... in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others keep thee only unto her/him as long as you both shall live?""Am I the only hopelessly naive individual to think that people still enter a monogamous marriage willingly, and has the discipline to stay true to the other party? Or has the times changed so much that marriage is no longer sacred and we ought to be more chillax and frivolous, because, YOLO, ya-know.. I need help. I need assurance. And I need hope that everything will be alright. But who else can I turn to? When can I find peace and see the light?-#96708: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96708","['Care: 147 people', 'Like: 95 people', 'Sad: 95 people']",86 Comments,38 Shares

96694,"I got pregnant and was forced to marry a guy who is a cheater as well as a gambler with tons of debts, or choose to get disowned by my family. He has been jobless for months and tried to scam my parents money previously using sympathy and out of my parents love for me. My love and respect for this man has died ever since.I have more savings compared to people my age group, as I am someone who is frugal and works hard in life, the only mistake I did in life is to not open my eyes big enough and fell for the wrong guy, but I do not regret getting pregnant as I have always wanted a child. Initially, my plan was to wait and see how this man would value-add to my life, change or contribute towards helping to raise the kid as the stigma of being a single mother is still there, but as time passes, this man whom I once loved has been jobless for almost a year and haven’t really been trying hard to find a job nor contribute in any way. All he does is play games, gamble online, don’t even bother to return his loans to me or my family, and watch Netflix all day.It seems like even though I’m pregnant and giving birth, he does not seem to worry that he has to work harder to contribute to the family, he can’t even feed himself, and expects me to pay for all the expenses just because I have savings. And whenever he finds me, he expects me to have sex with him and pleasure him even though I’m close to giving birth.I have read a lot of nus whisperer stories that say that singaporean girls are materialistic and go for guys with good prospects and income, whereas foreign girls do not. However, I would beg to differ. All girls would love to be doted and taken care of by their husband, which girl wouldn’t? But in this case if the man doesn’t step up, until which point should a foolish wife continue to stay with him despite his disloyalty, debts and attitude, I don’t think any foreign girls would be foolish enough still to stick around, and I definitely do not want to have to work harder in future to feed an extra mouth just because I was forced into this situation.-#96694: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96694","['Like: 89 people', 'Care: 55 people', 'Sad: 39 people']",65 Comments,16 Shares

96692,"What can you do when your parent is experiencing a mid-life crisis and you're too ""young"" to comment on his behaviour? I come from a loving, middle-class, dual-income family. In our younger days, my Father contributed more money compared to my Mother as he was still doing all right in his business (he was self-employed then). We could afford annual holidays and generally, we seem ""alright financially"". When I reached my teens, my Father's business was dwindling and subsequently ended when things were gradually not profitable. My Mother is the kind of person where she does not poke into my Father's business, so when business shut for many months, my Father assumed the role of unemployed man while my mother brought home more income. When I reached university age, under the encouragement of us that maybe he could learn practical skills of geomancy to integrate with his construction/ interior design business, his mind was set on fire to learn and make a living out of it. He invested some money. However, it appeared more like he did this in the heat of the moment. This interest did not sustain, and again he was in search of a job. He didn't like to work for others, or even companies of his original industry. He searched jobs that paid 1/5th of the kind of salary which he took home comfortably when we were in our younger days, even jobs that were 'low skilled' and could stay in it for about ten months. For the jobs in his 'specialty' he often quit in less than two months as I believe he was unable to take the pressures of the industry. Generally speaking, he often thinks that he is very smart/ smarter than Mother. Mother expresses to me some resentment towards his lack of effort to provide for the family but she seems to be able to just sigh about it as she ""can't change Father"". As a child, I could sense that Father has a huge pride. He doesn't share his work struggles with the family very much as he thinks that we do not know what he is going through, thinks that we are ""nagging"" at him. I believe that neither does he share ""constructive conversations"" with his friends. What I could identify is that he does not want to recognise his weaknesses or calmly assess his shortcomings and failures + change his mindset for growth. I don't know if I would articulate this well, but Father doesn't face up to criticisms and problems well and would quit when he ""can't take it"". I don't know what I can do as a concerned child seeing my Father struggle. I'm worried that my parents may divorce. I don't like seeing my dad being unresilient and not being able to face rejections and quitting easily at a sign of difficulty.

96684,"My family wasnt always rich, we grew up normal. Then, my dads business became successful when i was in primary school.My parents grew up poor so now that we r financially stable, they would spend on things they never got to enjoy when they were younger. I just dont agree with my dads obsession with cars. He ever told me that he never had a chance to get in a car when he was young as his parents couldnt afford it (not even a taxi ride). This may be the cause of his obession. Initially he bought 2 cars, one for my mom n one for him. When my sister got her license, he bought another car for her. Doesnt really make sense as my mom doesnt drive often so my sister could have shared it. When i got my license he bought another car using the reason that the first car has only about a year left. Now my younger sister is taking her license n instead of discouraging him to buy another car, she is encouraging him as she wants this specific car model. Obv he got excited as someone in this family is into cars as well n most likely will buy her that car once she gets her license. Also he loves antique cars n has 2 of them stored in Malaysia. Am i overreacting or is this getting out of hand?  Btw the first car has been scrapped n the second one has less than year left, hopefully he doesnt buy any new cars after this.

96678,"What's the quickest and cheapest way for someone in their mid-40s with around S$100 million in illiquid yield-generating assets to get a Singapore citizenship for retirement in Singapore? My wife's uncle is a Malaysian and he has nearly S$100 mil in real estate, earning roughly S$5 mil a year on rent alone. He is single, without children, and he wants to move to Singapore because he thinks the infrastructure in Malaysia is not suitable for retirement. He has never worked a job. He started a distribution company in his early 30s, which he sold many years back, after which he used the money to fund his purchase of a commercial office building in KL, worth around 330-350 million MYR. He has a first in land economy from Cambridge (unlikely to matter), and two masters from MIT. Ultimately he wishes to liquidate his assets in Malaysia, in exchange for some yield-generating Singapore properties, but he intends to spend every single cent before he dies.

96673,"My dad is very conservatively Chinese and he has already passed on his entire asset portfolio (shares of an investment company) to my elder brother, who is 30 this year. I’m a girl and my dad has told me categorically that I will get nothing. Not that I feel I am entitled to receive anything, it’s ultimately their choice. But I just don’t like what it is doing to my brother. My brother is now a 100% owner in an investment company with a passive revenue of a little more than $2 mil with an extremely high margin. As far as I know, the business requires very little effort to run. My dad has been doing it for years and it doesn’t seem like he’d been working. My brother has quit his day job as a management consultant at an MBB company a year ago, and has since been doing nothing at home. It can’t bear the sight of watching him waste his life away.I’ve always admired my brother, who is 5 years older than I am. He went to RI/RJC, and then he graduated summa cum laude from UPenn. He had always wanted to become a professor but decided against that life the minute he inherited my dad’s business. I had always imagined he’d go on to do great things with his life, but now he has no life. My brother is also the extremely frugal type. He probably takes after my dad. He still lives with them in my parents’ 3-bedroom HDB. He spends very little on things and eats out at hawker centers on most days, dolled up in his secondary school PE shorts and army singlet. He hasn’t had a girlfriend, he doesn’t go out with friends, the last I asked him he told me he doesn’t want to date or to be married. He has always been a massive loner with very few interests, so it’s just really sad to see how boring his life is. Since he took over the company, he has given me 200K every year. I appreciate it very much because he has always doted on me. But I just wish he had someone or something who could give his life meaning. My best friend, Sara, has been close to my family for years, since we were in P1. She recently showed a bit of interest in my brother, since he is really kind, really loving, really loyal, really smart. The only problem is she’s very outgoing and my brother is honestly just very boring. The way I see it, I don’t think it will work out but she says she needs the stability in her life. Is it advisable for me to set her up with my bro, knowing that she’s probably going to end up very frustrated with my brother’s lack of desire to do anything? I also wouldn’t want to make things difficult for my brother if he really enjoys his reclusive lifestyle.

96663,"Am I an asshole for scolding my bf for selling investment plans to my parents?So my bf has been an insurance agent/financial planner before we even got together, and I'm supportive of his career choice. We've been together for slightly over a year and we've met each other's parents a couple of times already. Still, he has only met my parents about 5 times since we only meet up as a family for gatherings like someone's birthday or CNY.My bf had told me that he wanted to sell insurance/investment plans to my parents and I said no, because I didn't want my parents to think badly of him. You know, the stigma around insurance agents/financial planners. Then, I just found out that he sold an investment plan to my parents. He waited for me to leave the house to settle some errands and then talked my parents into buying the plan.Thing is, the plan looks absolutely horrible. My parents have to pay 50k a year for 5 years. They will then get a lump sump back at the end of the 5 years with interest. My parents are retired, and they have about 300k in cash savings. This means they have to set aside 250k in their bank to pay for these 5 years, which means this plan is locking their retirement money which could be put in some other investment plans/stocks. This also means that they only have 50k to spend for the next 5 years which I think is definitely not enough. I feel like this plan is more suited for people who are still drawing an income and can set aside 50k a year to save, and not for people with the actual cash in hand now in retirement. If anything, they should be buying a plan that dumps 250k in now, then withdrawing X amount a year instead.Now my parents are quite happy with the plan, saying that it has a good interest and all, and my bf is happy that he earned the commission and has somewhat gained respect from my parents as a financial planner. My parents are really not financially literate and the money they have now is from their lifetime of saving. They do not have much cpf because they were self employed (small provision shop). I have not told my parents how stupid this plan is because I'm afraid they'd start to hate my bf or they'd just not trust me, but I feel like it is my duty to protect my parents' interest. Also, they are very stubborn and I feel like I will not be able to convince them to cancel the plan.There's still time to cancel the plan without any fees but I'm in a real dillema now... My bf is disagreeing that this plan is stupid, and he said my parents have the right to invest in whatever they want without my approval, and he emphasized that they are happy with it. What should I do?

96649,"Just a few thoughts that I have. A disclaimer: They definitely won't apply to everybody but these are just some of my feelings!  Sometimes I feel that life is essentially made up of challenges, obstacles, and situations that help to determine my role within it. These past couple years, while I keep on trying to find a certain type of happiness within life, I keep encountering situations that seem to suggest to me otherwise, that the time has not come for me to attain that yet. I really cherish the friendships that I have forged over the years and I will always remain grateful for them  Now, after all this time, I feel that my path has been becoming clearer and clearer: To help my friends attain the happiness that they deserve and to always be happy and there for them once that have achieved it. Even though I can't seem to possess what they have, I should and always remain by their side and help them to greater heights while I hide my present emotions. As each day passes, this role gets clearer and clearer. Deep down in my heart, I still hope that one day, I will be able to experience what they had. Then maybe, my role in life will be changed to a different one! So sorry if this sounds so weird haha. Thanks for listening and have a safe and great day yall!

There were quite a number of new hires before me (fresh grads), hence many projects and other work have already been given to them. When I joined, I feel like I’ve just been given ad hoc work to do. I have spoken to my supervisor two times to voice my concerns, and I was told not to worry that I don’t have any big projects on hand now, and was asked to read up on more research. I feel quite useless because of this, and I feel sad that I am quite free (I know it’s weird that I’m actually complaining that I am stressed over not having enough work to do when others are stressed with too much work to do). I am naturally someone who likes to keep myself busy and I would prefer to be stressed over being busy than stressed over being too free.

96642,"Pardon me, i really just need to rant and let it out somewhere.I've been in a vicious cycle. I'm a very introverted person, a homebody, and someone who has a superrr small social circle. Heck, i dont even talk to these friends very often as they're all living their own lives and are at a different phase from me. Because of this, I often feel lonely and want to have someone to talk to. Everytime i make a new friend (mostly from online, we havent even met irl), we chat a lot at the beginning, maybe the first few days, sometimes 1-2weeks. During this period of chatting, I feel really happy because we get along well and i want this newly formed friendship to last a long time. However, I get emotionally attached super easily and will start to feel sad when i realise that we are running out of things to talk about. I understand that it is natural and friends do not need to talk every single day, but it just doesnt feel good. With my type of personality, I always end up thinking that the person has lost interest in me and i'm going to lose another friend and feel empty all over again. (Clingy/needy af, i know)I try my best to carry the conversation, ask questions, share about myself, send links to new food places, dog videos, funny memes etc. Even if we both expressed that we want to maintain this friendship, slowly i can see the other party's replies getting shorter and responses are no longer like before. I get tired of being the only one putting in the effort, eventually the convo died and i lost another friend.Now, i'm back to feeling empty and alone because after a period of daily chatting, i got no one to talk to again. And then this whole vicious cycle continues...I'm drained from this whole shit but idk what to do...

We were introduced by my ex bf who’s his friend, and got closer cuz we went to the same poly and spent a lot of time together. I don’t know whether he ever had romantic feelings for me back, cuz he admits he treats me specially (delivering free bubble tea to my work & home, sending me home, picking me up after drinking etc). He also introduced me to his parents & some of his close friends to try to help me open up & meet new ppl. When I talked to his friends, most of them tell me they suspect he has feelings for me but he won’t admit cuz of the special way he only treats me and shares his secrets with me. He also still brings me to his meetups with friends and work gatherings, we support each other emotionally and go out a lot though he is busy with work.While he rejected me a few years back when I confessed to him, we both stayed single since then. I’ve tried going on dating apps but it never worked out cuz I know I still have feelings for him. I think he’s tried dating too but he says he has no time & interest now cuz of his job. He claims he sees me as a younger sister that’s why we’re so close and he takes care of me. We both don’t talk about romance tho we’re very comfortable with each other and can talk abt anything else having long convos every day.

Next, she accused me of having no consent aka sexual assault. I tried to explain and apologise but she would not hear any of it. In the end, I dropped her off at her house. She did not respond to my calls nor messages after a day and eventually said not to meet up anymore (breakup). I accepted it and moved on albeit heartbroken and flabbergasted.A few days later, she texted me asking me to meet up and I asked for what purpose but she said nvm and blocked me on every online platform. Today, a friend of my ex accused me of having no consent and is blaming me for sexual assault. It has taken a toll on my mental health and has made me extremely fearful of having another relationship.

However, some part of me wonders if that’s enough. I had an interest in the past who I had a unique connection with, where we were always in sync and could connect over anything and everything. Other than just sharing very similar life values, we had very similar thought processes and worldviews which made it easy for him to understand the life trajectory I’m on and why I make certain choices in life. While it’s not like I want to return to this past interest, I just wonder what is enough in a long term relationship. Often, I see people say that love (feelings) is not enough if there is no effort. What if the effort is there but we are just not fundamentally in sync? For eg, maybe sharing about some things, I know he will support me and encourage me but he does not share the same thoughts and may not understand why I choose to do certain things. I want the r/s to work and I’m grateful to have such a good person in life - and that’s why I want to be sure that this will not become an issue in the future, or perhaps I’m just looking for some wise words to dissuade me from constantly thinking about that one sync connection that I know a part of me craves.

We’ve been together for almost 4 years, just a few months before we hit our 4th anniversary, but he decided to end things with me because of this fxxking covid-19 issue.Ever since we are allowed to hangout and dine-out after 2 months of lockdown last year, things began to change. He hates hangout out and waiting for long queues. Because all eateries have to practise safe social distancing, so restaurant, cafes, and even hawker centres and foodcourts can’t accommodate full house dining, so like 50% of the tables are empty, therefore people have to queue outside. Just imagine popular places like ding tai fung already have long queue before covid-19, now it’s just getting worse. My ex has very bad patience, so whenever we hung out, he got very frustrated whenever we had to queue, and there were many times we ended up eating at less popular eateries that we don’t even like. Even at foodcourts also we had a hard time finding a table. It’s like everywhere we go, be it shopping mall or restaurants outside, there will always be a queue, so he just got sick of waiting.My ex is quite fit, I would say he is a gym junkie who workout 5-6 days a week. Even on days when I just want to chill and rest at home, he would go to the gym too since we can’t meet. Although he is muscular, he also does cardio activities like cycling, HIIT and jogging. But he dislikes wearing a mask because it gives him breathing difficulty. I know this sounds ridiculous because my friends and I who don’t even gym or exercise have no problem hanging out with mask on, but when I saw him sweating so much, face turning red, and gasping for air when we hung out, I feel guilty for hanging out with him. He told me that he doesn’t like to hangout anymore because wearing mask just makes him difficult to breathe. Even after trying different masks, it’s still the same, he doesn’t seem to be able to breathe normally. Another problem is when he gets hot and stuffy, his mood would turn bad too, so those happy meet-ups actually turned out to be moody and sad.As he can no longer accept this kind of dating lifestyle, he initiated to breakup with me. He said given this fxxked up covid-19 situation, all he wants is just to stay at home and just takeaway simple food nearby his place during weekend. I’m actually fine with it too because I know this is not gonna be permanent, but he feels that this so-called new normal is not going to end anytime soon, and we are expected to be masked on for at least a few years, so he doesn’t want to waste my time.Enough of ranting, I just hope you guys can give me some advice on how I should approach him because I really want to patch back and be with him again.

96594,"Rant post here: Having been married with my wife for more than 7 years, had two kids, our precovid years prior were more or less happy and satisfactory although not entirely smooth sailing. Due to covid and issues at her workplace, my wife quit her job and she starts to have doubts in the marriage. Minus off all the details and complicated stuffs, we decided to go open relationship to maybe bring some sparks and life to our own lives and marriage as well. The bottom line is even if we have puppy love with outside lovers, the spouse and family comes first. She initiated this arrangement with video chat with others first, then into irl meet ups. Of course I wasn't initially happy with this arrangement but she wasn't feeling happy no matter what and I thought by doing this she would be happy. How I've erred. The current bf she's with initially I've met with him as well and I was OK with how she described him as a person with a sense of justice and positivity. I've should have known a person who's willing to sleep with others wife even if she's in an open relationship wouldn't have these traits. Before long, he started to ask her to divorce me, even though he doesn't like kids, he's willing to take care. He even mentioned to her he's willing to sell of his assets to take care of them. It was also after that my wife found out he's inheriting tens of millions from his deceased stepfather.During the whole process my wife's hinted that she had fallen in love with him, and it was never about the money. Then came the most selfish and heartbreaking moment I've experienced in my life. On the day of my birthday, she told me she had wanted to arrange for some nice starvation event for us but since I've arranged already she never went through(she never even mentioned it before aNyway till that day). Then she told me she wanted to divorce amicably.... I was devastated, who in the right mind would say such things on a person's birthday. After we talked it out, she says she will head to the bf side to talk things out and try to break it off. In the end, she only went back to our room late in the morning.... With love bites all over her body that she purposefully asked her bf to plant... And suddenly the entire marriage there wasn't anything I did right and all the things she did was not wrongIn the end, I told her if she want to divorce, she can pack her bags and leave the house immediately. I will also cease all the money that I give her and pays for her. Yup, during this whole time she was also using the money I gave her while unemployed to go out with her bf. After a series talks, we agreed to break off any arrangements we have outside of marriage after a month. In this month I wouldn't care about what she does. But... The betrayal and the hints that she gave... Makes me doubtful she will entirely break off, even if she really does breaks off, if it's just me who wants to fix out marriage but she doesn't want to put in the effort to fix our marriage, I do not see the future as being happy. Now I'm at a dilemma to whether to divorce and fight for the care and control of my kids, or try to trust her and fix the marriage. I do have some friends who advice just let the judge decide and if she takes the care and control, let her n her bf take care while I go free and single. But for me my main concern is I want my children to have a whole loving family that neither of us have (she says her bf family is really loving and is the kind she's looking for, unlike my family whose dysfunctional as compared to a normal family).-#96594: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96594","['Like: 14 people', 'Sad: 13 people', 'Wow: 5 people']",22 Comments,2 Shares

96584,"Advice needed!! Currently I'm in a 2-year master programme in urban planning, and studio work takes up a huge portion of the curriculum. There is this girl who always free rides and I've grouped with her for studio twice already. Last semester I accepted fate, but this semester I'm really angry that it's still group grading for this 8 mcs mod, and it's just super unfair to us. In the first few weeks of the semester, when our studio group was having discussions, she always talked about useless things such as ""the other day I did something"", or she would only say ""ok"" or ""I tried but it's too hard to find what y'all want..."". Then these weeks she attended our group meetings, but she was there just to do other things!! She did her individual assignments, she was chatting with friends, she was even shopping online... Then we cannot tolerate her anymore, so my friend went to talk to her, asked her if she could keep up and if she could contribute to our studio work. Still, she talked about some useless stuff, trying to make it our fault that we always agree with each other so she doesn't want to speak up (actually the rest of us argue against each other a lot on studio). Nothing has changed even after we talked to her.So we reached out to the TA for help, see if there's anything the tutors of the studio can do. Then we were told that this stupid studio is still group grading (but the tutors said it's indiv grading at the beginning). We asked for a peer evaluation for indiv grading, but the TA said the tutors think peer review is biased and they don't want it. I was like:????? Last sem was zoom lesson so I can understand indiv grading is quite hard as they can't really observe each person's contribution. Then this sem they meet us every week for a whole day, they still say it's difficult to observe? The whole class can tell the girl is free riding, but they can't???Our group has been doing quite good for the studio since the beginning, and I think our grade is not gonna be bad. It's just so unfair that the freeloader can share the grade as what we've been putting effort into, and she literally did NOTHING. I'm so angry now, and we tried everything we can do. The tutors are just lazy to deal with this thing. I didn't meet any professors and lecturers like this during my 4-year undergrad in NUS. Now I know the tutors in master programme in NUS are so irresponsible... We just want an individual grade that is fair to everyone................. What should I and my group do now? I want to email the programme director for this thing but I don't know if I should do it.... The final crit is in week 13 so I have to solve this issue asap.......-#96584: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96584","['Like: 17 people', 'Care: 3 people']",11 Comments,1 Share
96581,"Can a girl and guy really just be close friends and nothing else ?We’ve known each other for close to 3 years. We met through a mutual friend and have been hanging out since then. We do not meet every single week or rather, the frequency is pretty irregular, due to her studies and my commitments.We usually meet up for a meal to hang out and she would offer to drive around too. She had already caught my attention when I first met her which was the reason why we remained in contact after that first encounter. It was after texts and time spent together that got us knowing each other better. But I know she just treats me as a friend. Confessed to her once and.. yup u know what happened. Let’s just call my crush dinosaur. She would often asks me for advice as what she should do because she liked a particular guy. Sometimes I wished she was hinting that it’s me, but it’s not. Lol.After confession, things went back to normal and as if nothing happened. After that period I started hanging out with this colleague and things didn’t went really well. Meanwhile, Dinosaur and I at that period of time was rather quiet and didn’t hung out as much as before too. We were both busy with our own lives. But we were aware of what we were going on with. Eventually I broke things off with the girl.Honestly I really liked dinosaur but I knew both of us are kinda impossible. I had good impression of her, goods feelings but tried to not fall deep into it because I know both of us are likely going nowhere, judging from the questions she asked me before. To cover up the fact that I’ve gotten over her, ill often pop questions like ways to ask a girl out or whatever it is to cover up my feelings for her. I didn’t want things to turn awkward. There was once she asked in a rather timid manner about how are things going between me and the girl, and I just said it’s over. She gave me the impression that she’s wanting to try, maybe I’m thinking too much. When we hung out, i really felt we were a couple, except without holding of hands, lol.I know I’ve kinda screwed things up. But sometimes the questions she asks me makes me feel like I’ve a chance. We’ve been hanging out together, Idk if u would even call it a date. We are good now and idw to make things awkward if i were to pop any question to ask if we are really just close friends, or there’s a chance of becoming of than friends. Right now, I’m just staying by her side and always there for her.Rather annoyed, lost, and disappointed. What should i do? Are we really just friends?

96568,"Okay so i have been holding this for very long. So basically i met this girl through a friend and online game. Basically we were playing game everyday ever since we talked, and we can be in the same call for almost 10hours or more. So slowly i developed feelings for her and decided to just confess. Then slowly we became closer and closer and sometimes i will go to her house. Even though like it was quite far but i just went. So here's the thing. Last time when we just started talking she'll stay online to maybe text for 10-20 mins max. But now we when text, at most is 1-2 text then she'll go offline and reply maybe 5mins later. But now whenever i see that she is able to reply others instant but not me it just felt really depressing. And she told me that she don't reply instant but after those incident (still happening) idk what i should even feel about it. Now that we've gotten closer, and we started playing with our friends, most of the time she'll ask me to call them instead of like last time where the call will be just the two of us. We even spoke about jealously this matter and what i don't really like. I just don't know how to react to these situations.

We are both turning 28 this year. We share several common hobbies and are the sort of friends who could talk about anything under the sun without bounds but we are never romantically attracted to each other. We both love the independent and carefree lifestyle. However, he recently asked me if we want to get married at least in name. His parents have been asking him about settling down even though he doesn’t really want to. If we were to get ‘married’, we could have each other’s company and have someone to rely on in times of need. We would agree not to have any kids. Financially wise, he holds a high paying job and is from a rich background so he is okay to support me should I lose my job etc, which gives me some security. It is a special marriage where we could keep each other company when needed and yet can lead our own independence lives and free to go out, party with other friends etc without any question from the other party. According to him, we can also enjoy privileges such as getting a bto (if not each of us have to wait till 35), grants, reliefs etc for married people. I am very tempted to accept his proposal.

96537,"After 6 years working in public service, I feel stagnant and interest in my work has nosedived. I think many of my peers feel the same way and we wonder if we should make a career switch into the private sector. Especially with the hypergrowth of the tech industry, FOMO is real and we fear that this would be our last chance to try jumping out to the private sector, before age catches up in our thirties. While we are thankful to have a stable job, we also wonder if there is more to life than being a servant of the bureaucracy.I have seen many public servants toiling at the same job for decades. Many stay on because of the stability, but most of them have grown jaded and resentful, simply because the sense of stagnation has eaten away at them. To all those who have faced this crossroads before - should I take a gamble and make a switch now to the private sector, or should I just stick it out and find opportunities in the service? I have no debt and no kids at this point in time, so financially I have some leeway. However, moving also entails losing out on career progression in the service (simply by virtue of seniority). My interest is in tech and data analytics. While there is huge demand for this in the private sector, the competition is also intense and I worry about job prospects and stability. I have honed my skills through constant self-practice but I’m now at a stage where I find it hard to improve further without learning from the industry. The public service doesn’t seem to prioritise / offer as much opportunities for growth in these areas and I wonder if I will regret not pursuing my interest now.Would appreciate any advice plz  Prof Ben Leong, would love to hear your thoughts too!-#96537: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96537","['Like: 65 people', 'Care: 8 people']",47 Comments,3 Shares

I’m boring, I study a lot, though I do maintain a healthy lifestyle and exercise twice a week. Their relationships never lasted more than 6 months, and then they would come crying to me after, and whenever I thought I’d have a chance, the next fboy comes along and they leave again (note we didn’t officially get together, just that they would text me all the time for consolation, their problems what not, I’ll buy them meals to cheer them up, deliver them to their door at night when they wanted to) then the messages die down, and before I realize, they were already together with another fboy for a few weeks. I’d leave the toxic “friendship” and meet someone else and somehow the process repeats. I don’t know what to do anymore, and I don’t understand why these girls I’ve met have constantly chosen the obviously bad alternative and continue to do, even as they are near to their 30s too now.

A recent revelation from my parents got me feeling pretty shitty about myself.For context, my parents run a very small business but I never knew much about it. One day I was just curious to know how long their only employee has been working and her salary. Turns out that while her monthly salary is about 2+k/month since her highest qualification was just 'O' Levels, the amount of annual bonus my parents give to her is such that her monthly takeaway is actually equivalent to someone earning 4+k/month! In contrast, I am drawing out just 2.8k/month at my current job which I accepted out of desperation being unemployed after graduation for several months.I can't help but feel like a loser right now and plenty of regrets certainly came to mind. And before anyone starts asking, no. My parents won't take me into their business, nor do I intend to work for my parents because it is not something I can do and they intend to retire soon anyway.

Most of our dates involve chilling at each other’s houses, just quietly doing our own things. While I try my best to accommodate his preference of staying home, once in a while I feel a tinge of jealousy when I see my guy friends excitedly researching on nice places to take their gf to, planning and dressing up for special occasions etc.I did try to plan our dates before, but always met with reluctance from him. For example, when I tell him about food places I want to try, he coldly replies the food is most likely not nice and overpriced, and he prefers home cooked food. When I tell him about some events or classes I am interested in, he just brushes it off, or sometimes he claims he can’t go because he needs to stay home and do work. But in the end he just wastes the time away playing games / surfing the net, very frustrating tbh.FYI I don’t even suggest very expensive places to go to, don’t expect him to pay for everything although he earns a lot and can afford it, and also not very often (once a week). I am thinking perhaps doing things together outside our homes once in a while will help us de-stress and spice up our relationship. Also, honestly I’m very tired of cooking for him when we’re home, moreover he doesn’t help with the washing/cleaning after. We’ve been together for barely a year and I was thinking if it’ll get much worse once we’re married.Anyone been in similar situation?

96507,"To the OP of #96393:I was actually in a very similar position to you a while back. I was interested in a guy and decided to actively pursue him. he realised I was interested and told me that he wasn’t looking for a rs then, so I accepted that and we continued to hang out. things got very messy when clearly he was also interested in me but holding back from making things official because of certain concerns that we would not be compatible for the long term. I was definitely very hurt by his indecisiveness and unclear stance. it was only after many long talks (I brought up what I was feeling to him) that we decided to try things out (dating, though the way we were acting was like we were in a rs for a long time before we decided this). there were many many things to work out between us (resolved over the course of months, definitely with big ups and downs) but we’re together officially and in a pretty good place rn. I would suggest you really talk things out with him and explain your feelings (you don’t know his rationale for such actions either). if he makes it clear he’s not interested, it would be much easier on yourself to give clear boundaries on how you should act around each other eg. maybe give a longer break inbetween meeting up, keep physical contact at a minimum, only say things to him via text or irl that you would say to any regular guy friend. basically treat him exactly as you would any of your other guy friends, and make sure he treats you similar to how they (yr guy friends) would treat you. niceness is one thing but its not going to help in your situation. it does take time for your mindset to switch and it doesnt help at all when both parties actions make it fuzzy.finally, know that you certainly deserve someone willing to take a definite chance on you! and that you are strong enough to deal with whatever happens. good luck! -#96507: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96507","['Like: 18 people', 'Love: 1 person', 'Care: 1 person']",0 Comments,3 Shares
96505,"Dear #96393,Reading your confession and all the comments/advice that came with it was really helpful, and made me feel less alone. I think I found it really striking that there are so many similarities to what I've been going through - or maybe I just feel so desperate and alone that I'm drawing up links to whatever I can.Like you, I've spent the last eight months pining over a guy I cannot have. Like you, I don't have anyone I can talk to about this. Except he was the one who confessed and chased me, and the reason I haven't been able to talk to anyone about this is so I can protect his identity. Long story short, he is not someone available to me, and even despite the confessing and chasing from his end, he has made it abundantly clear that we can never be together, that he'll never be able to choose me. The words have been laid down from the beginning in black and white, and never mind that he was the one who initiated this, who pursued this, but he was also the one who refused to let go, to let me move on. Maybe it was hard for him too, because I know his feelings were real, and he was constantly battling between his heart and mind. But the truth is what it is, and the mixed signals were really tiring - he would be saying one thing, but doing the complete opposite.  Every time I thought I could move on, he would suddenly resurface in my life again, and I would get dragged back into the same cycle, over and over again. He completely messed with my mind - I was so exhausted, not just physically (from not being able to sleep), but also emotionally and mentally. Not to say I blame him - in reality, I'm to blame too, because I could easily put my foot down and cut him off, even if he shows up once again. But it was hard, I won't deny... when his words hurt me I think there's no reason to hold on, and then he shows up and his eyes and actions say something else. Then there're also the times when his words are everything I want to hear, but his actions cut me to the core. Or sometimes everything is in sync, and then suddenly, something happens and he awakens to reality/has a sudden realization, and then once again, everything is not. I don't know which is worse - not having your feelings returned, or having your feelings returned but knowing you'll never be able to be together. To be honest, I also have a general sense of feeling cheated, because why even stir up these feelings if you know you'll never be able to give me anything? And if you know you can't give me anything, why not let me move on?? He kept giving me mixed signals - in both words and actions. He tells me to move on and find my own happiness, but every time it seems like I'm moving on, he holds on even more, and then he'll say or do something and all of a sudden I'm back at that same spot once again. I've cried all the tears there is to cry, over the past eight months. At first it was every day, sometimes multiple times a day, but now I don't even cry anymore- I'm just numb. I've learnt that life still goes on even if you're desperately sad, that you can still function. Is that a sign of healing? Right now we're in this pocket of space where we haven't talked for awhile, as agreed - will it last this time? Do I honestly want it to? It would be so easy to just go back to that time and place, to that space where you forget everything and everyone else. So easy to just cave... Honestly, that would make me very happy, even if it's just hearing his voice or seeing him again, but deep down I know that that's just short term happiness, because it would just mean even more pain in the long run once again. Sometimes I confuse even myself...But I think eventually I realized that even if both parties feel the same, it doesn't matter if the other party isn't willing to fight for you. You don't need to wonder about the reasons why - why it can't work, why you have to let go, why the other person is doing this, what the other person can possibly be thinking or feeling. In the end, if they're not going to fight for you, then you have to be the one to walk away. That's the rational side of me speaking. As you can see, my mind and heart are in constant battles with each other too. But let's both walk away. I hope we're both able to. (I'm so sorry if this is all over the place, but understand that it's eight months worth of pent up emotions and thoughts. I hope you feel better soon. And everyone, if you can just give some advice / constant reminder of what I should do, please do. I'll be so grateful for any little encouragement, because in all honestly, this is really hard, and there's no one I can talk to or confide in, no one who can whack some sense into me. And I'm so afraid I'll cave once again, because really, that'll be so easy to do.)-#96505: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96505","['Like: 9 people', 'Care: 5 people']",7 Comments,2 Shares
96502,"Dear admin, pls post this.To the guy who's been in love with me for idk how long (I wonder):I find that one of the hardest things is to not reciprocate/move on from someone who has a lot of love for you.. It pains me so much to try to walk away from you..you are starting to make me see what true love might look like. What did I ever do.. for you to love me so much? You just make me lose my words sometimes. Why do you keep showering me with affection? Why me?I am scared to even speak to you, I am scared I might fall in love with you. I don’t want to. What if things don’t work out in the long run? I am not ready to lose you and this friendship. I am scared to reciprocate.I don’t even mind me getting hurt, but I will definitely not do anything to cause you pain. This is the least I could do after all the affection you have shown me. You might think I have forgotten all the things you have done for me in all these years.. but really, never ever will I forget! You are as precious to me as I am to you. The first time we spoke many years back, I definitely felt something different about you. I have never told you this, but I knew you were not any other random guy I would come across. At that point, I didn’t think of it as a liking of those sorts but I liked your presence at the very least. Still remember the last time I met you tho. I think it was at a bus interchange haha, it was a coincidental meet. It was a quick few minutes of talk that we had, but is still a good memory on my mind. Seems very nostalgic now. And then, when we got in touch, I liked this friendship and you as a friend..I still do. You haven’t told me this directly but I know. I know you have a lot of love for me. I am scared everytime I come in contact with you..scared you might ask me if I reciprocate your love. Now, I have started to create a small distance between us but I really hope you don’t think it is because I hate you or whatsoever. This distance is for us to not feel as hurt if we have to part ways eventually. You don’t understand how much it pains me to even say this. There is a lot of fear in me with this friendship and the uncertainty about the future. I don’t even know if I am doing the right thing by creating a distance between us. I wish I could make this situation better..Any opinions or advice on this situation is greatly appreciated.-#96502: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96502","['Like: 23 people', 'Care: 8 people', 'Sad: 5 people']",16 Comments,10 Shares
96501,"Opinions needed! I had physical intimacy with a guy whom I like, 6 months into my first relationship. I love him, he loves me, I don't see why not. Today during a heated conversation with my parents on other issues, I let it slipped that I had sex with a guy. They tell me honestly that, they don't think I have enough self love and that I'm like a prostitute, having sex with random guy that I like only 6 months in a relationship. Then they expressed their disappointment in me. (And hatred for the guy, saying the guy did not respect them by having sex with me without even meeting them yet)I really don't know what to do. It makes me feel really sad and I wonder if this is really the case, that I may have been too rash and I don't have as much self love as I thought I had, orit's just how the old people's mind set. It's just kinda sad for me to think that my parents now have this opinion of me. I'm so ashamed. I know they love me still but this really makes me doubt my self worth. It's also my first relationship, so I'm not sure if I had done this right. Friends, is there really an unspoken rule on how long you have to wait before you have sex in a relationship?

96500,"TL;DR — Bf (26M) did some shady shit that broke my (23M) trust, I am not so sure of our relationship anymore. Known and got together with my current boyfriend for less than a year. 3 months into our relationship, bf went to meet online bff (female) for dinner — told me was supposedly 3 pax but last person went MIA. I didn’t feel right in my gut but tried to be understanding. I couldn’t hide being upset, voiced out and he came over to my place to talk things out. At this point my mentality was “you came because you did something wrong and now you feel guilty”. Anyway, this was resolved the same night. I found out earlier this month this was false. The dinner was planned with only both of them in mind right from the start. I didn’t voice this out to him since it’s long over so I’m penning it down here. It really fucking sucks to know about this lol. Next, on the same day when I found out about the above, I also found that my bf and this guy (whom he only knows for less than 3 months) were talking about/planning to go to sleazy massage parlours in Feb. THIS I obviously could not keep mum about this because what the fuck????  We talked about this and came to a conclusion: for obvious reasons he will cut off contact with him. Of course, my bf also had to work on himself for whatever he said to the guy, or for even entertaining it. I gave him the benefit of doubt based on the timeline of response which was also his defense — he was merely entertaining the guy and tried to respond at odd intervals so it doesn’t ever pan out. (Conversation ends early March, no texts to one another) Now, although the situation above has been resolved, I have been deeply affected by it. Before this, I trusted him wholeheartedly. Now, I find myself doubting and wondering if he is actually hanging out with whoever he says he is with (even with telegram short videos) and what he is doing. From the start, He does things to show that he loves me, tells me that, gives me reassurance and what not. We were even planning our future and started saving together (no joint account, just our money in my bank). So for this to happen, you could say I was pretty mind fucked. I couldn’t process it lol because I was so confused. I am not experienced in a relationship and consider him to be my first, so I don’t know if I should continue being with him and rebuild back the trust I had while working on our future together.-#96500: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96500","['Like: 18 people', 'Haha: 12 people', 'Care: 4 people']",55 Comments,10 Shares

96494,"In reply to #96474 (and I hope this gets posted, thanks admin!) Reading your confession stirred my emotions so I'd also like to share my story and take. TL;DR: boyfriend of 3 years dumped me after emotionally and physically cheating on me (with three different girls), and I have since moved on from that douchebag. 25F and 29M. Met in our previous workplace but had no initial feelings for each other as I was attached. Broke up shortly after because of differences (younger guy still in school while I was in the workforce, couldn't meet much, different places and stuff). We got closer about half a year later because of all the opportunities we had to work together, and got together after dating for about 2 months. Everything was good. I met his family, went out with them often (even without my ex) and stuff. Fast forward to 2018, he joined a sales role and basically started to build connections with his teammates, and then started to get close to a few female ones (whom I'll name A B and C). He got close to A, to the point that they'd meet almost every day to do cold-calls and door-knocks together, they'd invite each other to their house to take a shower before heading off to their next destination, he'd drive to her house to pick her up. When confronted, he says that it's normal because he doesn't like to go to his next destination feeling all sweaty and sticky, and his/her house is nearer so they'd head to each other's houses as a pit stop. Quarreled for hours over it, had a cold war and then I decided to let it go (stupid). Next, girl B. Girl B is a friend of ex's close friend (hence friend by extension). Girl B was never really in the picture, but they would hang out from time to time because they're in the same team. And on xmas night, he told me that his team was having a party and he couldn't spend it with me, so ok, we did it in advance. Then, girl B kissed my ex, and they spent the night together. (did not know of this until we broke up) In that same time period, my ex and I both got to know girl C (he introduced me to her when we met up after I finished work nearby). Girl C and him were ""really similar"", and they spent a lot, a lot of time together. Going on roadtrips to malaysia, cooking food for each other (and a few others), having dessert and supper time together all the way until 5am together. He slowly stopped replying me, and I confronted him again about this. He told me to stop overthinking, and started to give me the cold shoulder saying that I was too stressed at work, too paranoid, a pain in the ass, etc. and basically gaslighting me like crazy without me realising it. It took me a lot of courage to take the first step to ask for a break. But when I did, he readily said alright. We took a break for 2 weeks. While I spent almost every night feeling sorry and getting overwhelmed by my emotions, he was probably out frolicking happily. 2 weeks later, he came down to my place and we had a really long talk. He confessed everything, all the lies, about girl B and C. He liked C for a good 3 months by then. He kept justifying himself saying that I'm too overbearing, too clingy, too negative, too much. He then said he no longer feels the same about me. I was pretty lost on what to do at the point, honestly. I went home and broke down, I was a wreck for at least a month. I couldn't eat and sleep, I went to work with puffy eyes, barely conscious. But fast forward to now, I've come out so much stronger than how I was. It really took a lot of effort on my own part. Seeing you in a similar position as how I was, I just want to say: please don't go back to him. Delete him, everything about him. Remove and block him. You won't feel better if he reaches out to you or replies to your messages. You won't feel better seeing him post new photos on social media flaunting how happy his life is. Once the door has shut, it's time to move on. He has someone new and won't spend an ounce of effort trying to even talk to you unless he's lonely. You don't need to stoop so low. Be better than that. There are much more greener pastures for you out there. Keep your head held high. It may take weeks, months, or even years, but someday, you'll look back and realise that he never deserved you. Take care.-#96494: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96494","['Like: 100 people', 'Care: 40 people', 'Sad: 12 people']",9 Comments,11 Shares

Some time back, I found out from the third party that my bf was going to meet her to sleep with her and like that in itself was a huge red flag but because it was the first time and he didn't show in the end cuz he said something like he realized he didn't want anyone else, I let it go. But like after that incident, he's been feeling really distant and it hurts? Like we used to hang out everyday and now he just wants to hang out with his friends and he goes out alone to arcades and stuff and tbh every time he does that I get a lil insecure cause that's what he told me that time, that he was going to go out to buy something, before disappearing an entire day... Not sure how to react anymore, this is the third big drama we had in the few months we were tgt (first being that his mom found something in his phone she wasn't supposed to, then second being that his ex contacted me to tell me he was on okc) and like he claimed to be clean and that he didn't text any other girls besides friendly chatter but he gave me access to his tele and I saw him talking about nsfw stuff? Not sure if it matters but the reason he gave me for cheating was that he didn't want to keep guilting me into ""satisfying"" him every time we had a sleep over (which he did regularly before this) and like because I didn't really feel ready to give up my v card just yet. Honestly I just feel really tired right now, and yeah that's what he says when I try to talk to him about it too - that he's tired and doing his best. I don't really want to give up this rs cause beside all this, he had a lot of good points. So I'm kinda just really lost right now, while he goes off and has fun with his friends and whatnot. Just kinda feels unfair that imo I always did my best and to be fair he used to too, but right now it just feels like I'm the only one clinging to the relationship while he just says he never stopped caring but it just feels otherwise.

96474,"This is a long story- prepare yourself :))A lil introduction here, I am a 21F and my ex is 21M.So, i just broke up with my bf of 4 and a half years. we have known each other since 2014 and have been texting each other everyday since. he asked me to be his girlfriend for 2 years before i fell in love and gave in. he were there for me at every moment of my life, especially bringing me out from depression years ago, promising that he will never hurt me ever. this is the first serious relationship we both had. during our relationship, everything was rocky, we had a lot of ups and downs, on and off relationship but we still stayed until now. he had emotionally cheated on me once in the beginning of our relationship, it had impacted our relationship so much until last year, where i put down the past and stop blaming him for that. Last year, we broke up again and he told me he didn’t love me anymore. after a while, we got back together and everything was fine. i even thought that ever since december last year, everything was perfect. i thought this was our best year yet and we are gonna have a future together. until february 2021, he and his female best friend which i will call A got really close because she broke up with her boyfriend and she was leaning to my bf for support and advices. i know her personally and she is very much in love and loyal to her bf. but they got really close to the point he stayed up till midnight to call with her listening to her cry and complaining even though he have work in the next morning. they even went out for drinks with another friend frequently. they text almost daily and he replies her instantly too. at this point, i got fed up and a lil jealous of their relationship even tho i know they are just friends. so me and him fought about her for a while and took a break. after a day, he msg me and told me that he is tired of our breaks and asked me if we will have a future tgt. then we met up the next day and he told me that he’s tired of our relationship and he felt everything was different since 2019. he told me he wanna break up with me, so i asked him to reconsider as i really love him despite we fight a lot. he then told me to wait until 2nd of april and he will give me an answer. i agreed, but the next day he came to find me after drinking and told me that everything he said the previous night was a joke and said it was a lesson for me to not say break up so easily everytime we fight. i then believed him and we got back together. then 2 days later, we went out for dinner. when we reached my house gate, i told him that i wanna spend more time tgt as it has been a long time since we get some quality time together. he then told me he’s really tired and he really wanna go home. i then complained and fought about him and A’s relationship. he kept quiet the whole time and it was only me who’s shouting. he kept giving me cold replies like ok, i wanna go back, whatever. obviously i got even more angry and heated. at the same time, it was the first day of my period so i was a lil crazy. he then snapped and said he wanna break up for real this time. then only i realise the seriousness of his break up. then we went home, he told me the truth that everything he said 2 days ago was fake and he really wanted a breakup but he felt bad and gave it another try. but after seeing me fighting and shouting at him today, he said he can’t do it anymore. then i wrote a long essay and list to compile the problems we have in the relationship and how to fix them and told him i am very serious about fixing our relationship and changing this time. i also apologised for all the bad behaviour and for that day. then he told me to give him a week to reconsider his decision which is until today. during this week, he followed the girl where he emotionally cheated on me before on instagram, followed few other girls and deleted our pictures on his account. i felt horrible and crushed as i know his answer will still remain the same. today came and we met up. and yes as i expected his answer is still to breakup. reason is that he’s really tired of me and our relationship. he doesn’t wanna be in a relationship or do anything now he just wanna enjoy his life as a single person right now. he also admitted that he had a “hao gan” to his female best friend, A. “hao gan” is like a good impression but not necessarily have feelings. we discussed everything rationally today, there was no fighting or crying just now. so i agreed to his decision to break up today. i am really in despair and i really want him back as i really think we could have a good future. i am thinking of starting a no contact rule to get him back. is he gonna come back after i change into a more positive person? after being together for so long, it must be hard to get over someone. has anyone ever tried no contact with their ex bf and eventually their ex bf really came back? how long does it actually take? what advices do you have for me, please don’t just ask me to move on as i know i should and will be trying to while on no contact rule. thank you for reading until here. i really need some advices here!-#96474: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96474","['Like: 39 people', 'Care: 13 people', 'Haha: 12 people']",84 Comments,18 Shares
96472,"To #96417, been there in your place. I used to think that getting a girl friend would be awesome. It can be, but it also has a lot of cons. You would realize them later because you would find the perfect girl but you might still be unhappy.I had also not properly kissed a girl till I had graduated. And yes, kisses are great, especially when you are asked to close your eyes, you really dunno what to expect and you get the first kiss. But having a girlfriend is very troublesome too.Eventually, you would want to live together. Cuddling is great for a few minutes but it gets really sweaty and uncomfortable after a few mins. Your girlfriend might not like that you like to play games. You have to be considerate and turn off the lights when she wants to sleep at night. She would like to have meals with you and maybe you like your meals with Netflix.I know you would think these are small cons, and you will not believe me that the above is more annoying than sleeping alone. Therefore, let me tell you this. You will be having many relationships. Keep swiping. Use all of Tinder, Bumble, happn, OkC & CMB and when you go running, swipe in between. Use your super likes etc. You will eventually match, you will go on dates, you will have a lot of sex, but at the end, you will realise it is a waste of time. The experiences are great, but the thrill does not match what you would experience if you built something or raised funding for your startup or received great reviews from a customer.You are beautiful. I was overweight, young (3 years younger than girls in my batch), from India (did not know many good bars or places to go) and did not have a good dressing sense. I was so noob that I literally asked permission to kiss and kisses are not great when the other person is laughing. You will have great relationships and then you will realise that what you wanted to do all along was be Elon Musk. Then you will set out on your real dream and change the world.-#96472: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96472","['Like: 31 people', 'Haha: 21 people']",8 Comments,5 Shares
96471,"I share the same sentiments as post #96362 (no job, no home, no spouse, no kid, aimless). Perhaps it all started from being jobless and work defines so much of a person, there’ll be lots of negative thoughts going through your mind, can’t sleep at night, it affects your self worth, your identity and all other aspects of your life, including the confidence to build relationships with people, your finances, and it is easy for things to go downward spiraling. One bad thought leads to another, it’s easy to then make bad decisions which leads to more bad choices.For me, I had to let my new found job go as they were pushing me to work on a case which I had a conflict of interest (could get sued). Looking back, I don’t think I made the wrong choice, it was my integrity at stake. But in the midst of a recession, all of a sudden, the career which I’ve taken steps to build up is gone. It’s also easy to say look for a job, have been trying for 4 months already. Similar to other jobseekers, sent many CVs (tailored to each role) everyday, went for some interviews, nothing so far, perhaps the whole industry talks and all the recruiters have seen my CV. Part time job – yes doing it now but not long term, the contract will end soon. Courses – yes also went for 3 different certifications learn new things but everyone is also upskilling. Savings – have been trying to scrimp and save also. Reached out to my network, after a while people also wonder – eh why this person still can’t get a job, is there something wrong? That’s probably when you wish to run away and hide in a hole, demoralized, beat yourself up over a past decision made, or wish you have a SO to talk to, or a kid to fuss over, instead of posting on an anonymous platform like this, haha. Sometimes I feel that too. Maybe the stress in Singapore is really too much. The only thing that keeps me going is to carry on because I am my strongest advocate.  If even I give up on myself, no one will help me already. And since we are on this topic, if anyone has any permanent roles to recommend / career tips to share, please do let me know also ya.

96470,"I honestly dont know. What did i do that was so wrong that i had to be subjected to such ridicule and harasssment. All i did was just confessing to a guy that i really liked, and it took me a lot of courage to do so. He was single too, so there were no issues. I used to have a pretty good relation with the person i liked. We talked a lot as friends and shared a lot of laughters. Just that he was a popular guy, that is all. Is it because im slightly overweight and not pretty at all? I dont match up to him? That u people had to overly tease him to the extend that i didnt even get any replies from that said confession and we dont talk anymore. Making fun of me, photoshopping pictures of me and sending it around. Do u people think its funny? Even though it happened a few years ago, i have become afraid. Just thinking back on all these memories still makes me cry.  I have become too afraid to take the first step in forming a relationship with someone. Now i have another person i like, but i am too afraid to let my feelings be known so that we can just stay as friends. As the dumb person i am, i maintain a certain distance from the person i like and say things that i dont mean. I dont know what to do, i know i need help to get over the past. Although the pain slowly subsides as time past, it sometimes creeps up on me and hits me.

96466,"Highly introverted girl here, 22F who needs advice in relationships and life in general. Recently I’ve gotten attached to a guy and it’s my first rs. I think my introversion has already been causing some issues. When I spend time with people, just anybody in general even with family and my closest friends, my energy and enthusiasm gets drained super fast. I can be enthusiastic and talk normally for the first couple of hours, but then my energy gets drained quickly and I’ll need to be alone for a long time to recharge. I went for a few dates with my bf and showed this behavior as well. He thought that I was depressed or he did smth wrong and doesn’t seem to get it even though I explained my condition. He is an introvert as well but his condition is not as serious as mine and he can spend time with people normally for hours. Also, I have to keep thinking of interesting and appropriate replies and topics when talking to him in person and texting, which tbh is an additional effort on top of other things I have in life such as studies and cca. I know it’s just the way I am and totally not his fault. I can’t imagine life if I were to get married and have to eat, breathe and sleep with someone 24/7 and idk if it’ll drive me crazy. I’ve thought of staying single for life and if I’ll be happier with that.

96465,"I’ve been in love with a girl for more than 5 years now. Have you ever been so in love with someone that you don’t want to have a relationship with anyone else, even if it means you will be single for the rest of your life? That’s how I feel about her.In the past 5 years, she has been in 2 relationships that ended badly. It was heartbreaking for me to see her put on a strong front, even though I knew she was dying inside. In those moments where I could sense how much anguish she was hiding underneath, all I wanted to do is to be a shoulder for her to lean on. I’ve been told that the purest form of love is when you just want her to be happy, and that’s the only thing I have ever wanted for her.I’m just an acquaintance. But I’m good friends with one of her best friends, through whom I have always asked about her (casually). As long as I have known her, she has been with someone. Even though I couldn’t bear seeing her with someone else, she appeared to be happy, and that was enough for me. She was always happy until she suddenly isn’t.She is pushing 30 now, and has now decided to take a step back from relationships and to focus on her career. She is happy again now, and I’m happy for her.My feelings for her has never changed since the moment I fell for her 5 years ago. I want to marry her and no one else. I want to be everything for her.As I have never dated anyone before, I am terrified and I don’t know how to approach her. After all, I have been in this relationship 5 years more than she has, and I don’t want to cause her more anxiety than she needs.

96454,"Sometimes I wonder if my boyfriend still loves me anymore? I feel like after 5 years and even paying down payment for BTO together, he got quite complacent in our relationship and takes advantage of the fact that I will always be here. This thought came to me because in the past year, I feel like he rather spend more time with his friends than me. We are both in our final year in uni now and are super busy with our own courses, so we don’t spend a lot of time together let alone, see each other (maybe only 3 times a month). But when we do have free time, he’s always hanging out with his friends who he sees everyday in school and he never invites me to join his friends, and I’m not the kind who like to be like “bojio” because I don’t want to impose on people if they don’t want me there fully. And even if we set aside a day to spend time with each other (can be one day in two weeks kind of frequency), he doesn’t treasure the time I set aside for him within my busy schedule as he tends to cut our time together short to go hang out with the same bunch of friends afterwards. And you would think for someone in his final year and spending so much time with friends, he might be doing work with them. Nope. They really just hang out for fun like drinking until morning kind. Also, he can even go the extra mile for any of them like go over to one of their houses late at night for something as simple as talking to them when they are feeling down, but he never does this kind of thing for me? When the same thing happens to me and I text him that I‘m feeling down, he just tell me to sleep it off, tell me he love me and then say he got a busy day tomorrow goodnight, meanwhile his friends get special treatment? He used to also go the extra mile for me during honey moon phase but that faded away after awhile and I guess it got transferred over to his friends. It’s making me insecure because he’s not making effort in showing me he still loves me other than just saying it and actions really does speak a lot louder than words. It doesn’t help that his friend group is mixed guys and girls as it adds this extra layer of insecurity that he might just be more interested in one of the girls. He didn’t even remember my birthday. Breaking up with him over this also feels stupid because we’ve been together for so long and I don’t know if this is just a passing phase, and now there’s the additional burden of the BTO down payment that will go down to waste. So yeah, I will definitely talk to him again and hope that he will actually listen, but I just wanted to know what are the general opinions about this first and whether anyone has overcome this kind of problem in their own relationship?-#96454: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96454","['Like: 55 people', 'Care: 32 people', 'Sad: 17 people']",60 Comments,16 Shares

96442,So...... I dated girl X for 4 years before she decided to break up (2018) with me but wanted me to wait for her too. She told me that she believe we will eventually find each other again. In the process of we did not cut contact totally we would still be snap chatting each other to get the streak going till today (2021) She is in Uni (NTU) while I am serving Ns! During her days in Uni she was super close to this particular guy it was even seen as if they were a thing. Sometimes she would even mute me on her ig stories so I won’t see certain stories. When confronted she guaranteed they were nothing. NOTE: She was the one who told me to give her time and space to sort out her feelings. Many times after our breakup she would often give me false hope and mix signals. She do know that I still have feelings for her even till now. She was on dating apps (ss of her account was sent to me by a anonymous person definitely not catfish because the pics used are not found on her social media) not sure if she even dated anyone while giving me false hopes. Recently in Feb I wanted to end it officially with her because I felt that she wasn’t going to reciprocate my feelings and she made it seem like she really isn’t wasting my time and always told me we would eventually find each other if we are meant to be. ~Plot twist~ 28.03I have been in contact with her TWIN sister (R) for awhile and we met out for lunch too today for her belated birthday celebration. I sense that R has been trying to get my attention and she even went to get the same hair cut as X.... I am not sure if I should continue with X because it’s obvious she’s wasting my time always asking me to wait for her but always giving me false hope and mix feelings.

96440,"Hi everyone, sorry for the rant ahead but I really need some advice and perspective I am currently living with my parents just like many single 20s out there. But my mother is really controlling over every single aspect of my life - from the time I wake up to the time I sleep, from the time I do my school work to what I eat everyday. It’s just this imposing authoritarian presence that I am so stifled in my identity, potential and lifestyle. If I am out and about, when I get home, I have to go through this long questioning about what I eat, what I do ... basically every single detail of my life. And it’s honestly damn tiring. I get that she care about me but there is totally no personal space and boundary to the point that it takes an emotional and mental toll on me. Recently, I watched John’s video on Zula and realised how common this is (from the comment section)https://youtu.be/PtALB_dQGR8Aside from that, my mother has this gender bias whereby the girl (in this case, me) has to do all the saikang/shit job. I have to do all the chores around the house while my elder brother relaxes on the sofa watching tv and playing mobile games. She doesn’t give me a specific list of chores to do. Instead, I am at her every call and demand. So every time she calls me to come and do xyz, I have to go and get it done immediately. When I finally sit down to watch a video or eat, she then ask me to get up to bring her a drink etc. It’s so frustrating - I feel like I am her slave or maid instead of her daughter. I am no financial position to move out on my own or to my relatives (the adults fell out with each other and I am not close to them). I am currently a sad depressed student stuck at home each day, seeing no light at the end of the tunnel.

Due to the pandemic, it's been hard on the both of us as we can't be there for each other physically if something happens. We have been together for 6 months and it's been a little rocky... I'd like to get some advice from you guys on my situation...I think I'm quite low maintenance and I'm not materialistic at all. I like hearing words of affirmation and spending quality time with my loved ones. He is also quite similar. I'm in my early 20s and he's in the high 20s so there is a 8 year age gap between us. Since we can't be with each other physically, we hang out in the call for long hours and we would play games sometimes. He loves playing OSRS so I'd try playing a little and I would watch him as he screen shares his game. Whenever one of us needs to wake up at a certain time we would wake each other up instead of the usual alarm. We would eat and watch shows together too.The relationship overall has been rough and we almost broke off a number of times as he is a little insecure that I'm not there physically with him.. He's worried that I would leave him for someone else (which I would deny every time). He tried breaking things off with me as he says he ""isn't rich"" and wants me to leave so he doesn't have to. He's also worried that he would be making a mistake being with me because what if it doesn't work out? He'd be wasting time. He thinks he's old and I'm too young and he'd be robbing me of my freedom. In one of our ""fights"", he said ""you're going to screw over my life""/""if you're not going to screw me over now you'll do it later"". What I don't get is why did he say all that when he says he's afraid of losing and hurting me? Why does he push me away sometimes? I felt so used and neglected whenever he hung up on me. He has his depressive bouts and would always give me short replies and ignores me for a while. He did tell me once that he wants to die but he's just afraid to do it. It makes me worried because what if something happened? Is he going to leave me again?He's a sweet and thoughtful guy and he makes me feel so loved and cared for even though he's so far away. I try to make him feel the same way but I don't know how. I tried directly asking him but he says I don't have to and that I'm already perfect to him. He would always try to help me in any way he could and if I needed a little money for lunch or dinner he wouldn't hesitate and just told me to get whatever I want. I wanted to get a pc recently and he helped me out a lot which I really appreciate.I tried to make plans in March to head over but it's crazy expensive. Flights are at least 1K and I have to account for the days I have to self-isolate here and there. Not to mention it costs 2K to isolate when I get back now... I am still studying and he is working, but it has been hard on him as his work has been on and off. I feel like our relationship is always revolving around a mountain of ""what-if""s. I have a heap of questions and no one to get advice from... How do you keep the relationship alive despite the long distance? How do you assure someone who's insecure? How do you cope in the relationship if the other party is insecure? What can you do if you're the younger party in the relationship?

96427,"Dear  #96391,I'm a 25 year old male who previously thought that I'm gay. I have only ever had sex with guys and I find myself sexually attracted to girls as well. However, I don't see myself being romantically involved with girls though. In fact, I'm in a relationship with a gay guy for a long time now. I personally believe that sexuality does not boil down to labels. I do think labels came up because it was a matter of convenience though, like it's easier to tell someone you're straight/gay because then the other person would know. But personally, I see it more as a spectrum. For example, perhaps being 100% gay can be represented as the color blue, and being 100% straight is red. Along the spectrum, there will be many shades of purple, right? Some of them will be a red-based purple, and some of them can be blue-based purple. But they're all still purple! So my advice would be to embrace your sexuality, don't let labels restrict you. The only label I believe in is my own identity. And for me, it took a long time for me to be comfortable with my sexuality and have it be a part of my identity, and that's okay. We all are on our own journey!

As my bond is nearing its end, I am thinking of leaving to do a PhD in the same field as my undergrad studies, which is something I would have done back then if not for the bond. But I'm unsure of making the jump now for the following reasons:1) Age. As someone nearing 30 and probably starting a family soon, I'm not sure if leaving the comfort of a civil service job to be a grad student is a wise choice at this point. 2) I've also left schools for a good 5 years, and my knowledge in the field is very rusty. Not sure if I'm able to still cope with the academic rigours of grad school. 3) Risk. There's the risk of not being able to secure a job after a PhD.

We meet only a few times a month and even if we do meet it is only for a few hours for dinner... I know he is literally giving me the bare minimum but I don't know why I still enjoy talking to him and seeing him. But at the same time, I am kinda tired of waiting for him to message me whenever he feels like it. Also, I think he is still friends with his ex but I didn't bring it up bc I don't think I'm in the position to say anything?

96415,"How to deal with very insecure boyfriend... I am very close with my colleagues that we are friends and we regularly hang out after work at least once a month to rant about work or to catch up as we are all wfh. Our group contain 3 girls and 1 guy. I have no romantic feeling toward the guy colleague and truly see him as friend. We have known each other for a year and half. Every time when the colleagues set a dinner date to catch up, I would inform my boyfriend and he will get very unhappy as he knows the guy colleague will be there as well. On the dinner day itself , my bf will be very upset whenever he see my social media and keep finding fault with me. He will blame on the clothes I wore (when it’s my usual everyday wear), or upset that I’m sitting opposite / beside the guy, standing next to him or talking to him.. Even if I don’t post on social media, he will be paranoid and start blaming me for cheating on him. if possible, he will not want me to hang out with my colleagues at all just cause the guy colleague will be there and my boyfriend will have this thoughts that I’m cheating on him.. I have no intention to cheat or know  how to handle this situation. Many times I have told him that there’s nothing between me and the guy colleague and that we are just friend but he is not convinced... I don’t want to stop hanging out with my colleagues as they are my friends who have been with me even before I got to know my bf, but at the same time, I don’t know what else I can do to convince my bf that there is really nothing going on between me and the guy colleague....-#96415: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96415","['Like: 19 people', 'Haha: 6 people', 'Care: 3 people']",34 Comments,2 Shares

One day, he was at a group tutorial and this guy whom he has never seen or talk before approached him if he knows me while following him on Instagram. A few days later, he unfollowed me on Instagram. I went to ask him about it to communicate and he claims he doesn't like the feeling of people intruding into his private life. But here's the question, am I being sensitive or he's selfish? I thought it's actually a very minor issue like he can brush it off or is his mental resistance really weak?

I crave the “accidental” touches to my balls and butthole as they work their way up my thighs. When the time is ripe, I would slowly prop my butt up for to allow them access  to the whole glory of my shaft which bring about many gentle yet sensual strokes that get me moaning so loudly that it might penetrate beyond the thin walls of where I was held captive. As the time closes in on the hour mark, I lose my ability to fight the urge and let everything explode through the gates, with some fragments landing on my face before a relaxing wipedown with a warm towel. As I got attached and married to my current partner, I made a vow to stop visiting such places for the sake of her. However, while the fun is over for me, I have picked up some of those sensual techniques to send intense tingling sensations across my partner’s body and have her moaning and begging for penetration.

96390,"This sem's CS3243 continues to be badly taught and administered. To start off with, the lecture was not conducted well, and there were times when the lecturer just read off his slides. In fact, when a student asked him to clarify on a particular slide, he read the slide again and did not answer the question. By looking at the file information of the slides that the lecturer gave us, the author of the file was not even him, but another prof who used to teach the module. The first part of the project for CS3243 talks about an abstract problem that has not appeared much in literature. Suspiciously, a project on the UROPs/FYPs list matched word-for-word with our project statement, and even under the professor himself. Doesn't it seem like he is mining for ideas from the students of CS3243, ultimately presenting the ""best"" algorithm as his own research? There was no consent given by the students, but there is nothing stopping him from passing on the work of students as his own work.Additionally, for the second part of the project, he has repeatedly pushed back the start date of the project such that it is two weeks behind schedule (week 9 to week 10 Friday), which eats into our revision time since there is a Final Quiz for the module in week 13. The prof also unreasonably expects us to use our reading week to work on the project when we have other exams to study for during reading week as well! Does the university not regulate reading week such that students can focus on their exams, instead of having assignments due then?I feel that there are unreasonable demands made in this module that need to be addressed.

In a group im fine with him but when we hang out for a meal just both of us he really drains my energy and i cant stand him, although in the end he is enjoyable to be around.

The rare occasion that i am late, he will literally spam text me, call me, and jokingly verbally abuse me through text. I dont have mental health issues but i do get very frustrated and irritated because i, who already is always on time, am already uncomfortable myself because i am late. And you, who is ALWAYS LATE, are now popping off because im 5 mins late trying to find a parking lot?

Hence, we are the underpaid and under-recognised profession because that is all we are known for - the people who save doctors that 5 minutes of looking at Lexicomp/UpToDate.

Ask yourself, what really makes you stand out from the crowd, what makes you think that you cannot be outsourced? One prominent figure here mentioned it’s because “modern systems are complex”. Do you think highly intelligent Indian developers cannot handle complex systems? These guys who migrate are insanely proficient (given many of them begin coding as kids with a specific goal in mind), infinitely more driven than your average local Joe and can speak better English than most of you. In a country like Singapore which prides itself on prostituting its workers to foreign companies, the lower price always has the advantage and in this case, the quality remains uncompromised too. The legal and healthcare sectors and somewhat protected by regulatory and licensing bodies, but who’s protecting the software developers? I believe it’s just a matter of time before companies start to take advantage of this and salaries get undercut.

The other companies started their process much later, they're just as complicated, but we are already in the final round later this week. Some people say ""the company that does this is not worth your time"", but that's not actionable advice, and I don't feel it's fair to blame everyone else there for something one person in HR is doing.-#96327: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96327","['Like: 17 people', 'Haha: 2 people']",4 Comments,2 Shares
96322,"Hey guys! Hoping to get some inputs regarding insurance policies.. I will be starting work soon and am looking to buy insurance for myself and my parents. Based on what I've gathered, it seems like the more important ones that we should get would be - (1) Health insurance to cover hospitalizations (again there's the consideration of whether we should get private/ public hospitalisation cover), critical illness and disabilities, (2) life insurance and (3) (?) accident insurance. I've been looking at integrated shield plans and riders as well. However, I've been left rather confused given that there are so many different policies and guides out there >< As such, am wondering if anyone has any advice/ insights to offer with regards to which policies I should buy for myself and my parents. If you have a particular one to recommend, it'll be really helpful as well! Thank you! -#96322: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96322",['Like: 7 people'],23 Comments,3 Shares

Or doesn't even know his full name, how many family members he has etc. I met someone of similar kind, and I wasn't sure how to feel about it. There were warning signs telling me to stop whatever I was doing, but I discouraged myself from doing so because I felt that maybe he is sincere. Unfortunately, things didn't work out. Now I'm not too sure if we are even friends, not that it matters already. Please advise on guys or even ladies, not wanting to reveal much of their personal information to you, for whatever reasons. Should one carry on to date and see how things go, or discontinue?

96302,"tldr: if parents weren't married, father would most likely be guilty of at least sexual harassment and stalking. what can i do?Hi everyone, my parents are in a very weird dynamic now and would like to ask for help on anything I can do to help? Basically here's the brief run down on what's happening:- there is no love in the marriage, they were basically ""forced"" to marry despite not liking each other (sometimes i wonder how i even exist, i strongly suspect it's a very dark reason (readers fill in the blank yourself))- father suspects mother has affair (which i believe doesn't exist), and so has recently been getting very crazy, reading through every message/phone call in my mother's phone (he managed to guess my mother's password), scrutinizing all of her schedule and work documents secretly. also he's been stalking my mother by going to a food court near my mother's workplace and spying on her, to track her movements and the people she's with (although i think he's stopped now). - father is also a dirty pervert. once caught him masturbating behind my mother while touching her shoulder. also i saw him sniffing mother's panties hanging in the toilet (he doesn't know i saw). mother doesn't know all this other than being touched unwillingly. - father keeps telling me he wants to kill the guy he suspects is chasing mother, also father has said he wants to harm mother's family (they fell out)- mother has been trying to divorce father multiple times, but father keeps refusing.- basically i'm also trying to help mother divorce father because father is just a complete asshole, but looking at sg divorce law, i'm surprised the criteria for divorce is so strict? i don't know which line my parents satisfy, no one has committed adultery, no one has deserted anyone, we are still living together, and no one has been physically violent or anything. at most we satisfy the ""cannot be reasonably expected to live with defendant"" part, but that sounds so vague and open to interpretation, not sure if we satisfy that.- also a bit worried divorce will be rejected because father is quite old now, he has no savings, won't be able to work for much longer, and basically can't live independently cos he doesn't know how to pay his bills and stuff. can the court reject divorce on the grounds of ensuring a vulnerable old person like the father has someone to take care of him? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.-#96302: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96302","['Like: 11 people', 'Wow: 2 people', 'Care: 2 people']",26 Comments,1 Share
96300,"I've just recently come to the startling realisation that I (22M) still have no idea how to make friends? I don't think it's about being harder to make friends in uni, even in secondary school and JC, I think I never actually progressed with anyone beyond an acquaintanceship. It's like in school, you just talk random crap to the people sitting around you, discuss school work, and at the end of the day, you go home and no one cares about you or texts you except to ask for help on homework. Meanwhile, I see almost everyone else hanging out outside of school, be it to go shopping, watch movie, play sports, etc., but no one has actually asked me to hang out before? So far now I have pinpointed a few possible reasons why no one seems to want to be my friend:1. I have nothing to talk about. I don't follow mainstream media (movies, dramas, music). I don't play the games everyone is playing (e.g. Maple, Dota, LoL). I have no knowledge about any pop culture stuff (e.g. Harry Potter, LoTR, Star Wars, Disney, whatever show is on Netflix, ...). I simply have no interest and do not really like all this stuff. If I force myself to get into these stuff, I feel like I would be just ""mugging"" pop culture and that just sounds totally incredulous to me. I do have hobbies though, I am really passionate about more extreme music like black/death metal, and I learnt to play bass because of this music, but whenever I talk about this people just look at me like some weirdo (especially Christians lol), or just brush me off and never talk about it again. I also like to play computer games, but I usually play games that are 10-20 years old because that's all my computer can run (e.g. I just completed my 5th play through of GTA SA), and also don't really like multiplayer games because they give me more anxiety than fun. On a related note, I don't know how to start a conversation. I googled some conversation starters but almost all of them sound so cringy to me, like I literally don't give a shit what you did during the weekend, or what book you read recently. I feel very uncomfortable asking such textbook conversation openers because then I would be insincere and being fake and I hate being fake. 2. I don't make a lot of eye contact. I heard it's supposed to be a very natural thing, but I am personally super intimidated by it, I will instinctively avoid people's eye contact in less than 1 second, and if I force myself to maintain eye contact, I will literally shudder in anxiety after 2-3 seconds. Am I giving off bad vibes by not making eye contact? Is this how people judge whether you want to be their friend? I really have no idea since I don't look at people's face anyway but that doesn't mean I don't want to be their friend. 3. I am not physically attractive. Sometimes I think that there is something about my appearance (although I don't know what) that puts people off? E.g. there have been multiple times, where I was taking the bus, and the whole bus is packed except for the last empty seat beside me, and yet no one wants to sit beside me to clear up more space? Also when meeting new people in uni, I can literally see the fear on their faces when I am talking to them. Anyways I still have tons of questions about making friends. How does friendship develop? Do people look at somebody, think ""I want to be this person's friend"", and then try some tricks to make that person your friend? Or are friends usually made by people just naturally gravitating together? Is there some secret trick that people do to make friends that I am just wholly unaware about? Must you have common interests with someone to be the person's friend? Anyways, I also want to be able to practice making friends, but I have no idea how to. I am a bit averse to practicing in real-life situations by trying to go out and join communities, because I'm scared half of Singapore will end up knowing me as the creepy awkward guy. In conclusion, I would really appreciate some answers and advice from anyone. I still want to get married and have kids and stuff, but how am I supposed to get a girlfriend if I don't even know how to make a friend? Thanks. (PS I know some of the questions I ask can be easily googled, but I am aware that a lot of stuff on google are written in from a Western/American perspective which may not be transferable to Singapore, so I am hoping to just get some more locally relevant answers.)-#96300: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96300","['Like: 8 people', 'Care: 3 people', 'Sad: 2 people']",8 Comments,3 Shares

Obviously I refused but couldnt help but wonder why even bring this up after being exclusive for more than 2 years. Also, what does this mean when one brings up an idea like that? Is it getting boring for her? Even then there was no indication from her mood or attitude or 'bedroom time' that would suggest anything had changed.

96284,"Dear #96104 &#96224I was in a 10 year relationship with someone whom my parents didnt approve of. I literally grew up with this person on my side all the time but he was just like ur ex - he felt that there was no way he was going to convince my parents. He told me directly, "" if you want to get married to me, find a way to leave your house."" When my parents first found out about us, they went mad. They said no way and that i will suffer if i marry him. But i was adamant. I was determined that this was not going to change my decision and didn't speak to my family members. We constantly fought each time they found out i was out him.In the beginning, i tried to ignore the bigger problem. I told myself that when the time is right everything will fall in place. But it does not.Like your ex, he had issues with his  job, he was not responsible and it was me who started earning a steady income while he was busy job hopping n clubbing. I didnt mind paying for everything because i loved him. But reality hit me. My friends who were together for 2-3 years had plans to BTO, they were planning their lives ahead.  But i was still handling this person and helping him steady his life. He made it look like we weren't planning anything 'cos my parents didnt approve.'Worse, he wouldn't want to talk to my parents or get his parents over to mitigate the issue. I often asked him about just making things formal so that it wouldn't be that awkward for us in future. But he said nope. He said his ego was much bigger and no way he 'was going to step into my parent's home'.Long story short, i decided one day to end the relationship based ENTIRELY on his decision not to come over n speak to my parents. It said a lot about how much he was willing to show he loved me.I was not asking for money or vacations or expensive rings. Just to be on my side to tell my parents together that we got it all settled and to assure them. But he said no.This was not about my parents, but it was about me. About us. It also hit me that he was not confident because my parents were not wrong about his behaviour and irresponsibility. It took me a long time to get over the decade. But trust me, looking back, i am so glad i didnt choose to stay with someone who valued his ego over our relationship.  It hurt like mad, but time definitely heals. PLEASE BELIEVE THAT LIFE MOVES ON.

96278,"I am facing something similar to #95814, but 10000x worse.I have a great LT boyfriend who loves me very much and I love him too.But recently, I've felt this attraction/spark with a close friend. The problem is we have been good friends for many years (to the extent that our whole group of friends often visit each other's homes for gatherings, our +1s are aware of all our existence). And in all those years, we've never felt this spark til recently when our conversations started getting deeper.This attraction/spark/passion has really been burning strong... we both feel it... and I'm thinking maybe it's because it's forbidden? But yet it's not just this passion either because there's also the emotional connection, and the depth of conversation is unparalleled. We've been really good friends for years and so we've been quite open and honest about it - but the extent of this feeling is pretty crazy. Like he told me he loves me, and feels guilty about it, since he's married with kids.This whole thing has really been confusing me... and it has been torture because this feeling has been ongoing for a year, on both our ends. To the point where we're both so tired trying to do the right thing, that it became clear that maybe friendship has to be put on hold at least for now, and we've agreed to stop talking and meeting at least for the time being, til we're ready to be friends again, and we've been going out of our ways to avoid each other at social gatherings. It has been awhile and I do feel a lot better now... but it has made me wonder if perhaps there is something wrong with me, or perhaps something is lacking in my current relationship, for me to feel this way, even though I know it's wrong.

96276,"Hi everyone, I need some advice please. The context is that I am an undergrad with a girlfriend who works full time. We have already BTO-ed and plan to get married in 3 years.There’s been much stress in planning a wedding, as we are having an inter race marriage, and as such, have to accomodate to various customs. Regardless, that is something we have to go through anyway, so no complaints. It’s a rite of passage. The problem is that I feel as though I am simply getting too tired, not taking care of myself. I feel that every moment of my life is spent taking care of her and her needs, as she struggles with many problems. I’ve been her rock, and yet I feel like I am cracking. I am constantly listening to the rants and complaints, and it never ends. I find it difficult to deal with the fact that I seem to be an emotional dumpster, struggling with the baggage while people carry on with their lives. However, how can I stop, when I’m the only one she has who understands?This becomes much worse when I am accused of not initiating dates for her to be pampered and such, showing her how much I love her. While there might be some truth in the sense that I haven’t been doing much, I do have a valid reason, that I’ve simply been spending too much. I have explained time and time again that I’m doing my best to save for our future, but it appears to fall on deaf ears. Most of my money is being spent on taking her out to lunch and dinner to places she’s craving for. I am constantly burning through my wallet for her sake. Yet, it never seems to be enough, as there’s always something she feels “I can do better”. The clincher, is that I don’t get treated the way she demands to be treated, which does cause a bitter taste in my mouth. I have attempted to communicate this discrepancy, to disastrous results as she starts to be self-loathing, bemoaning her other responsibilities.I want this to work out for the best, but I think some can relate with the sense of hopelessness I feel now. This passive aggressiveness has led me to feel as though I should just suck it up, even though it’s not right.

I've heard friends complain about how it was bad with their ex but good with their current, so what exactly is considered good skills like the comments say????2. On average, how many rounds can a guy go in a day normally? 3. How frequently do people actually have sex??4. Is sexual intimacy / compatibility really that important if everything else is great? Now I'm genuinely worried for when I get married, what if its really bad??? Or what if one wants it more often than the other? 5. Does passion / sexual tension / wtv its called actually last? For people in LT relationships or who are married. Won't it die down or get boring after awhile? 6. People always talk about guys' skills, but I've never heard people talk about girls' skills... so how exactly can a girl be good at sex??

96269,"Should girls serve army?As Singapore advances (albeit slowly) towards a more inclusive society, gender equality has been frequently brought into the limelight. In Singapore, other than equal job opportunities and job prospects, the idea of females serving national service has been suggested many times as well. After all, it does seem fair that in our pursuit of gender equality, females should have their lives held back 2 years as well right? Or well, so it seems…Before I voice my opinion on this matter, I would like to state that I am a guy providing a male perspective on this issue. If this already triggers you or if you plan to invalidate the things I say further on because of this, please scroll pass this post.In my opinion, girls should NOT be mandated to serve army, and never should. Providing alternatives like ""they can serve as nurses what"" is just a desperate attempt to fulfil your emotional revenge on them, that since you wasted 2 years of your life, everyone should too. This should not be the case. Males were conscripted into army for the sole reason for national defense, and if girls are not able to fulfil that role as well as men do (for obvious biological differences), why are we trying to argue for females to go into national service? Nursing is a noble and honorable profession which requires years of clinical experience and exposure, and I do not think that a constant disposable supply of nurses will help the healthcare scene at all. ""Then ask the girls to do basic first aid la!"" - Please la use your brain do you really think there is any VALUE in mandating girls to spend 2 years of their life to do basic first aid? You think Singapore is a warzone in need of constant first aid that requires our WHOLE female population to be held back 2 years to treat your cuts and burns? Compare this to army, where it is a unique scenario where quantity does inherently triumph over quality, and in Singapore's quest to create a strong deterrence force, we need a constant supply of people to rake up our defense numbers. After all, we are a tiny red dot and what we need for intimidation is our defense numbers and state of the art defense equipment. Of course, quality in leadership is needed in army, but you also need a fair share of gundus to chiongsua during war, hence explaining our need for mandatory national service. There is inherent VALUE in guys serving national service to act as a deterrence force for our nation, while there is little to no VALUE in girls using 2 years of their life to learn a skill that can be learnt in a few hours.Well then, what is the solution to this whole saga? Frankly, there is none. Hear me out, the only solution to this scenario is appreciation for each other. Nothing triggers a guy more than when a girl says ""aiya 2 years v fast one la stop complaining"", or ""we need to get pregnant also what"" Let me just address the pregnancy argument really quickly. If this is your stance, does this mean that every female who has hit menopause and is nulliparous must serve the army immediately? What about young girls who cant or do not want to get pregnant? Throw them into army as a ""punishment""?Do you guys see the problem now? There are entitled males who feel that ""since we wasted 2 years of my life, so should you"", and there are also entitled females who feel that ""we are already disadvantaged in society, your 2 years is nothing compared to us"". What we need instead is appreciation for each other. Dear girls, while it is true that army is something that a guy should do, a simple ""I know it sucks but thank you"" is so much better than ""aiya just suck it up la 2 years only"". Correct me if im wrong girls, but if you're pregnant, wouldn’t the best thing to hear from your husband be that he is appreciative for everything you're going through for him and the family? I'm pretty sure you would not want to be hearing things like ""eh my mother say she wants 3 kids leh when are we having our 3rd one ah?"" while you're pregnant right?Appreciation goes a long way in this world, and in this context of army conscription, it is needed more than ever. And to the girls who wish to serve the nation as well, I'm sure MINDEF will welcome you with open arms.

The conversation started off weird as we were talking about interests and hobbies and all she mentioned was how much she enjoyed working out, going to the gym, lifting, and her experiences being in rowing or dragon boat, as though it was a personality trait. She told me she was maintain a strict workout and diet regime in order to hit xx weight and break her pr (??). Since when did exercising become an identity?!Then the conversation steered towards income and salary, and she mentioned how she secured a high paying job in the tech industry while not majoring in CS/tech related. Saying that she would never have accepted any less than xx amount and all her friends are struggling to find jobs. Then she said that guys must earn more than her, be able to pick her up in their own cars bring her to fancy cafes and restaurants etc. WTF?!Is this what the dating scene looks like in 2021?

It was during this stage that I noticed two powerful personalities whose job scopes involved working extensively with all the stakeholders in my Battalion.

I’m talking about the regulars, the OCs, the CSMs even the RSM and the CO. When they speak, everyone treats them with a lot of respect, displaying an unprecedented level of appreciation. Never before have I seen NSFs so highly esteemed by regulars and never before have I seen anyone (regulars or NSFs) enjoy such high levels of popularity amongst the NSF population. There was an aura of awe and mystery surrounding this pair and the next 8 months of my NS life was spent unravelling the threads of this story.But before I go further, a bit more about myself. My pro term was spent in Stagmont – Home of Signals and at the end of pro term, I thought that would be the last I would see of Stagmont, at least until ORD. Lo and behold, after donning the chevrons, I was posted to my current unit, literally fed to the wolves (iykyk) and I was dreading the thought of spending the rest of my NS life on repetitive manning. Thankfully, for reasons not relevant to this story, I was not made to live that life. Of relevance is that courtesy of this fact, I got a front-row seat to the exploits of this pair. (and now back to the story)Right from the start, this pair was already a cut above the rest. I learnt that they enlisted into the same BMT company, they went to SCS together, they went through SCS together, they were posted to the same vocation, they were posted to the same unit, they even ORD-ed together. It was as if the Army itself conspired to bring them together. And what’s even more incredible, both of them did exceptionally well in Command School – they finished in the top 1% and top 10% of their cohort. And when I say the Army deliberately brought them together, I say this because it is unheard of for the golden and silver bayo (of the same formation!) to be posted to the same unit, especially since that unit only had 2 openings in the same platoon! (From a policy/planning perspective, it will only make sense to ensure an even distribution of top cadets so that more units can benefit, as opposed to sending the elite few to a single unit.)In hindsight, this decision to send both of them to the same unit paid off though, for reasons which I will now explain.This pair was very effective together. They were clearly subject matter experts and they segregated their roles such that broadly speaking, one of them was more concerned with the policy/planning side of things while the other one of them was more on the ground, involved with the implementation side of things. Using this structure, they set to overhauling the logistics management system for the Battalion, implementing more stringent and robust SOPs to ensure accountability. Spanning over a year, it was their display of professionalism and dedication to their tasks that won over the rest of the Battalion. A refrain commonly heard was, “[A] and [B] have truly done a lot for the Battalion since their arrival” along with “y’all really work very hard for the Battalion”. Perhaps what the regulars really valued was the fact that these two NSFs went over and beyond the call of duty, voluntarily taking on roles and work that would’ve been assigned to regulars and thus lightened the regulars’ workload.But maybe, the reason why this pair was able to do so much was because they loved spending time together. Where others would strengthen their bond going on dates and asking each other out to go on dates, this pair invested their time working closely together on projects, genuinely supporting each other, building something tangible together. Not to mention the close proximity five days a week, eating together, showering together, sleeping together. Taken together, they have fulfilled the three requirements for a relationship to flourish – equality, proximity, and intimacy. Equality, parties respect each other and bring value to the relationship in their unique capacities; proximity, parties spend time together and meaningfully interact with each other; intimacy, parties express their affection for each other.I would want to elaborate more on intimacy. When people think of intimacy, they immediately assume this means physical intimacy and more specifically sexual intercourse. However, intimacy is about expressions of affection. There are many ways to express affection, not just physically. And physical expressions of affection aren’t just limited to sex, take a leaf from this couple’s playbook.Acknowledging the environment that they are in, this pair expresses their affection discreetly and in very thoughtful ways. It comes in simply and constantly – one party waiting for the other to finish his task before taking their meals together. It comes sweetly and discreetly – in the clasping of hands when they think others aren’t watching. It comes fleetingly and attentively – in always looking for each other and smiling when the eyes meet.In such a hostile environment, these two individuals are able to grow and develop together, forming a relationship that is more than the sum of their substantial parts. Secret, commendable and beautiful, their opening chapter might have been written in NS but we’ll await the day they complete this magnum opus.Having been months since they’ve left the Army, I miss them, I really do.-#96263: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96263","['Like: 50 people', 'Care: 13 people', 'Haha: 5 people']",27 Comments,16 Shares
96255,"My girlfriend works in a completely different industry from me. That day she made a comment about something in my line and I told her that was inaccurate. To my surprise her immediate reaction was “but all my friends in your industry” apparently told her the opposite of what I said. To be fair I am not sure how truthful she is as she has a habit of saying “all my friends think so too” to back up anything she has to say if I have a different point of view. Personally I find this a very annoying habit. I mean is this even a valid argument to begin with?!Anyway what she said was clearly wrong so I explained to her why and she agreed after hearing my train of thought. Then I said so yeah your friends don’t seem to know what they are talking about if they really said that. To my surprise she turned on me in anger because apparently now I have “insulted” her friends. She went on to say that it “reflects badly” on me and that I must “feel the need to put down others to pump myself up”. I was just like huh where is this coming from, why are you insulting me now when I just stated some facts? She then yelled at me saying “you are the one who insulted my friends!!!”What does everyone here think of what happened?

96250,"Am I the ass for being upset at the way my girlfriend handled my birthday?One month before my birthday, I told her it was a big year for me and I am very excited about it. I asked if she is willing to take leave on that day to spend it with me and it will mean a lot to me. She suddenly snapped at me and said I have no right to ask her to do that and got so unproprotionaly angry that I was hurt and confused. Including rollover she has 30 unused leave days this year and has no upcoming travel plans. I got an entire lecture from her on how it is her right on how to use her leave days. I found this whole talk on ""rights"" super turn-off.Two weeks before my birthday she told me she will bake a cake for my birthday. Then three days before my birthday she said she forgot to get the ingredients, can I keep the whole day empty and she tell me on the day itself if she can bake a cake for me? I thought this was somewhat quite selfish of her to expect this because if she cannot then it is too late for me to make alternative plans but I said okay. One day before my birthday she told me she won't be able to bake a cake for my birthday but will make it up to me and bake the cake a week later, instead on my birthday she will come after work and have dinner with me at my place ordering takeaway food. I said okay.She surprised me by coming a few hours later at 11.30pm just before my birthday after I had already gone to bed to surprise me with a slice of cake she dabao earlier in the day, and left an hour later, telling me she will come back to my place for dinner. While it was a nice surprise, it did mess up my sleep cycle as I usually sleep and wake up early. When I woke up though on my birthday, I got a message from her, saying I am free anyway since I took leave on my birthday so I should be the one traveling to her place to celebrate my birthday and not the other way round. She said this despite one month ago I already told her I wish to just stay home on my birthday this year. I told her I wished she could be more reliable especially given the context and she proceeded to spend the next 3 hours on a work day for her, screaming at me, and tearing me to shreds, on my birthday itself. She told me not only is she definitely not coming, she will not be baking a birthday cake for me a week later as ""it does not spark joy for her"".I said you left me hanging, and systematically ruined a super important birthday for me step by step, until the day itself, when it was too late for me to make any alternative plans. She denies all responsibilty and proceeds to gaslight me. Even a week later, she still says it is completely my fault. Her logic and defense now is that she gave me the option to travel to her place at a time of her choosing (she will tell me 30 minutes before she is free so could be anytime between 5pm and 11pm) on my birthday and because I chose not to take this option, it is completely my fault for ruining my own birthday. She said she did her best and hence she is not sorry at all and I have no right to expect her to be sorry. Gosh, another ""rights"" thing going on.To add some detail, she also neither got me a card nor a gift on my birthday. I asked this in passing (it is not the most important thing to me but it would have been nice) and she said what for, not like I got her anything for hers, which is not true at all. I forwarded her back her old message thanking me for the gift and card I got her for her birthday, saying how touched she is. She defended herself by saying oh of course she remembers those things are from me, just that she forgot it is a birthday gift, as she uses them every week.She is so sure that I am in the wrong and not her, that I am left feeling confused, hence I am hoping others here can share their thoughts from an outsider's perspective. For me I am very hurt and upset. Should I be? Or am I over thinking and over sensitive? Can you share how you will feel and how you will handle the situation during and after, if your bf or gf had done the above to you with regards to an important year birthday for you?-#96250: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96250","['Like: 68 people', 'Sad: 57 people', 'Angry: 43 people']",224 Comments,30 Shares
96248,"As a girl, are you okay with your bf liking the photos of other pretty girls on social media, assuming these are girls he does not know in real life?Recently my bf is trying to become an influencer on social media. I understand that starting out is difficult and you have to like and follow others to start getting any traction at all. That does not change the fact that he is liking photos of girls with shapely bodies or wearing very little clothes which I feel is so disrespectful to me. Despite not direct messaging them, he still replies to them publicly when they leave comments on his posts, which makes me really upset. I have spoken to my girl friends and all of them share the same views as me, comforted me, and encouraged me to speak with my bf. They all believe he is firmly in the wrong.However when I spoke to him, he was enraged that I went to talk to others about him, instead of going directly to him first. He is also upset that I am questioning his loyalty and says that while I was busy suspecting him and badmouthing him to others, he has been busy doing things for me, planning surprises for me and buying things for me. He was truthful that he was doing all these but still when I asked him to delete his social media accounts or at the very minimum, unfollow all girls, he refused, which to me is a major major red flag.Since we started dating, he has always been loyal to me but I cannot get over the fact that he is my first and he has had many exes before me. I am just a girl who wants a loyal bf who respects me and not be the next unsuspecting victim who only finds out after her bf has been cheating on her for half a year. I cannot understand why he cannot see my point of view.-#96248: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96248","['Like: 25 people', 'Haha: 12 people', 'Care: 3 people']",33 Comments,12 Shares
96246,"Does anyone else have experience with dating an emotional vampire?What do I mean by that? Well for instance my gf likes to call me out of the blue for 1-2 hours each time, not caring whether I am busy or not. But after each call, it never leaves me energized, rather I feel emotionally drained, stressed, exhausted, hurt, and need hours to recover each time.When we meet in person, no matter how much effort I put in, she gets angry over the tiniest things and ruin everything. For instance I might have spent upwards of 10 hours planning something for her, and we are having the best day ever, doing everything she enjoys, and all expenses on me. On the way home, I tapped my key card to open the house gate downstairs, she was next to it and didn't even bother opening it, nvm I open it for her but let go of the gate 1 second too early because she was reading messages on her phone instead of walking and the gate hit her ankle, she screamed at me for 30 minutes straight and cold war me for the rest of the night. It makes me feel like every meeting with her is doomed anyway and I am just taken for granted.There are two other things in our relationship which infuriate me a lot. The first is that she is a very suspicious person and will invent all sorts of weird thoughts I never had and blame me for them. For example she might think I like another girl whom I don't even know and then I will have to spend the next five hours convincing her that is not true. I find I waste so much of my time defending myself about thoughts I never had.The other thing which infuriates me a lot is what makes things even worse. Not only is she lost in her own mind thinking weird thoughts about me, she does not even hear what I actually say to her! Let's say she gets angry at me and raises a concern, I will respond to it with an explanation or a question. However, she won't even bother to hear what I have to say, she will just scream over me such that neither of us can hear anything, and repeat herself up to twenty or more times in a row. I never understood why. It is like she does not actually want to hear what I have to say, it is like she doesn't want to resolve anything, it is like she just wants to rant and cut me down. Even if I patiently listen to her for a good twenty minutes, the moment she finished and I open my mouth, she will cut me off even before I can finish my first sentence.Somehow my gf is thoroughly convinced and I can tell she really believes this instead of just saying it, that she is a good, kind, thoughtful, considerate, sweet person, despite abusing me this way. In 2.5 years of dating, she has never owned any fault for any of our quarrels or fights before and will not let go until I apologize for everything, even in situations when it is almost all or entirely her fault. She repeats her belief so much that I often even fall for it, but when I sit down and try to think things throughly rationally, I am like wait a minute, how can this be true?Even though she is an abusive emotional vampire, I love her a lot. Things did not start out this way and at the start I did think she was a very nice and fun person. She has become a part of my life and while she is causing so much havoc and chaos, it is difficult for me to imagine life without her. It's like suffering or suffering the two options for me.

I've always thought he is huge as he fills me up completely and the fit is really tight and snug. If he is not gentle or if I am not ready, it can even be super painful. He is also able to hit my cervix if he goes hard.Length-wise he is about 10cm (3.9 inches) which from reading this page seems to be on the smaller side which is what confuses me.

96243,"Guess I reach a stage in my life where most of my friends are attached or married but I am single. Tried my best to avoid meeting them that often because of the constant persuasion on whether I really wish to settle down or stay single forever. Honestly, I used to focus on career advancement since I do not have much luck in love. The guys are either not ready to settle down, just playing around or making used of me, not sure what they want in love. As i saw many divorce cases in my family tree, it made me so scare that just another person might hurt me again. So I told myself to stop loving anyone for 5years &more. Recently, I have thoughts of settling down. Looking around me, most of my friends are girls and even my guy friends are majority married or attached. I do not believe in dating applications because most of them are just after good looking girls whereas I am just a average looking girl. I do not wish to disappoint my grandma as she told me she wish to see me married before she passed away. I really do not know what to do and need some suggestions.

96242,"With all the hate on small dicks these days, and that most men probably suffer from insecurities with their size, I would like to chime in as an ex sex addict/veteran who probably had over 50 sex partners ranging from hookers, escorts, fwbs and ex-gfs, and got by with an average or below average penis judging from how sizes get way inflated online. 1) It is probably common knowledge that vaginas come in different sizes, but tightness is a skill that can be trained. The best sex I had was with a caucasian escort who was really skilled at gripping my penis and making me climax real quickly. On the contrary, the worst sex I had was on a drunk hookup where the girl basically just spread her legs and expected all the work from me. It was a frustrating session that I couldn’t even cum after 2 hours. So ladies, please get good at tightening your vaginas and stop complaining about your man’s size.2) Well dude, if the lady you are having sex with doesn’t want to work on that and you desire tightness, I realized from experience that women who are chubbier tend to have them a lot more snug and warmer by default. 3) Explore sex positions that allow for deeper penetration and experiment with how certain hip placement makes her feel tighter. I wouldn’t go into detail about this as there should be ample resources online on this topic.4) Stop watching so much porn (Applies to both men and women). This creates unrealistic expectations of manhood size for women, and also creates problems such as erectile dysfunction for men. Yup, what’s the use of a big penis or a grower if it never gets rock hard? The ability to open many tabs and search for different kinks with a few clicks would desensitize you from real sex. Real sex is sweaty, and can smell funky from all the vaginal fluids too.-#96242: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96242","['Like: 72 people', 'Haha: 35 people']",30 Comments,19 Shares
96227,"Hi , I'm 20 and consider myself straight. But I met this gay guy at school (age 21) and we really got on. We made fast buddies and I admit I did strangely find him attractive. He's taller than me, lean, thick dark hair, and super- blue eyes. The first hint that something was up was when we were in the shower cubicle at the campus gym and I saw him naked. It totally turned me on. Fortunately, I had my pants on because there was definitely an erection. So some time goes by and we hang out (and yeah, in between I did jerk off imagining him). Then one night about a few months ago I was over at his house and we were watching a movie. We were sitting pretty close together and I felt inclined to hold his hand so I reached over and took it. He didn't even seem surprised, though I did notice a smirk on his face. Anyway, he didn't pull away and we just sat there holding hands for awhile. Then we sort of glanced at each other, and he leaned forward and kissed me. Then I kissed him back and we made out on his couch (at some point we were even lying down, him on top of me, and that got me even more turned on). He led me by the hand to his bedroom, we took each other's clothes off, and had sex (everything short of anal since I was not prepared for that in more ways than one). And I was confused but pretty happy, and it was honestly better than any sex I've ever had with a girl (though my experience in that arena is rather limited). I ended up spending the night with him. From that point on, our interactions changed. When greeting each other, we kiss, I spend a few nights a week at his place.My roommate (who is also gay) walked in to our apartment once and found me with my head in his lap and him stroking my hair. Afterwards, my roommate referred to him as my boyfriend, and I had to correct him, because again, I'm straight, but I feel strongly connected with him and enjoy spending time close to him. But then last night my sister asked how things were going with my boyfriend. She said it jokingly, but it's starting to make me self- conscious. Am I misinterpreting this relationship, and we're more than just close buddies who periodically have fun? Is it possible I'm not straight, or do no other straight guys feel comfortable doing stuff like this?

96226,"I am the one who write on confession #96104. First of all, i sincerely apologise for all the paragraph and English that is not type properly. Also all the headache and eating of panadol to some people that I have cause. Let me change on the phasing and English.I was in a 6 years relationship. Due to my family objection on our relationship, we have to break up. I have been arguing with my family because of this relationship. Despite how much I try to convince my family, this relationship is worth, they will still comment "" if you think is worth than go ahead but end of the day even if I marry will end up divorce"". Additionally, for the pass few month, after I choose to proceed with the relationship and tell my family on my plan to have house and marry, they will either ignore my words or find way to stop me or give me very stastic answer. The main reason why my family feel that this bf is not worth together, they feel that he do not have proper job. starting when he work freelance, they feel he had no stable cpf. After I try to convince him to work full time job, my family got no objection. moving forward, after he work for 1 years plus, he feel stress and resign without finding job. when my family know about this, they don't like and start with their objection on this relationship again. Despite all this,  I try to hold on to this long 6 years relationship, I try to talk to my bf to solve on the issue we have. Told him why future is important, he mentioned he just want to work no stress work and he feel that his parent can go through this last time so he can do the same too. Whatever he say I could endure and willing to find way to overcome to maintain this 6 years rs. But recently when I ask him to try to convince my parent to accept him, he told me if I cannot convince, he convince also no use. why need to be so unhappy as family is important. Long story short,  me and the bf officially broke up recently as he not willing to convince my family despite how much I could accept that he want to work no stress job and have no much plan for future. I feel quite emotional of this rs since we have been together for sometime. I just hope to get some advice to hold on to fight for this rs or move on to another person.

96209,"Hi admin, please post this...I need to hear opinion from others so I can decide on the next step of my career. With all the previous posts about pharmacy-related matters, I’m currently working in one of the statutory boards. We were also given side projects, which the boss mentioned “it would be good if you could take it up”. I would have interpreted this as not compulsory for me to take them up if I don’t wish to. The other colleagues also told me that I don’t have to take up these side projects if I’m not aiming for promotion. Apparently, our main job is already quite hectic, so these side projects can only be done outside of office hours. Furthermore, we don’t get paid for OT and neither are we allowed time-off even if we were to stay back and do these extra stuff. Just to clarify, I like this job enough to do in the long term, but not enough for me to sacrifice my free time to work more as my main priority is work-life balance.Thus, I can say that I’m indeed not aiming for promotion as my current priority is work-life balance, so I decided that I’ll just do my main job and ignored all side projects. As a result, the boss seems unhappy with me. Recently, I felt like my direct superior is pushing me to take up a side project via the passive aggressive way eg chasing me for the results every now and then and asking me to hurry, even though I was already very busy with my main job. Obviously I would prioritise my main job and leave the side project to the last minute as the project is supposedly optional. So my question is this: is it actually an unspoken rule that one is expected to take up some side projects, even if you’re not aiming for promotion? Or it depends on the boss one has?-#96209: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96209","['Like: 6 people', 'Care: 5 people', 'Haha: 1 person']",9 Comments,1 Share

96204,"i’m a 24M student, single for life. seeing friends BTO or getting attached, discussing their future or even setting up a family. i’m quite stressed out on how should i plan out my future, such as when to settle down and get a gf etc. I talked to my friends and most of em have different circumstances and doesn’t seem to apply to me. i’ve always been a goal driven person, planning out my financials and even hobby, filling my days with activities such as studying or hitting the gym, reading books or just doing some side job buy and sell etc. i’m not born with a golden spoon, i have to plan my own expenses (student loan and daily expenses etc  )and get my own money, such as doing part time job etc. basically, self sufficient. so here’s the main point , how do people my age actually manage to get themselves a partner while being able to study and spend so much money (dating etc)? if i were to do the same i would be spending my time working part time, spending my night studying and working myself off. i’ve been thinking if getting a partner would actually be a financial burden to myself, to the extent of affecting my studies.Note: yes, it seems like i’m unable to get out of my comfort zone, i just wanna see how people think and what’s their approach in life in order to get some motivation.should i be actively seeking for a partner now? or just chill out until i graduate?

96203,"Hi everyone,I am about to graduate from NUS computing. It took me until graduation to discover my interest in finance and economics specifically investment-related. I used to study accounting back before university but did not have such a strong interest/passion for it back then. Other than that, I have passed M5, M9, M9a, HI exams in my previous pursuit to become a financial consultant (long story short, it didn't work out and I didn't like the style of work). I have been reading up a lot on investment on my own and I would say I know the basics though I do not have much investment experience yet.Is there any entry-level investment-related roles I can take that can allow me to have some working experience and gain more relevant knowledge? Or is there any route you can recommend for me to take? I do not mind doing research or other excel spreadsheet types of tasks as an initial entry into the industry. My idea is to accumulate experience and knowledge to be able to eventually be promoted to higher roles. Recently, I saw some jobs as an investment analyst/associate which recommend employees to take the CFA exam within 2-3 years. I know that CFA is known to have a lower passing rate than other certificate-based examinations. What are your thoughts/personal experience on this? Feel free to chip in any advice or insights that might be useful. Thanks!!-#96203: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96203","['Like: 6 people', 'Care: 1 person']",8 Comments,0 Shares
96192,"My boyfriend and I have a huge difference in sleeping patterns and ever since I started working full time, I feel like it’s beginning to take a toll on our relationship. He has the habit of sleeping at wee hours in the morning (5-6am) whereas I am usually asleep by 12am. This means that he only wakes up around 2-3pm (even on days we plan to meet) and by that time, half the day is over for me, since I have to get up early the next day for work. Our weekly dates have since become super routine, in a sense that we only spend about 2 hours just hanging out before having dinner and then going home. It makes me feel as if I am the one causing our dates to be like this since I have to be home early. I have spoken to him about the issue but he feels that it is not a problem and he always promises to fix his sleep schedule but never does it. There was once we made plans to meet at 11am and  he only woke up at 2pm. I was pretty angry because I made the effort to be there on time only to feel like I was being stood up. And when he finally woke up, he didn’t understand why I was so angry as it was just a small matter to him. Sometimes I even think back and wonder why I was so dumb to actually continue waiting there for 3 hours - until he called back. I have no idea if such a difference is a red flag? Or a sign that maybe we are really not that compatible.. or I am just not important enough for him to compromise-#96192: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96192","['Like: 33 people', 'Sad: 9 people', 'Haha: 3 people']",31 Comments,11 Shares
96191,"SoC doesn't teach web or mobile development and the argument is that these can be easily learnt online, and these tech move so fast that the content become outdated soon.However, every other focus area content can also be easily learnt online by the student. The core modules are good as it is and teach the fundamentals. However, couldn't there be a web or mobile development focus area? Or even frontend or backend focus area. I don't see why that is a bad thing. We already have Software Engineering focus area where they teach you basic principles of SE. Security where they teach u fundamentals of cybersecurity. Etc. Why can't there be a frontend or backend focus area where they teach you the fundamentals of these areas?At the end of the day, why must we hold the argument that you can teach yourself web development. Why can't SoC also teach web development since this teach yourself argument also applies to every mods. Why not teach something that many students will directly apply after they graduate? Why only teach theory stuff that only those who venture into research will find useful? After your graduate, many of these theories that you learn will be forgotten anyway. Why don't we translate these rigour spent on these theory mods into rigour spend on practical mods? I'm not saying to teach only web or mobile development. Maybe have a few mods where students can take to satisfy as breadth? Why isn't this a good thing?-#96191: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96191","['Like: 8 people', 'Wow: 1 person']",6 Comments,0 Shares
96189,"I need advice for donated bursaries. I don't get the question that's asked ""what difficulties do you face in your daily life"". I actually don't know what to say, there's no difficulties, except for the school fees that I may not be able to pay once I graduate - loan (actually is can one if work for 4 or 5 years, including paying off interests, which is why I'm not sure if this can be used as an answer, but the bursary would definitely help in paying off some of it). I live in a 2-room flat with a family of 4. Even though our family income is about $2k, I have a roof over my head, we cook everyday hence food is cheaper, that's all. We have food and shelter. We've never gone out to eat because, frugal. Going out with friends aren't allowed because food outside costs money. And that is very normal for me. Are these considered difficulties, it sounds trivial to me? I don't understand what difficulties I'm supposed to say? Am I supposed to lie and tell a sob story, like oh we don't get to eat on some days? Or the size of our HDB isn't satisfactory (sounds like a privileged thing to say)?-#96189: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96189","['Like: 23 people', 'Care: 9 people']",7 Comments,6 Shares
96187,"To #96179, #96157 and #96177I've only had about 2 ex bfs and I'm now engaged. My fiancé is definitely smaller than my second exbf (A), but he's still bigger than my first ex (.My sex life is still decent now, I occasionally don't fake it - but I still end up pretty unsatisfied most of the time compared to when I was with A. At the risk of TMI, A was unreasonably large that some days that it would be hard to fit him. Think something like 6""+ on an average day. In comparison, my fiancé is a little around half of A. You can go figure how sad my first sexual experiences with B were from that.The thing is, even though the sex isn't that great, I'd still say I'm keeping him for his other redeeming qualities. I figure that he as a person is exactly my type of person and he in specific is the person I want to marry. He's not rich, doesn't earn that much above average, but he's a great guy and I'll stand by him.I do agree that I'm less willing to initiate or agree to sex with my fiance since I don't particularly find it very enjoyable, and I find my sex drive has kinda tapered off over the course of this relationship. Don't get why people are so up in arms about someone saying that they're not like, *super enthusiastic* over an activity they don't really enjoy. We don't have sex that often but we do other things together and overall have a good time in each others' company.I guess it depends on whether you can look past the sex life, or if it's really that much of a dealbreaker for you. For me it felt like 80% of the relationship at first, since the contrast to A was really quite obvious in terms of frequency and enjoyment, but eventually I guess we found other things to do that made up for it in the long term. I can't say that it's 20% of the relationship now, even after 7 going on 8 years, but I guess we have to work towards it. And anyway I got together with him for who he is and not what his member feels like.I'll state the obvious - if you're not happy in the relationship, and if you think something in the relationship isn't working, it's fair enough to break up. The relationship is about both of you, so if someone is unhappy and can't work past that unhappiness, the relationship won't work in the long run anyway. I'd caution against talking to your boyfriends about this, since this isn't exactly a problem that can be ""solved"", if you do want to bring it up, please be sensitive about it and try not to hurt their egos when talking about it.Good luck and may you find happiness, sis!-#96187: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96187","['Like: 45 people', 'Haha: 7 people', 'Care: 3 people']",11 Comments,4 Shares
