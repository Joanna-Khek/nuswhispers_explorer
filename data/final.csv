101093,"tldr: what to do with my father? basically the situation is that my father has managed to, through his behaviour and actions (toxic, emotional blackmail, manipulative, etc), managed to alienate himself from the whole family. in fact I suspect he has borderline personality disorder. my mother is now doing her best to avoid seeing and interacting with him at all by coming back from work as late as possible, and is planning on divorce. not trying to be unfilial or anything, but I too am planning to move out after I get a job and have some income, because of the mental turmoil he keeps subjecting me to. seriously, because I'm the only child and he has no friends, he confides everything in me, even random crap like how my mother doesn't want to be physically intimate with him (which doesn't sound like something a son should even care about), and always coercing me to unlock my mother's phone so that he can read through her messages to see if she is cheating. and he always presents severe signs of stress and desperation which causes me a lot of stress at home too. therefore, as much as I don't want to leave him alone, I believe I have no choice because I should prioritize my mental health. all I hope for is for him to be able to lead a dignified life when he eventually lives alone. currently my plan is to help him to change to a job where he can be more active and make new friends (e.g. something like social worker? although I doubt it will work cos he's a very cynical and unsympathetic person). this can help improve his physical health and also give him a social net so that he doesn't have to turn to me for everything. but the problem with this approach is that he's uneducated (which limits the jobs he can apply to) and he is extremely reluctant to change. so now basically I have no other ideas about what to do with him. I'm not so keen on sending him to the old folks home cos he can currently still be independent and old folks home will burn my wallet quite badly. is there any use sending him for mental therapy? I feel like there may not be a point since there's a good chance he might not be receptive or he may simply just pass away before his problems are fixed. my father has honestly led a rather tough life, how do I prevent my father from living his final years full of bitterness and vengeance after we ""abandon"" him?-#101093: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101093","['Sad: 3 people', 'Like: 1 person']",0 Comments,4 comments
101090,Just a rant. Is it true that guys discuss their female friends' bodies among themselves or is it just me being suay to have met this kind of friends.. One of my guy friends told me they talked among themselves about girls' bodies like who has the biggest cup size or nicest body or butt. Who knows what goes through their minds when they talk to us lol. And he still had the audacity to tell me about it. PS I immediately distanced myself and ended friendship with this friend because I don't need one who's a wolf in sheep's clothing.-#101090: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101090,"['Haha: 28 people', 'Like: 21 people', 'Care: 8 people']",56 comments,2 shares

101086,"After reading many posts here, it's come to my attention that guys really don't know how to treat girls. We see many girls coming here hurt and lost because their boyfriends / husbands are insensitive and don't give them the attention they deserve, or are disloyal, or act childish and entitled. It seems that men around here really don't understand how women think and feel, or are just immature or inconsiderate. We almost don't see any posts that go the other way round, it's always women who are giving their all and getting hurt in return in relationships.All we're asking is some sensitivity to our needs. It's not that hard. Guys, you can do better. You should do better. We deserve it.-#101086: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101086","['Haha: 20 people', 'Like: 16 people']",53 comments,5 shares
101084,"I have been in my current job for about 1.5 years and am planning to switch companies next year. Career progression wise seems stagnant as the department is relatively new and has no budget/headcount for permanent roles. 80% of the team is made up of outsourced employees who have been promised the prospect of a permanent role but being offered contract renewals time and again. Tbh, I’m only staying for the company name and experience that can help me to secure a good opportunity when I start job hunting at the end of this year. However, the past few weeks have been so crazy that I have the thought of just dropping my resignation immediately. Turnover rate has been an all time high with no replacements being hired. I have been doing the job of 3 people for the past few months without a salary increase. When they saw how well I was managing between jobs, it seemed like they forgot they were in the process of hiring a replacement. My colleagues who were fortunate enough to remain doing the 1 job they are paid for talked to me about evenly distributing the workload for the job function we have in common. It’s crazy how realistic some people can be and still talk about teamwork. Even if I’m not duly compensated for the additional work, it’d be nice to at least have supportive colleagues.-#101084: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101084",['Like: 16 people'],0 Comments,5 comments

101071,"I only feel romantic but not family love. How? I know I’m wrong. I feel guilty and ashamed of myself for being this way but I don’t feel any love towards my family. I have been overseas for exchange, grad trip, and I didn’t feel sad when I said goodbye to my parents at all. I can’t relate to family love films like “hi mom” in 2021 about how mums love their daughters, and I didn’t feel anything when I watched “my sisters keeper” about a mum losing her daughter to death. Every time I suspect I am incapable of human emotions, I know I’m the complete opposite when it comes to romantic love. I bawled my eyes out watching several love movies. Even reading a short romance story sends tears flowing down my cheeks. I have cried listening to sappy romance songs and even cried at touching online proposals. I have cried over breakups but I never shed a tear when my family members passed away. I cry buckets when someone’s boyfriend dies (or just does something touching) in a movie but feel hard as stone when it comes to mother-child relationships and losses in movies and novels. I just intellectually know which part should be sad and logically know where I “should” cry (and I’m right, everyone else cries at family movies) but even if it happens to me right now, I don’t feel sad. I don’t feel anything remotely close to “love” when I see my mum no matter how much she sacrificed for me. My brain says I should love her but my heart doesn’t beat. Im not cold blooded, look at all my tears shed at all the romance. And yes my mum really loves me but the glitch in my brain stops me from loving her the same way I love my boyfriend no matter how hard I try. Are your feelings towards your mum and boyfriend the same? Are you supposed to love your mum in the same way as you love your boyfriend?

101068,"TLDR Story: Invested 2 years my life in the girl, took the risk to confess to the person who was already in a relationship due to the girl constantly probing me on whether I liked her, got rejected after giving my answer, she requested to continue to be friends, I agreed. Still continues to go out with the close friend group and one on one sessions with the girl.It has been 8 months since the confession...now and then I would feel trapped and burdened....as I would need to keep silent and display a smile when going out with the group. Sometimes I will feel affected...when the girl talks about her bf in a group setting to my other friends as nothing happened, where it would cause me to feel that I would want to leave the group so I do not have to face all this anymore...However, I would suppress all these thoughts...as I cherish this group of friends and constantly remind myself to outweigh keeping this friendship vs being together with the girl.Would you give up a close friend group, because you missed a shot with someone you liked in the group and the person is already attached?-#101068: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101068","['Like: 11 people', 'Haha: 1 person', 'Sad: 1 person']",16 comments,2 shares

101083,"At first glance, no one would be able to tell anything was wrong with me. I'm a very successful graduate student. Most people think quite highly of me. As much as possible I put on a brave face.The truth is, I'm falling apart everyday and I'm barely holding it all together. And I'm on my own. I have only a few friends with whom I'm close enough to seek support from. One of them only cares about talking about themselves and is constantly being extremely negative, which just makes things worse for me when I'm already barely keeping it together. Another one can be nice at times but is cold at other times. And I worry that I'll annoy this person too much if I keep bothering them so I try not to, especially since I've always gone to them with my problems in the past. They have their own problems to deal with, and they could be tired of me already.So I suppress everything because there's no one I can seek support from. I try to deal with everything myself, like an adult should. But I'm at my limits and I just don't know what else I can do. I'm trying very hard and often I wish I had just some simple support. I don't need anything special. Just simple words of encouragement occasionally, or just someone who genuinely cares enough to check in on how I'm doing once in a while. It's hard. I'm trying my best but it doesn't seem to be enough. I'm starting to feel passively suicidal, not so much in the sense of wanting to off myself since I don't want to make my family sad. But I'd be relieved if it ends. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. I have to, but I just don't know how.-#101083: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101083","['Like: 30 people', 'Care: 17 people']",27 comments,1 share

101075,"Anyone been with a narcissistic person who tends to gaslight and manipulate you? My ex and I have been talking about getting back together but I realised that he doesn’t take responsibility his wrongdoings. 1. I always hear stuff like ‘it’s ok, I’m wrong, you’re right ok? you’re always right’ when I’m trying to communicate properly calmly.2. Because I’ve had a hookup phase, and I have a lifting account, he says stuff like ‘you’re just going to make friends with them because you want to f*** them. That’s all you do anyway.’ and he said he was conscious when he said these, he said it to purposely trigger me. 3. I told him that when we broke up, and he emotionally manipulated me by throwing the suicide card and pinning it on me, he doesn’t apologise for the hurt he caused. Instead, he says that he went suicidal cus I chose to break up.4. Ranted to my friend about our rs. He saw it and flipped. Said I shouldn’t tell anyone about what happens between us because rs is between your partner and you.5. He isn’t someone to reflect on his mistakes and when I communicate, he gets angry.He has nice qualities. He puts in effort for me, he is protective of me and he loves me. My mum loves him too.

It was really tough meeting sg guys whom are willing to accept someone of my height and I want to keep it this way to go for sg guys since I still want to keep myself real instead of faking myself with fake english and all. Eww. So recently, I fell in love with this guy I met online few months ago, we starting meeting up, do some dating & couple things together. He is really smart, good career, well built, and heads to yoga & gym along with me. But the height was an issue to him because he is a 168cm. He also told me that he belong to the smaller side. I told him it is fine, I will still treat him like a king, my own king. I understand from my sisters that girls need to constantly rub guy's ego, so I really tried everything to do that. But, last night on NY was a shocker to me. We did the deed and I am shocked that his thing is the size of my pinky finger!! Literally 3cm full erected & its not even thick at all. Although my pool of sg guys wasn't a lot, but from the data i gathered together with my sisters, sg guys have a max of up to 15cm or footlong. But hell.. why am I seeing this.

101051,"How do I deal with a husband who live in his own world?I married to my husband at 2018 and everything is good at the starting until he decided to run F&B business at 2020.He have no idea the amount of salt & sugar for the cooking but he make a decision to open the business with his friend(from decide to grand opening less than 6 months) but unlucky his friend also not a cook person so due to cannot see he fail I decide to help him and all the nightmare start. He is not a details person, so by-force I need to take care of the ordering part with supplier & train the staffs with daily operation running. And my job not end with this, after finished at outlet I still need to continue check my staff to cook at central kitchen. He is basically deal the apps & marketing & drive grab to cover monthly expenses. And he said business just starting so he only can pay me S$2500 a month for my work, after minus CPF left S$2k on hand. He never ask me pay for house but as in wife I will still buy my daughter needs & others stuffs.At Aug 2021, he keep bring me & my in law to do the house viewing. Then I ask him is it he wanted to buy a new house but he said just viewing only, because he use to see property video so I trust his word. We see a few condo and he ask my opinion, then 9/7/2021 he bring me see 1 of the condo at the east coast and the salesgirl told him the price will increase on the 12/7/2021. After viewing he seem like really get into and we sign the agreement of purchase at the midnight on 11/07/21. At the time our previous house haven get buyer and the new house only complete by 2023 so in very rush we sell house and move to rented condo. He is that kind of person who cannot listen to objection and I told him I haven ready to this big buy but he said no need me to pay, just help him pay maintenance fee is good enough. Then on Sept 2021, he not end his dream yet. He decided to open another outlet at heartland mall but all the shit still count on me. The most he deal with the renovation team but setup is done by me & my team. At this moment I already exhausted and my emotional is not so stable, I easy get angry and no more patience to deal with my surround things. After I setup done with new outlet he give me another ""SURPRISE"",he said I always ask for dog (which is before I help him in business & have my daughter) he get me a 2.5 month puppy on the Christmas. I already tell him I have no confident to take care of so many thing but he choose to ignore my word, and he roles in family just sit down watch TV & check on his phone, sleep & shit in the toilet. Not much interactive between him, my daughter & me plus the puppy. And we quarrel a lot for all this and he said I got anger management issue, and to proof him that he is wrong I book the psychology counselling session. After done the counselling session, the psychologist said I have no anger management issue just I overwork and I feel lost and insecure to all his decision. And my husband also not the kind of sweet talk person, since day 1 we married until now only have 1 Apple Watch as in present gift and if I ask for more he will said he already provide me house, wifi, Netflix & give me a lady boss title. He mean I no need work like last time need punch card and can be more flexible (which is really 24/7 no end kind), And he also said he provide everything so the S$2000 salary is enough for me to spend.But as in wife I know his stingy character so when the outlet no need me, I still will go do part time nurse to get extra income. Now I'm the dilemma should I ask for divorce since my effort is not been appreciated by him and the most important issue is I dunno what kind of surprise he will give me in future.-#101051: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101051","['Like: 46 people', 'Haha: 26 people', 'Care: 14 people']",43 comments,24 shares

I've been feeling overwhelmed and I get very irritated, angry and frustrated. My husband helps a lot in taking care of the household and kid while inside of me just wanna cry frequently. Idk if I'm slipping into some kind of depression. Sometimes I can be positive and happy when my child is at home. But I drag the feeling of picking my lo back home. I'm always triggered by several things like non stop playing during meal times, taking hours to eat then refusal to put books and toys back to the original spots. And the most triggers I have are relatively new toys where some parts are deliberately misplaced and forgotten by LO when I already asked that it's placed back to the original place. I've bought many of the books and toys and it eeks me that within matter of mins, some parts get thrown around and it's a junkyard every night. Husband helps to keep but I've told him not to do it alone. It has to be with LO together so he learns to do it habitually. And then LO would refuse to bath, brush teeth, go pee, get changed etc. The mornings are my super angry moments daily when I try to prepare LO for school. LO would play immediately once awake or watch TV with his grandma. Then nagging to brush teeth is like me having to threaten to let his teeth rot or no breakfast if there's not enough time. I even meanly let him go to school without breakfast and he's ok. ????????????????????????I feel such a horrible parent and I've tried from gentle parenting to tiger parents and LO just don't respond or do as told.

He has always been there for me during tough times. He also used to accompany me to bring my dad to hospital and appointments before my dad passed away.  However, he always speaks bluntly and rudely to elderly like my family members (he also does the same to his family members). Like for example if an elderly member does something wrongly or believes something that is wrong or fake, he’ll straight up correct them. If he’s angry or upset with whatever the elderly has said or done, he doesn’t hesitate to show or express it (very often very rudely). He will also tries to inform the elderly of the correct thing to do. I’ve talked to him about this before but he feels that he’s just being straightforward and that respect for elderly is not a default thing but that the elderly should also earn the respect. This bothers me a lot and it has often put me in difficult situations. I feel that there is no point in arguing or trying to change an elderly’s mindset since they’re usually very stubborn due to different upbringing during their time. Furthermore, I’m also brought up in a way to show respect to elderly even if they’re in the wrong. So I find it very hard or stress when he talks so bluntly to my family members. I feel that’s it’s not wrong to try to correct them or show them that he’s upset but at least should still have some manners or like say it in a nicer toner. Because of this, my family members dislike him a lot. Am I being silly for being affected so much by this?

101036,"During the recent festive seasons, I realise how profit-driven f&b companies are at the expense of their employees, grab delivery riders, and even customers. From the Collin’s grill incident which customers waited hours for nothing and the company faces bad press, to my own experiences facing long waiting time at home for my food to arrive, to also facing long hours self-picking up food at the restaurant, they have me reflecting and thinking critically on the business models of IT companies like Grab and also restaurant business. How can we circumvent these issues in future festive occasions where we are over-promised but the companies under-delivered? In case you are wondering, there was zero customer service support on Grab.Looking at the grab drivers waiting in the rain during festive occasion for an hour for food outside a restaurant, snubbed by both people at the restaurant and the customers who received the food late, coming forward how can we improve their work experiences? And who is laughing to the bank in these festive seasons? Grab and the bosses of most f&b companies. Accepting orders but not adequately staffing their food outlets.I hope 2022 will be a better year for people working during festive seasons. And let’s all be more understanding and grateful to our food delivery riders.-#101036: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101036","['Like: 48 people', 'Care: 15 people']",14 comments,1 share

101032,"getting rejected when you are unsure of the outcome hurts but you expected it. you know its a 50% chance and you chose to take the chance. when the hurt is anticipated you recover faster. but getting rejected after being led on, is a whole new level of pain. it has been almost 6 months since the rejection and i still could not get over the pain. there were so many things that you said/did that made me felt like there was something. which gave me the courage to say those words. but then you told me ""lets continue to be friends, i am not looking for a relationship now"". you said those words as though you are doing me a favour. if you want to do me a favour, don't act like that from the start. when a guy is interested in being a friend, he doesn't act like the way you do. this rejection has affected me rather badly, now i don't even have the confidence to meet other guys. i don't think i will ever dare to express my feelings to anyone again. i don't even want to get close to a guy now because what if he just wants to be my friend. you fucked with my mind and you pretended that nothing happen.-#101032: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101032","['Like: 24 people', 'Care: 19 people', 'Sad: 4 people']",28 comments,4 shares

101029,"2021 definitely was not a good year for me. January 2021 - I lost my grandma during the pandemic and was stuck overseas as borders were still shut. I had a very close relationship with my grandma so not being able to be by her side when she passed on was heartbreaking to say absolute least. Up till now, I'm still having a hard time letting her go and I still think of her every single day. February 2021 - My mum decided to file for divorce with my dad. Being the eldest of 5 kids, I was constantly caught in their turmoil of arguments (through WhatsApp) and it eventually had an impact on me as I saw myself getting more temperamental and frustrated easily. Every single day, I would receive WhatsApp texts from both my Mum and Dad separately, which entailed screenshots of their private conversations which held their arguments. This happened when I am still overseas. Dad was still trying his very best to make amendments  in salvaging their marriage but my mum was just having none of it. May 2021 - Had a heated conversation with my 2 closest friends in Singapore. They've been urging me to return home as I have not seen them in 2 years. However I refused to because I don't like it in Singapore and I don't foresee myself working in SG long-term as I personally find the working culture to be too toxic (just my own view). They then went on to say I am not cherishing what I have and I should not even call myself a Singaporean. I asked them to give me 3 legit reasons why I should return to Singapore for good and all they could say was ""So we can meet up more often."" To me, that reason should not even be considered a ""reason to return home"". I then told them the reason why I don't want to return to Singapore is - There are a lot of small minded people, the work culture is toxic and people can never be happy for one another. I am very happy with my current work situation overseas and if they are my true friends, they should be happy for me as well. Over the months I started to drift apart from them and we stopped talking ever since. The rest of the year has been pretty meh since I lost majority of my social circle and I fell into depression. I didn't really have anyone to talk to and was extremely suicidal to the point that I was so tempted to jump and say bye bye once and for all. Right now, I don't know what I am living for. The people that were once important to me aren't in my life anymore, the happy family I once had is falling apart. Everyday I just question, how much longer do I have to do this?-#101029: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101029","['Care: 54 people', 'Like: 23 people', 'Sad: 16 people']",25 comments,4 shares

Yet, I can't help but feel insecure and doubtful all the time.My bf works in a big company with many young female employees our age, there is a good mix of males and females but my bf is one of the younger males there.Within 6 months of working there, I had to hear stories of 5-6 different girls hitting on him, and how his other male colleagues are always flirting because they find many girls in his company very pretty and hot. I'm not bad looking and I get my fair share of guys doing double takes, but I'm not those popular pretty and slender girls you see on Tiktok, which makes me feel very inferior whenever he tells me one of the ""supposingly very pretty"" girls in office is flirting him. He tells me these things and then says that he doesn't care and he never talks to them but it bothers me a lot because he does look quite happy being popular among girls in the office. One of them even asked him for sex knowing that he has a gf... She has a bf too. Of course, he told me he didn't and he always updates me with his whereabouts and replies my texts very quickly. Even when he is so wholesome and such a good man, I still feel scared all the time. One of the reasons is because he has a high sex drive that my low sex drive cannot satisfy... so I often wonder if he'll go get laid outside because I can't meet his needs. But then again, he has always been honest and there isn't a time he doesn't send me video messages on tele about his whereabouts so my fears are really irrational..Help?-#101012: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101012","['Like: 57 people', 'Haha: 20 people', 'Care: 10 people']",45 comments,5 shares

101025,"How do I deal with a lazy and overly frugal boyfriend?My boyfriend and I have a very loving relationship and we are about to get married. After reading this, in case some of you think I should leave him, that's not an option because of his other superb traits (caring, kind, cheerful) that are actually more than enough for me. But I'm at a loss to do when it comes to how lazy and overly frugal he is. We are both in the tech industry and he's making multiples of the average salary for his age and has attained quite a lot of achievements over the years. These achievements are due to his hard work and definitely didn't come by chance. I know people will say he's probably lazy because he has already attained success. But the thing is, he's also extremely frugal and by no means believes that his current state is already ""success"". In fact, we hardly eat anything expensive and would even scrimp on toilet paper and shampoo because he still thinks we are poor and will run out of money. He would complain when I want to treat us to holidays together, or eat out. He would check the receipts of things I buy and scrutinize their cost. He would insist we switch off all the lights in the house and make it look super gloomy all the time to save on electricity bills. I find this draining because it deeply conflicts with my own beliefs. Over the years, I started to realise that life is very short and time is the most valuable. So I want to spend time doing things I enjoy and experiencing everything life can offer, especially when we are still young and energetic. Besides this, I don't believe that saving cost is the way to ensure we have money in the long-term. Rather than cost, we should find ways to generate income and in a sustainable manner. As such, I wake up very early in the morning to work on our side projects before work, and tried negotiating with him that all our passive income can be used to fund a better lifestyle. So far, we have already made enough to cover our monthly expenses. However, despite my attempts, he still continues to be overly frugal. He also does not work on our side projects at all, and a lot of them are at a standstill because he spends his days lying on the bed looking at his phone, or playing games on his computer for more than 7 hours a day. I've tried many times to reason with him, using all kinds of logic, but it doesn't work. I can live with this, I can still marry this guy, but I really don't understand why he has become like that and how I should help him.

Why not be upfront and tell them that it is because they don't want you taking up hospital bed should you get infected or just mandating it upright. Everyone know that the real reason the measures are in the place to 'force' the unvaccinated to be vaccinated as much as possible and prevent hospital beds from running out and while I am supportive of that, I find the reasons they give extremely obnoxious and disingenuous.

Whenever my dates said things like ""you're great, but I guess things don't really work out for us"" or ""thanks for the date, I appreciate everything, but I guess it's best if we just stay as friends"", I tend to feel disappointed and kept putting all the blame on myself for not being good enough for them.

There is a neighbourhood cat at the void deck. According to my observations it is well fed and loved by all other neighbours. I frequently see people petting it or feeding it.However, there seems to be a problem between me and the cat. The first time we came across each other, I was sitting on a bench waiting for my friends. Suddenly I heard a meow. I turned my head and saw it gazing at and walking towards me. I am very afraid of cats, so I slowly moved away from the bench. Then I realised there are cat food underneath that bench. I thought it's just that I crossed its territory.Ever since then, every time I linger around the void deck (either waiting for friends or doing exercises) it will come out of nowhere and scream at me. If I simply walk away to another spot within the void deck, it'll just keep following me until I leave. Initially it was still okay, cuz I can just move away. But tonight as I was walking away, it quietly stalked me and then suddenly charged at me.  I'm not sure what it is that made the cat hate me so much. Could it be my scent(I had a hamster before I moved out)? Or could it be what people say ""cats can sense fear""? What can I do in this situation? This is a cat that's well loved by neighbours, I feel getting rid of it is not an option. I also can't possibly avoid the void deck totally cuz I have to walk past it if I want to go out.

100999,"It’s honestly so exhausting to live in a family with parents who chose to have children for the sole purpose of their own benefit in old life. Growing up, my parents barely provided me with any guidance. All they pushed me to do was to study hard, get good grades and be able to finish a university education. Yet, throughout my school life, they have never helped me to achieve what they wanted for me. Being able to graduate with a degree was all because of my own hard work (I guess the only thing they did was pay for my education but then again they saw it as an investment for their old age) They never even provided me with a home that was conducive for studying since they would be quarrelling all the time over every small thing. I remember as a child, their fights got so bad that it left a trauma for the longest time. And the moment I graduated, I was rushed to get a full time job. Once I started my job, all eyes were on my money. I was expected to not only contribute to household expenses but also pay for what my younger sibling wants to get/eat. When I got a promotion and a big raise, I 100% regretted telling my parents about it. Their eyes lit up as if they just won the lottery. Immediately after, they started listing their expectations from me with the new salary I got. YES, you may have paid for my necessities until I became independent but isn’t that what being a parent entails? They always make it seem like I owe them. I was the one who worked hard at this job to get a promotion. When I confronted them about it, their words left me speechless. They said the sole reason they chose to have so many children was so that they would have someone to help them with everything and provide them with lots of money for retirement. They have no planning done for their retirement and want to depend on my siblings and I. What kind of parents don’t care that their children have their own future family / dreams to pay for?

At first I thought that just letting things flow and go the way as it is will be the best decision I can make, but my heart still can't move on from it. Long story short, I've been liking a close friend of mine since secondary school. And I've tried confessing to him not once but twice and both times his answer is rather ambiguous. Like at first he said we can give it a try, but I see there's no difference after that.  I tried asking again whether is it possible for the both of us to be more than just close/bestfriend? and his answer was, nothing is impossible. I'm like..........????? I want an exact answer just yes/no but he keep making me guessing about it. After me confessing to him,he still treat me the usual way as he has always been. When we go out to eat and stuff. Also he sent me back home if we went out till late night. He treat me so good that it got me confused by thinking is there hope? But when we talked, just a normal bestfriends kind of talk, he shows that I'm just a friend to him and nothing more. The way he talk in our conversations and the choice of words he used, just shows that he think of me as just friend and nothing more. But here I am being all stupid, getting my hopes high again after each of our meetups. I really want to get rid of this stupid/foolish kind of feelings I'm having right now. But it is just so hard, especially after our meetups. I don't want to lose him as friend either but is just my heart that can't stop having feelings for him. It hurts so much knowing and seeing that eventhough he treat me so good but at the end of the day the possibility of us being together is just not there. Like, I've tried my very best to get rid of this feeling, but it's just so hard for me. Especially when I have to act like I'm fine, I'm ok whenever we go out together and he also act like nothing happened as per normal, after I confessed to him. With him like that, is just making me feel like a fool for secretly having hopes again each time. I just can't. Like, I really need to get rid of this feeling. For now, I just trying my very best to just focus on my work and nothing else. But I can't help it but to wait for his messages whenever I'm at work. I will keep on looking at my phone waiting for his messages which he will only reply after hours. And to add on, he will sometimes reply to my messages fast, sometimes few hours later, which he told me before that he won't be able to reply me that fast most of the time. Even after me know that he will only reply after few hours, and at times he will only reply 1 word or just 1 thing, but I will be the one that keep on sending him more messages. Like the more I sent him the lesser his replies or at times he will just reply to the last message that I sent and the rest he will not reply to it. Despite all of that, I still keep waiting and my heart still keep hoping. I just feel so stupid.

But I had a change of mind, and eventually told C that I'm not interested, and did not turn up at the client's place to sign the letter of appointment (LOA). 7 Nov: C dropped me an email to recover the cost and I continued to ignore. 16 Dec: C dropped me an email again to ask for preferred date & time for mediation and if I do not reply by the deadline given, C would commence legal proceedings against me.Here's an update on the case 27 Dec: I have filed a report to TAFEP against C. I have phone call mediation with C and C mentioned can only allowed 5% discount for lump sum payment or 3 months instalment. But I negotiated to 12 month installment or 50% goodwill discount.28 Dec: C dropped me an email that 12 months installment or 50% goodwill discount is rejected. C offered a 5 months instalment and first payment has to be paid by 29 Dec. However I dropped an email to insist on 12 months instalment29 Dec: C managed to approve the 12 months installment and to be paid by 30 Dec, if not C would commence legal proceedings against me. TAFEP dropped an email to C for investigation and C sent me an email to inform me not to pay for any installment to fully cooperate with TAFEP. Not even 2 hours later, I received an email from C about Small Claim Tribunal (SCT) against me. 30 Dec: I have made the 1st installment Anyone encounter this?-#100997: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100997","['Like: 6 people', 'Haha: 5 people', 'Wow: 5 people']",35 comments,6 shares
100996,"I have been working in a tech company as a SWE for around 2 years. Our company's practice is that the management will review and adjust the compensation and promote staff (if applicable) on the January of every year. For the past few weeks, I can't help but to think that if I can't get the promotion, I shall just leave the company to pump my salary. But if I stay longer, I might get that promotion next year and climb higher. I know this is quite a stupid question, but will appreciate it if anyone could tell me what to do if I don't get the promotion.

Sometimes I let the poor grab food driver shout outside the house in hopes that my sibling could hear but it never worked out. He would forget to switch off the lights after using or leave plastic bags around after retrieving the purchased items from them. Did I mention I have to keep the clothes in when it starts raining while he is sleeping or gaming? Yes, me. There is always someone to pick up after him which of course are my parents.

December is a month of intense emotional enhancement, where the Christmas period, school holidays, leave clearance, and incoming New Year all culminate into extra time for fun or unexpected solitude.Attached persons would feel especially heartened, with a warm hand to hold, and a soft body to hug.Friends would eat, drink and make merry, with plenty of catching up and late nights spent that invigorate the soul.The forgotten or late would contend with seeing all the happy smiles and joyful laughter, reminded of his/her own loneliness in a time that could be of cheer.Be that as it may, enjoy the company that you have, or the peace that you find yourself in. The new year is but a date, but we can all do better when the fireworks start. If you are happy, stay happy. If you are not yet where you want to be in life, let’s work towards what we can be.

100989,"Confessions of a crazy jealous gf.I'm not easily jealous to be honest. Usually I will give my man all the space and privacy that he needs but one day I just felt like smthg was 'off'.We would be getting intimate and he just looks disinterested and wasn't getting hard or wasn't finishing and I didn't understand why when it was all his favourite spots. Or I'd be saying smthg and his mind is elsewhere and obviously not paying attention.One day, I decided to 'fish' info out of him and asked him ""who do you love the most?"" Of which he said ""oh, i don't know, it's hard to choose. I like all of them."" (Oh so there's more than just me?)I couldn't sleep. He didn't wna talk. But I knew smthg was amiss so I did the unthinkable: I hacked into his phone to see his latest pictures (if anyone had been sending nudes). Then I went through his Instagram and Tinder and WA. Whilst I thought I'd find 1-2 girls, I found... tens! I was horrified. I was horrified bc just the night before he was telling me how much he cares about me and how I'm the only one and how he hasn't dated anyone as long as he has dated me (coming to about 1.5 years now).The worst part is, I got so crazy jealous that I actly downloaded his WA onto my computer and went thru all his messages. I know where the girls stay, where they work, how many kids they have, what they look like, their phone number etc. One girl with a tattoo down her leg actly stays across me. She supposedly went to his house multiple times for ""english classes"". Of which I found she had 'accidentally' left her notebook at his place. I know it's her bc she signed off with her real Viet name and my boyf is not Viet so that can't be his notebook. One day, I'm out at the mall and I see a girl who looks like her. I secretly took her picture as proof. I contemplated going up to her to bash her face up but I just had my nails done and didn't want to ruin it on her. Another night, we had just gone out for a date and on the way back, someone kept trying to call him at 9.30pm. I saw her name and recognized it as one of his ""fave"" girls to text. He saw that I saw and tried to play it off cool, ""well I'm definitely not picking 'that' up right now"".Anw, I confront him one night over the notebook. As expected, he tries to gaslight me back and says I'm fretting over ""small things/scrap evidence that doesn't matter"". I can't tell him that I know all this bc his phone has all the evidence we need. He admits to me he had a girl come over for English classes but she ""sat outside"" and they didn't get intimate whatsoever.I play dumb and go along with it. He doesn't need to know I'm still logged in to his WA. I know his every move, his schedule, where he's going to meet who and when and why. Is it wrong? Absolutely.The other day, during Christmas, his ""fave"" girl blocked him on Whatsapp. He sent a message to her that was single tick. I felt so happy inside! Yay, that bitch finally had the sense to back off my man!He didn't tell me about it, but I could tell from the way he was treating me in bed that he wasn't texting somebody else anymore. He was letting me stay over longer, we were going at it more frequently and longer. I don't think I'm crazy to think that I already knew smthg was up from the way things were in the bedroom. I'm still logged in to his WA but I think I'll log out bc... well, he's been a good boy and I can tell he ain't texting anyone else anymore. For now. So girls, if ur man is not showing much affection but suddenly spending a lot of money on you during dates then it's probably in compensation for him being a dick behind your back.And guys, if a girl finds out you're cheating/wandering around but she doesn't scream her head off at you, you should be afraid, you should be very afraid.-#100989: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100989","['Haha: 63 people', 'Like: 60 people']",76 comments,28 shares
100985,"To #100911I am in the same situation. For context, i was in a rlnship and had a bto with my ex but we broke up. Reading your post, i don't find you picky but more of looking for a husband material bf. In my case, my deal breaker was the emotional immaturity (of course both parties have faults as well). I was willing to stay by him and slowly guide him through but He wasn't willing to grow and bridge the gap, though i was. Even counselling cannot help. I spent countless nights in tears because i was so sad that we could have something great but it couldn't work out, it ended up affecting my work, my friendships etc. And plenty of sacrifices because he was not earning as much and i wanted to ensure that we have a sustainable future tgt. Until finally, under the encouragement of my friends, i took a step.Since the breakup, i no longer have to endure such hurt or pain and am actually excelling in my work again (previously my boss was worried as it was obvious my performance went down). I am getting a condo too on my own, when previously, i had to worry about him as well (since split ownership). Bobian, have to make lemonade out of lemons. Of course, like you, i worry about loneliness and being left on the shelf etc., but after this process, i realised, finding a correct partner is more important, regardless of age.Just want to let you know, plenty bash you for being picky or not staying by a man etc. Don't let that get to you. Being happy is the most important. My entire relationship looked like a fairytale on the surface but it was abusive emotionally and physically behind the scenes.For all those commenting on how she shld just tolerate or lower standards, let's be honest here. It is not a woman's job to make her man feel like a man. She is not a lifelong nanny to look after a man and guide him to grow or be better in whatever aspect or heal. And even if she does, lets face it, not every guy is willing to take that step. And yes, probably the good men are snapped up so we have to decide if we rather be alone and excel or deal with someone that potentially is a deadweight. I made my choice, jiayou! P.s.

100978,"I was contracted as a full time employee at this small company, K, under a 6 months probation. During the probation, the metal shutters of K broke down and jam when I closed it at the end of the day. However prior the day, the shutter was showing sign of wear and tear which was made known to my boss, S, multiple times but he did not get it fixed. Also, considering that the first person to leave for the day is supposed to shut the shutter but failed to do so and she just left the office thus I closed the shutter that day instead. When the shutter jammed and broke down, I informed S about it. S gotten it fixed, but he blamed it on me for spoiling the shutter instead with excuses such as my negligence in failing to ensure that the shutter shuts properly and as I was the person who last touches it. (If the girl who left first that day closes it, why would I need to last touch the shutter and carry the blame since it’s a shared responsibility for all staff to ensure that doors and shuttler are closed if they leave first) S told me to compensate for the fixing fee which is over 4K plus, I did not agree as it was not stated in my contract that I will need to compensate for any damage equipment of the company and considering I am still under probation. However he printed out a letter and pressured me to sign on that day to agree to 100 being deducted from my monthly salary for 10 months, after signing the agreement he did not gave me a copy of it for my keepsake. With the fear of losing my job and hoping to pass the probation, I signed the agreement. However in my 4th month I was dismissed over a mere complain from customer saying that I rejected customer request after working hours as I had already closed the door and was a few steps away from office (when there are other staff who had yet to leave the office whom could had assisted the customer). In the end I failed on my probation and my last pay was deducted of 800.

100977,"When did you decide whether to have children or not?I have been attached for close to two years now. Our relationship was built on the understanding that we'd get married eventually and start a family; my partner likes children very much. But for the past year, I have been considering if I actually don't want to be a parent after all. While I think it is meaningful to raise children and build a loving family, the sacrifices to be made are incredibly offputting. Having children requires so much commitment and responsibility, including financial cost, loss of personal time and freedom, the pressure to meet their emotional/developmental needs etc. As a female, there would also be physical changes and health risks I would have to deal with. People have told me that my views may change over time, especially when I get older. I also suspect that my reluctance to have children is because I haven't been able to do a lot of the things I want to do as a working adult yet, mainly travelling more and living independently. But the longer I drag this indecision out, the longer I'd be holding back my partner who could have used this time to find someone more compatible and start a family earlier. I haven't raised this with my partner seriously yet, because I want to be sure of my own position before engaging in a meaningful discussion with him. He is already clear on his stance and I don't expect to change his mind for my sake.Any thoughts please?

100976,"F**k! I just cheated again.....I know that there are many out there who are strongly against cheating and would shame those cheaters out there. Unpopular sentiment here, but I really feel for my man Wang Leehom, Raeesah Khan, Ryan Tan, Sylvia Chan and so on... As a guy, as a young person, as a human being, I feel that it is only normal to make mistakes in life. Of course, committing a wrongdoing at the expense of another's happiness is bad and I am not condoning a cheater's, liar, or any criminal's offences. But if we take a step back and realise that all of us are bound to sin and fall off our path of righteousness one day, wouldn't we hope that there would be people, or at least someone out there who would not only forgive us, give us a chance but guide us back to the road towards dignity and normalcy once more? I hope these simple thoughts of mine would inspire others to not immediately jump on the bandwagon to cancel, shame and ridicule those who have done wrong in their lives. How about trying to take on a different perspective and imagine that the person who have sinned is your loved one, your partner,  your parent, your sibling, your friend, your idol, your teacher, your senior, your child, or even.... yourself? How would you react? Would you still post mean, nasty, sarcastic jokes and comments about this sinner? Would you continue to share their mistakes to people around you and turn them into the next meme and laughing stock? Or would you do your best to speak out on their behalf, give them the benefit of the doubt, or if the situation is rather unmendable, would you forgive them and give them a chance to climb back up onto their feet to prove themselves and live a life they desire again?

100965,"I needed a place to rant. I have always envied friends with loving family because I felt my family is a huge chaos. My parents quarrel almost every other day, for the simplest thing you can think of. Their quarrels are so loud that I always felt my heart thumping fast and loud. I really hate myself for feeling this way, but I really hate my dad for his extremely toxic character. He is a big chauvinist, he always think he is right, if things didn’t go his way, he will be very angry and started shouting. He always feel the whole world owes him, and would express his unhappiness for people who are successful. Because of his character, he has not been working for the past 20 years, when he was in his early fifties. My elder sis was the one supporting the whole family expenses. Back then I was still in my primary school. I always recalled him scolding me when I switched on the lights at night to study. So, everyday I have to wake up very early, when he was still sleeping, on the bathroom light to study. I understand his concern was to save on electricity bill because his income had stopped. I just cannot understand why didn’t he put in effort to find a job then.My dad’s temper is so bad that his family members had not keep in touch with him ever since and he did not have any friends. Since young, he had always physically abuse my brother by punching him. My brother dreaded coming home and was a secondary school dropout. He learnt smoking, steals from people, and got easily triggered temper too. I always feel my dad had the biggest role to play in my brother going astray. Fast forward to today, dads temper had not improved a single bit, if any at all, it’s worsened. I really hate the way he talked to my mum, always finding faults at her and thinking he’s the right one.He is old now. Everytime I looked at him, tears will start to well up in my eyes. I really wanted so much to be filial to him, but I resent him so much. I feared him so much too. I know he is ageing, he lost weight, started having issues with eyes and legs. But everytime he shouts, it is still so loud and so vulgar. It’s as though the whole world owes him. I pray for the day when he starts being less toxic, be more grateful and with a better temper. So that his family will start caring for him.-#100965: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100965","['Care: 45 people', 'Like: 30 people']",6 comments,2 shares
100964,"Sorry this is gonna be quite long. I need some advice and needed some ranting.So i have this bf, we met on dating apps and we're together for 2 years now. I have been staying with him at his place ever since. We have been breaking up and patching multiple of times, and his problem is that he got trust issue with me, so everywhere i go i have to take photo for him.(with who, where i am at), live location, He will also have my whatsapp web on his phone. Mainly because when we ""break up"" i would download dating apps and use it thinking that we ""break"" and could never patch back again every single time. I did meet new people from the datings apps here n there. But JUST MAINLY to eat, nothing else i swear on my life. But my bf he don't believe, therefore he thinks that I cheated on him etc etc. In between those ""break n patch"" i've move back to my own place.But now is that i've given birth to a baby with him. Things still happen. Firstly, his house is like a zoo. There's BIRDS, FISH and DOGS.The hygiene isn't there at the first place. Well when you think thats maybe ok. His dogs (2 dogs) are not properly trained. They pee and shit everywhere in the living room. The birds take over the balcony and kitchen. Could you imagine cooking with the birds? Everything in the kitchen is covered with cling wrap all etc. And cmon how worst could it be right? THE ONLY WINDOW IS AT THE BALCONY. Can you imagine the smell?Before i even give birth i'm staying in his room all day like IMH patient. Now my baby do basically the same things as me. WAIT before yall say what why didn't i talk to him all. I SPOKE TO HIM BEFORE. His dogs very smelly, train his dogs all wait baby come out already whr to learn to crawl walk all. I told him i wanna move away or at least get a rental or sm shit.He told me. ""Now i don't have the money. I also going enlist already. Cnnt wait meh?"" Ya enlist. He's 23. Say he don't have the time to shower his dogs all come back take care baby. Guess what. Dogs belongs to him his but his mom  taking care for him buying food for the dogs all. Wow. Nvm i told him i'll go find jobs, there's people willing to help me take care baby. He say he don't trust me therefore i'm still here in his house. Waiting for him to bring back money when he didn't even have the responsibility, he work as delivery and only 4hr a day. I tried moved away, but he ended up threatening me. He going suicide all, baby is his everything (his family rs not good), I don't want my baby noy being able to see his father. At that point of time, i still do have feelings for him and i don't wanna lose him so i went back. but when i'm preg he kept claiming that baby not his all. FORCED me to abort, didn't really contributed when i'm preg. But wants everything.Secondly, his mom has the very traditional thinking. So everything that i do is WRONG TO HER. I'm now a shm. I gave my baby pacifier, his mom started nagging ""why give pacifier, now baby so hard to take care. Last time i could just hug her and she'll sleep."" Cmon, your THIS SON DIDN'T YOU FEED HIM PACIFIER TOO? YOU'RE THE ONE TAKING CARE OR ME. Also she say don't speak things about baby infront of baby. Like for example ""baby very cute, she very guai, her hand very small."" HIS MOM ownself say those infront of my BABY. I mean this is my baby, i know my baby best and his mom would wants baby to sleep with her sometimes, then when baby gets fussy, she'll starts to indirectly says me. ""Why give pacifier, see drop cry drop cry. This baby very hard to take care, keep crying. Baby dw sleep i wan to sleep.""All nvm, i hand washed my clothes and baby's. Washing machine spoilt. When i see she's not drying any clothes. I went to soak my clothes going wash the next day, but instead. She wash her bedsheet and dry it. Till now my clothes has been soaking there for 4 days. I have been re-wearing my clothes for past 3 days.Thirdly, my bf, me and baby went out on xmas day to buy all of ours cny clothes, cause he going ns right. Guess what, he got me a shirt, i just take one from the shelves cause he were bout to pay for the clothes. If i didn't take any, he wouldn't probably rmb getting for me. He spents HOURS LOOKING at his clothes and baby's but mine? P.s. he didn't give me any money, i've talk to him before MANY times.The money that i've earned when i'm preg is all used up. Buying baby's crib all, diaper all. I tried getting from other's but his mom said very 'pangtan' but them taking it from his relative?!?? So? I really don't get it, but i couldn't say anything. At least baby could still have it. I'm slowly getting really exhausted, mentally tired, i really don't know what to do. For your information, i've been disowned by my own mom because of him. He's been sending message to my mom like ""How do you teach your daughter to become a slut.""And messages to me always ""No wonder your father deserve to die because of you."" My father passed way before i met him. I couldn't complete my studies and my dreams, i've got no one left. Friends all drifted because of him ya.For my baby, i really need some help i guess?

I used to save up my pocket money so we could have nicer dates even though he would tell me to save it up instead. I am in a very happy relationship now and we’re even talking about getting married and having kids. I am very happy where I am now. But sometimes I can’t help but wonder how is my ex doing. I feel like it’s wrong for me to wonder. So I would like to ask everyone. Am I wrong to wonder and does this mean I’m not over my ex yet?

100975,"Will you sleep with your manager? Nope, it is not what you think. I just started work at a new company for about 6 months. My manager is an attractive lady who is 6 years older than me. She is very assertive at work and really demands for us to commit time and effort to our task. However, after work she can be very pleasant to be with. A few of us had to work OT on Christmas to rush a report. After that, to reward us, she had suggested dinner and drinks. We had some alcohol and when it was time to leave, she suggested that I get a grab ride with her since it’s on the way. While in the car, she suggested that I could go up to her apartment for a second round, which I obliged, since it was still early.After a few cans of beer, she said I could sleep over if I wanted to. We ended up being intimate. Is this considered a relationship? If not, what does it mean? It seems so wrong to date your manager who is 6 years older, but I feel so attracted to her. Any advice?-#100975: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100975","['Like: 136 people', 'Haha: 95 people', 'Wow: 24 people']",162 comments,49 shares

100969,"Here I want to tell you one thing, that is, girls should not study science and engineering unless you are a strong woman. I will give an example of why girls shouldn't study science and engineering, for reference only!1. The learning process of science and engineering is very unfriendly to girls. First of all, we must all admit that science and engineering are filled with a lot of strong mathematics, strong physics, and strong science knowledge, and the learning intensity is high. Of course, high learning intensity does not completely affect girls, but strong logical thinking skills will defeat many girls! why? As we all know, men are far superior to women in logical thinking ability. This is an indisputable fact. Therefore, we rarely find well-known mathematician and physicists are men. There are very seldom women among mathematicians and physicist. At most, women are found among chemists and biologists who are weak in logical thinking.2.The future job prospects of science and engineering are not friendly to girls. Except for science teachers, most of the employment prospects of science and engineering are given priority to boys, such as mechanics, electronics, civil engineering, and other majors are given priority to most men. They all refuse to recruit girls! At this time, you may ask that girls who are physically strong are not dominant, but majors such as IT, telecommunications and other majors who are mentally based are not always patriarchal! The answer is that it may disappoint you. Girls are equally discriminated against in these majors. Take the IT major as an example. The golden working age of a code farmer is probably between 25-35 years old. Why? One word ""tired"". Because I have to ""996"" and ""007"" at every turn, it's really tiring. Even if a person can last to 35 years old, the hair of a programmer generally does not last until 35 years old. And the golden age of this decade happens to be the golden decade for girls to give birth. Just imagine that you, 24 years old, graduated with a master's degree and entered a major IT company. It takes at least two years to become an apprentice, and there are nine years left. And if a girl gets married at this golden age, she still has to help boys raise children with housework. How unfriendly to girls, how much energy and brain power do you have to focus on work! Imagine if you are an HR in a company and you see so many bad external factors, would you still consider recruiting girls? The answer is no!Summary: Girls really shouldn't study science and engineering, they are really not friendly to you, unless you are a strong woman!-#100969: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100969","['Haha: 25 people', 'Angry: 21 people', 'Like: 14 people']",84 comments,18 shares

100958,"TLDR: Should I leave my chronically lazy boyfriendHi admin, really hope you can post this up as I really need help ):I've been together with my boyfriend for about 4 years+ and we just graduated last year. Throughout uni life, my boyfriend has been very lazy but still manages to pass everything somehow, although he studies for it last minute. Many people ""praise"" him as someone who is smart but lazy. He can learn things very quickly and he can take lesser effort than someone but still achieve the same results.So we just graduated and enter the working world we both entered a sales job I can't help but notice how lazy he is. In any job, I believe there is no such thing as ""last-minute"" as we don't have an end goal per se. We kind of have to work for life, there's no final exam.Anyway, for the last 5 months that we started, he is not bringing home much money.  He claims it is because he wants to start fresh in the new year.Some context is he is earning $1k+ unstable and me about $6k monthly when we both started at the same time. I'm not smarter than him but I try my best. When I'm doing work, he is always sleeping. So essentially he doesn't work at all. However that being said, even when he doesn't work he can still make some money as through those small random conversations he has - people do trust him. Has anyone encountered such a partner before? Do they and can they really change? I've talked to him about it before but he always gives me assurance but as of now I do not see action... Is this just a tough period that we have to go through? Is that small charisma he has able to at least support himself in the future?  P/s other than that he is a really good partner.-#100958: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100958",['Like: 35 people'],40 comments,6 shares
100952,"Seeking advice over bf's mum who is too involved in our relationship.I'm have been in a relationship with my 1st bf for about 4 years now. We used to have a lot of arguments and his mum would often be involved in it, to help us resolve issues. Initially I was grateful because someone was there to guide me through the tough times, but I realised after a while that she was way too involved in our relationship, even after it has stabilised. We have both grown out of the rocky phase and are now working hard for our future. For instance:1. When I am talking to him in person, she would come over and ask what we are talking about2. Sometimes when we want to go out on dates, she will get angry (We hardly go out on dates btw, only 1-2 times a month)3. Threatening my bf that she will tell my parents about my secrets4. Getting angry whenever we say no to her5. Tagging along sometimes when we want to go out6. When my bf buys me drinks or gifts, she would want them too, otherwise she might get jealous. I love his mum, she's very nice to me and my family. I appreciate all that she has done. But I just feel like this is a private relationship between my bf and I, and I'm also really scared to tell her how I feel. My bf does not help me speak up to his mum and I wouldn't want it as well as I don't want their relationship to be strained because of me. Very often I would cry over the small things she does because I'm very stressed out about this and there's nothing I can do. She has told me about how her sons will always choose her and that she has the ability to break ""us"" up. (she said that indirectly though).

100936,"Been married for almost 10 years and without kids. We do not have many common interests and are almost opposites.Since marriage, I have been going through multiple operations. The aftermath of nursing my body was the unfortunate weight gain. I've tried many ways but it's so hard to lose weight. Hubby often accuses me of being ""greedy"" and hence the weight gain. He doesn't show much care after my operations, as he feels that I will be fine and it's not the first time.On the outside, my hubby often likes to portray himself as a loving hubby. But whenever it's just the 2 of us, he will not be bothered with me. More often than not, he likes to put me down. I have always been making more than him yet I have tried my best to ensure he doesn't feel bad about that.When we quarrel, he will always storm away and not speak to me for weeks. He will tell me not to mix with my friends, because they are always ""bragging"" about what their husbands or bfs have bought for them. From the day we got married till now, I have never made a ruckus for him to buy me any gift. Instead, I've been the only one buying gifts in our relationship. Recently, we signed up for a workout activity together and I will always be the one asking him if he will be going, so that we can go together. However, if I don't ask, he will not be bothered to ask me, or will retort by saying I should know his schedule. Whenever I bring up the topic of counselling, I will suffer more backlash from him.

Do anyone of you dreamt about yourself stuck in a house of endless rooms before? Like rooms that varies from pretty decorated ones to those that look like in a abandoned hospital kind? Sometimes the rooms contain people/animals that I talk to and sometimes it is just pure setting. I also have dreams of myself stuck in a loop of afterlife setting. Like, I knew I'm dead inside the dream, holding a tiny book where it list out my positive achievements in my life & of course the wrongdoings too. So, I was told to follow the path like everybody else to walk in a single line endlessly. I can't see the faces of those people and all they do is just quietly holding that tiny book along with me. Sometimes, I crosses various huge gates, sand dunes and lakes. Then, sometimes, the background will play out actual scenes of my life that I had went through as I walk along the endless path. Am I the only one having these? Is this some kind of mental illness that I happen to have and I need to visit some professional help?

100950,"2021 Christmas was probably the worst one in my entire life. I would assume people whose birthday is on Christmas Eve would be having the time of their life during the year end season. But unfortunately, not me. I spent quite a lot of my birthdays over the past 30 years only as Christmas celebrations (the other main reason was because I have always been single). But things changed slightly over the past 3 years because of a significant female friend, however this did not last as I single-handedly destroyed it this year. A close female friend took the initiative to celebrate my birthday on Christmas Eve and it meant a lot to me. No one else really gave a damn about my birthday even though I have a few groups of very close friends (it’s common especially for those with friendship for more than 10 years). Everything was good until this close friend, who trusted me a lot, shared that she just got attached. I somehow felt a sense of queasiness but did not share with her. After we parted our ways in the evening, I went home and started drafting a message (eventually it was a long message up to 2k words) with the intention to apologize to her as I was going to cut her off my life. It was extremely painful and I nearly could not contain it as I wanted to send it to her almost immediately. But I kept it in and decided to send after Christmas (wanted to keep the damage at the minimum during this festive season). Eventually I sent the message on Boxing Day and I did not dare to check her replies immediately because I told myself I would never hurt her. Our relationship started out as friends and it had since been one-sided (never got together). Even after she rejected me and I moved on, we became close friend again after we started to chat half a year later. In summary, I walked her through dark moments of her past romance and eventually into a new one recently. I was certain I moved on but perhaps subconsciously I did not. I hate myself for hurting her because everything for her just started to turn out for the better but I just had to cause hurt at this moment. I did not know what else I could do other than apologizing. I knew it would be painful for both of us as I lost someone who meant the world to me and she lost someone who she can trust. I hope she can be blissfully moving forward and for the last time, let me bite the bullet and take all of these up.-#100950: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100950","['Like: 17 people', 'Care: 15 people', 'Sad: 9 people']",26 comments,4 shares

100948,"Is my sisters boyfriend a gold digger?Just for context I come from quite a wealthy family meanwhile my sisters boyfriend does not but they are definitely not poor.My reasons for thinking he is a gold digger or the male equivalent:When he comes over and they order food my sister is the one who pays I know this because they usually order through my account as I use my points to offset some of the balance, and still after the countless times of ordering for them I have never been paid back.When we go out as a family and she brings him along he doesn't bring anything and he doesn't bother to try to pick the cheaper things in the menu, and its not like the restaurants we go to are exactly cheap.When he comes over he is overly clingy and is quite distant from my parents, doesn't bother to make conversation, just eats, responds to our questions and leaves. However, around my sisters friends he becomes super active offers to buy them drinks and whatnot, and its not like he is unfamiliar with my parents as he comes over very often(3 times a week on average).And my family usually calls my eldest sister (I have two sisters) every Saturday as she is currently studying overseas and while we were calling her my sis and her bf were busy showing each other tiktoks and laughing away.My sister is a shopaholic so she goes to Mbs quite often and when she comes home I usually ask what she bought, and there will always be some branded item she bought for him. I had previously attributed that to my sister being a spendthrift and while there was that I felt he was also manipulating her in a way. For example, I tagged along on one of her shopping trips and he commented ""What a nice wallet, its a shame I don't have the money."" Followed by a deep sigh. My sister looked at the wallet, told us to wait there, walked around some other nearby shops, then bought the wallet for him and the wallet was not cheap at all. Usually that would be a normal comment to make, but she and him have been together for quite a while so he definitely knows her habits.Lastly, we have a personal driver, but lately it has become my sisters bfs driver many times I have wanted to go somewhere but my driver is out driver him around or helping him buy something. Like hello? I really want to tell my sister to break up with him but at the same time she is a very good sister and I don't want to hurt her feelings since I am younger than her I also feel as though I do not have adequate experience to tell her but at this point I am honestly at my wits end on what to do about this whole situation. My parents and grandparents dont like him but stay quiet as they are all generally quite softspoken.Note: My sister and her bf are both currently university students so none of the money they are spending is their own, which makes his behaviour even more frightening-#100948: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100948","['Like: 95 people', 'Haha: 30 people', 'Wow: 27 people']",107 comments,33 shares

Recently, when I came across his phone (he lets me have access to it as and when I want), I saw that he was still texting his ex girlfriend. Although its not very frequent (like once every 2 weeks), and the text content was general, like asking how are you doing, "" I am fine"", ""I went for a drink"" etc, but I still cannot help but to feel insecure and afraid that something will happen between them?  I also saw in his past messages that he still texted her that he missed their times together just a month before me and my bf got tgt. I cant help but suspecting if I am a rebound, although he told me I am not. I am not sure if I am over-reacting to this, I did not talk to my bf about it because I know I should not be snooping in on his texts. I am also unsure if my bf did tell his ex that he already has a gf now, which is probably why she still texts him?

He really won me over with his immense talent (and his good looks). I find myself becoming increasingly attracted to him. When I try to reach out by initiating topics or posting things he may be interested in, he does respond favourably/cordially but I still find it so hard (& scary too) to downright drop hints because it is really hard to convey certain things just via texting alone.  I am also very hesitant because of the long distance (hate you COVID!) & also the age difference (he’s younger), and because I don’t think he feels the same. I really wish I could get to know him even more as a person... but I find myself facing invisible barriers now and then. I’m trying to work on being a better catch myself in the meantime while awaiting the day we can potentially finally meet. I just don’t know if this is worth it, because sometimes it does make me feel pretty sian & emotional.

At times, I'd spot faeces on the toilet light switches because he would use so little toilet paper to wipe saying it's not environmentally friendly etc. He would just toss the soiled towels right into the washing machine without first washing away the poop and I'd be so tired washing up after him.. As you can tell, he is very stingy and isn't willing to spend on a cleaner to clean up. Similarly, he says I am suffering from OCD when in fact he is the dirty one. When I get so pissed at him for being a useless bum and start scolding him in my exhaustion (I have a full-time job and am tired after having to clean up after him everyday), he will say I have a foul-mouth?So am I supposed to keep encouraging him to help keep the house clean, take out thrash every night etc? We are almost reachingn 40 and I don't understand why he's such a spoilt brat. When his unmarried siblings (mid 30s) and parents come to our place for Christmas or CNY, they'd just sit around, watch tv, use their phone and not help wash up, take out thrash or set the table. They don't even help clean or play with my kids. WTF? Don't chat, don't make conversations, don't help, don't wash.. My advise to you is to leave him cos there will be other guys who value hygiene and your sanity. Find one who shares the same hygiene and priorities as you.-#100920: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100920","['Like: 145 people', 'Sad: 61 people', 'Haha: 33 people']",102 comments,48 shares
100904,"Inner thoughts from a closeted gay: I'm tired of life now. Don't get me wrong. I have a stable job which I just started this year, but I'm adapting well. I have good bosses and colleagues. I have a few groups of friends as pillars of support. I have a complete family. Looking at all these, even though I yearn for a relationship, I would always remind and ask myself: do you even deserve it? What if you find a guy and introduce him to your family? Surely they won't come to terms with their son being gay. I know that, eventually I would need to break out of the closet and tell my parents, but I don't know when is the right time?On one end I'm feeling a bit lonely and want to feel loved, but on the other end, I don't want to be a disappointment to my family. That is why I have grown to be more reclusive and quiet at home. I don't talk much anymore. I don't really eat dinner with my family anymore. Even after a meal with them, I would return to my room and just do my stuff. I try to stay away from them (but, like most Asian families, my room door is always open). So what do I do? Grindr? Dating apps? Gay saunas? I have heard horror stories about these places and platforms, and I am not prepared for them.

What’s your religion, did you convert or inherit from parents? What’s your height (!!!)? And many more.

Honestly I was taken aback as I’ve never been subject to such treatment before by anyone’s parents. It’s a contrast compared to when he met my parents, where the conversations were more casual, like abt how we met, hobbies, Covid situation, travelling etc. instead of solely focusing on his background. Also rather disappointed that my bf didn’t say anything as I was being “interrogated” by his family members.In case you think it is a conglomerate family, no they are not. Neither is my bf young and handsome. He is almost a decade older than me and I would rate his looks 4 out of 10.Guys, any idea how to deal with such judgemental future in laws? Is this a dealbreaker?

During the early years, i confessed and got rejected but i didnt ask why that time. After that i distanced myself from him although we are part of the same group or clique. After a few months or a year, we got closer again. Although i tried moving on after the rejection, when we got closer it was hard to control my feelings which resurfaced again. We have been going out together for meals or movies and at times he pulls me closer when we are crossing the road or walking on the pavement. He remembers my preferences for my drinks and walks me back sometimes although he lives in the opposite direction. He is quite introverted and private but recently he has been more open about his personal feelings and sensitive side too.  He has been over to my house to watch movies together and i am quite obvious about my feelings. He definitely knows about how i feel towards him as i have shown clear signs. I am not sure if he is pretending that he is unaware although he always goes along with everything or if he just sees me as a friend although he knows i am interested in him.

He is so dirty, like he will not shower at all unless he leaves the house that day. I don't know about you, but given our weather I think it's basic hygiene for people to shower at least once a day, whether you leave the house or not? Plus he sweats a lot, I can even smell his body odour on my sheets, yucks. He leaves his dirty clothes and underwear all over the house, saying they are ""still clean"". He never washes his feet properly and the resulting unpleasant odour often linger around the house. He spills snacks all over the couch and floor.

Whether he was honest or doing it for attention, I sorta think the shitstorm he got was deserved. However there were two double standards that I had noticed while scrolling tiktok which my gf and I talked about.First, I personally feel that no one should tell a woman how to dress and that when girls dress sexy for themselves, it’s an awesome thing. So when I see a tiktok of a girl shaming dudes that wear “lupsup” for their own comfort, I feel disgusted. It feels like a double standard but if anyone can honestly tell me how I might be perceiving it wrongly, please do.Second, I feel that the acts of rating a girl’s looks/sgnasilemak tele group/the whole leaking of n*des and s**tapes are quite repulsive. Even just saying out loud to others that someone is ugly/chio; I find to be sometimes uncomfortable. However, I feel there is a double standard here when I’ve seen a tiktok or hear gossip about how some pretty girls are doing “charity work”. Meaning that the attractive girl is doing the ugly/unattractive guy a favour by dating him. Both of these double standards came to my attention when the same tiktokers that post/comment originally positive views were the same people that shame “lupsup” dressing and “ugly” bfs. Honestly, if there’s some important qualifier that makes these not a double standard please comment it because right now my gf and I can’t seem to find any-#100909: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100909",['Like: 25 people'],5 comments,1 share

I made the initiative to match with him and say hi to him, and we exchanged our contacts on telegram. We have loads of fun chatting with each other and I made the initiative of asking him out to watch a movie and had dinner together, and we met up for the first time yesterday and I could somehow sense that he was disappointed that I wasn't up to his expectations? I have posted unedited photos of myself and didn't lie about my height, and from photos, I think that he should know that I am definitely not someone who is tall, skinny nor looked like an influencer type, so I was disappointed when I happened to peep at his phone during our dinner, and he was texting to his friend that he wanted to leave the dinner with me as he was disappointed at me being short, ugly, fat and disgusting. I pretended that nothing had happened and we chatted like close friends as we got to knew each other more. I told myself that maybe he is just joking only and would delete the message after that.The day after the date, he had blocked me on telegram, and he left me with a message which stated that he had enjoyed the movie and dinner, but he was upset at himself for being so judgmental as he could not stand being with someone who is like a dinobu, and he admitted that he was being polite throughout the dinner and just treated me as a friend, and just leave me hanging like that. I was so angry and shocked at his reaction that I spent the rest of the day in my room, trying not to cry but I just can't believe that a decent man like him could treat woman like trash.I am now having doubts if I could get serious and decent men on dating apps, and looking back, maybe I should called him out directly on the dinner itself if he truly feel that I am short, ugly, fat and disgusting instead of texting to his friend and wanted 'help' to escape from me.-#100908: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100908","['Care: 89 people', 'Like: 79 people', 'Sad: 60 people']",133 comments,23 shares

To my shock, he actually lashed out at me, saying what’s my problem since the ART result is already negative. Then he went on to nag at me about how he and his friends had already planned for this gathering since long time ago and we better go for it.

100901,"Hello. Seeking some genuine advice and guidance, please don't be mean.I'm gay. I came out to friends and family after secondary school because I didn't feel like I wanted to hide it anymore. I'm not one to raise a rainbow flag everywhere I go (as much as I'm proud to be a gay man in Singapore, I don't like rubbing my preferences in others' faces.Recently, I reconnected with my secondary school friends because I drove by them and saw that they were hanging out. They were pretty chill and just came over to say hi (idk if this is a red flag but this group used to be quite mean to me, wouldn't go to the extent of calling it bullying). I've never come out to them though.I said hi and noticed that 'L' was with them in the crowd. L also used to be mean to me back in secondary school. I've had a crush on him back then though. After we graduated we went our separate ways (he went to a international school).So he was shy and all and I didn't get to talk much to him. One of the guys in the group suggested dinner one day, inviting me as well since I can drive. I lowkey agreed just to understand where they were in life (typical kpo session).Fast forward a little, L soon caught my eye after a couple of dinners and suppers with the boys. I begin to feel something and would always look out for him (making sure I switch places with him if he finds the restaurant cold, making sure he doesn't drink ice drinks when it's late as it would make him sick etc.). I even went to pick him up from a party when he found it too awkward and drove him home even though the distance was short and he could obviously have taken the train/bus back. I bought water for him as well and would drop him off right at this doorstep.However, L is straight. He's had a girlfriend once, broke up because of differing values. He's a nice guy. I love it when he smiles and his laughter is just so damn contagious. I prioritized his needs before mine and would check up on him often to see if he's sick. He doesn't have much friends because of his education path and NS, so he talks to older friends (like from sec school) more. So everytime he says he's bored or is hungry, I'll be more than happy to meet him (which writing this now sounds a lil pathetic) but yeah you get what I mean.Spending time with him, driving him back, gives me small butterflies in my stomach and it's beginning to feel more and more like I can't control these feelings slowly building up inside me. I would send him home and after, I would feel this amazing feeling and wish that he had stayed longer, so that I could spend more time with him.The other day while we were standing around talking, he got really close to me to the point where I could feel his stomach on my elbow (which was q surprising because in the past, just a little bit of physical contact would be dealt with a response of ""eh"" and he would slowly move aside and say stuff like ""don't gay leh"".On another day, we were talking about songs and music in my car. He spoke of how he has chest hair now and suddenly pulled up his shirt to show me his chest. Like woah. When he did this, I immediately looked at his fingernail because I felt it would be wrong for me to look at anywhere else since you know, I'm gay and it would be inappropriate to do so??Since then, I’ve been thinking of telling him the truth, because it’s killing me like nvisjnekfk but at the same time, I understand how straight guys view gay guys too. I’m not sure if he would even be open to it?He's shown some form of acceptance towards gay people though. He once showed me male influencers on Instagram when discussing the kinds of tattoos he wants on himself, and he said stuff like “eh but this guy gay sia f***, ya this one his boyfriend. But okay la gay gay lor cannot make fun of people”.Let me know if I'm stupid lol. I'm one of his closest friends at this point (we talk almost everyday). If I'm to stay as his friend, I don't know if I can keep my feelings to myself. It feels very torturous on my end to constantly have to remind myself not to stare at him but steal glances occasionally. If I slowly back off from the friendship, will that be okay for my well-being? But I don't want to hurt him too.-#100901: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100901","['Like: 34 people', 'Haha: 7 people', 'Wow: 5 people']",30 comments,9 shares

Secondly, whenever she's out with her family members, she will not reply me as much as she reply them when she was with me.Thirdly, during festive season like Christmas day, she chose to celebrate with her sisters instead of me.

100887,"#100865 / #100868: As a fellow VJC alum who lives in the US, I think it's a shame that David Rosal focused on superficial things to like about American girls.First, I can confidently say that the median Singaporean girl has better make-up and sartorial sense than the median American girl.The girls you see on social media and in the affluent parts of California aren't a central representation of the population. Even the staple look with Fjallraven backpack, crop top, Lululemon leggings, UGG boots and scrunchy is not what you'll see at a Walmart in suburban Pennsylvania. Furthermore, you have to normalize for climate: it's easier to dress well when the cold allows for layering.Instead, there's distinct personality traits that are steeped in American culture which gives American girls their unique charm.The median American girl is likely more open to conversation. She's also likely to eschew gender roles and ""be the man"" in the relationship. She's also more spontaneous, empathetic, selfless, confident, welcoming, and self-starting. She's also less judgmental and transactional, and values experiences over material needs to a greater extent. She's also more likely to adopt a more heterogenous set of positions and philosophy on life compared to her peers.Of course, these may not be ""your type"", and that's OK. But I feel these are much more significant reasons to prefer dating an American girl.Speaking of fashion authority, it's not like us Singaporean guys have much clout either. I mean, look at the VJC PE outfit.One day, I was a few minutes early for class, and as I was getting seated, the girl next to me slid a bemused glance towards my VJC PE shorts and quipped, ""Why are you always coming to class in boxers? Aren't you cold?"" I was too shy to look her in the eye, scan her and return the fashion critique. But in my peripheral vision, I could barely make out a smile beneath her honey blonde hair.The VJC PE shorts are so ugly, that I've been married to this girl for 6 years.I think it's OK to dress ugly.-#100887: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100887","['Like: 43 people', 'Haha: 14 people']",6 comments,2 shares

I can feel that he is a very different type of guy compared to other guys on tinder or other dating apps just looking for s**. He feels like the one.However, we have yet discuss about our future together, and somehow everytime I try to bring it up, it would not be addressed.

100865,"David Rosal's mistake was in the manner of his delivery, which is a shame because he was making fundamentally sound points. It is true that Singaporean girls rarely wear makeup, be it in school or at work. Tell that to any China/Japanese/Korean girl and she will be horrified; girls in these countries never leave the house without makeup, as they were correctly taught from young that it is an integral part of being feminine.Same goes with body hair. I think all local guys can relate to this PTSD: remember that horrifying moment when your female classmate in sec sch rose her arms to tie her hair and BAM! A blackforest of armpit hair right in your face. I even had a female friend in UNI who had hairy legs. Femininity is sadly a foreign concept in Singapore.This is why we - and David Rosal - should thank local influencers for their tireless efforts to change the social fabric. We laugh at their cringey insta captions and shame them for their sl**ty outfits, but have we ever stopped to think about the underlying message they are trying to promulgate? GIRLS SHOULD BE FEMININE.

When I'm around, he doesn't want me, but when I'm not, he wants me back. Even after so long and despite everything, I still love him... but I'm really so tired, I don't think I can hold out any longer. Deep down I know there's nothing left for me to stay for, that if he truly loved me he wouldn't keep choosing to hurt me over and over, over the same thing; that this hot and cold, back and forth, borders on emotional abuse. But how do I get out for real this time? Ignoring him, blocking him is of no use... he knows where I live and he'll either come wait here or constantly send things over. I don't understand why he comes running right back every time I try to move on, and why I always end up caving just because he's so persistent.

Not only did he not feel any remorse over his action, he pushed the blame on me since I was the one who exposed his affair. He even mentioned that he was going to sue me for snooping through his phone and invading his privacy. Isn’t it ironic that evidence of adultery is needed in court and yet the means to acquire this evidence requires privacy invasion? I can’t believe a father would think about suing his own child over this when he was the one who was in the wrong. I’m honestly so drained from this and am really worried over our financial situation after this divorce. I think I’m panicking on the inside over the fact that my mom and my siblings might be homeless after all this… I’m starting to blame myself for exposing the truth to my mother since it was perhaps better for me to close one eye and live in ignorance.. life could have been simpler and happier that way..

100850,"These days, I feel that people are taking relationships very lightly. Having so many cases of extra-marital affairs surfacing, fwb, cross partner exchanges etc, I cannot comprehend. I have been pretty depressed recently. So I cut contact with a guy, now for 4-5 months already. I had initiated it because I knew that the relationship was toxic right from the beginning. We already knew we were going nowhere, and eventually the day would come when we needed to go our separate ways. Yet each time, he reaches out to me, again and again I will unknowingly fall deeper for him. It came to a point where I knew it wasn't sustainable anymore. So I told him that we needed to stop so I can move on. Knowing that he knows the right words to say to make my heart turn back, I even blocked all channels of communication between us. Eventually, he still managed to reach out to me and drop a last msg, saying he accepts this, but he was still sad.Somewhere within me, I actually still hoped that he would come back and make me feel wanted. I wish he gave me the feeling that I would have some reason to return to him. But no. We ended via message, with me saying ""Let's just end here"". Between months, I still find myself missing him so much. I would uncontrollably contact him. When I messaged him, he seemed quite contented with his life. I realised I had always been the one holding on to things that don't belong to me, thinking that he would miss me as much as I missed him. I know I am silly. I should move on to find someone else I can rely on. But yet when guys approached me, I only wished that I could be back with him. Many times I had told myself to move on, but when I reached the stage of  ""getting to know each other"", I would feel exhausted and the thought that he is no longer with me will bring me sorrow. Why am I so enclosed?I question myself sometimes - perhaps if I don't love anyone, I would not get myself so upset.

In our contract, it was mentioned that I would only consider accepting any client's job offer if C could garner a minimum monthly basic salary of S$XXXX, which C had successfully done so based on my request. C had negotiated with this client without my knowledge or request, saying that there was 1 competing candidate and C had negotiated for the client to accept me.C is threatening legal proceedings against me for breach of contract if I do not pay them a compensation of 1 month in salary as per the contractual obligations, which had also stated that if I reneged an offer after acceptance, they could seek compensation from me.

100836,"[How much monthly allowance do you give your parents?]I give my parents 20% of my salary (>$700) ever since I started working two years ago, and 20% of any bonuses when I get them too. I learnt that I give the highest percentage amongst my friends, but I’m okay with that as I can afford to and somehow this 20% proportion has been ingrained in my mind since young. Recently, my partner and I secured a BTO. Somehow, this got me to start thinking about finances seriously. I feel that I should save more for future uses such as the wedding, honeymoon, house, renovation and any emergency spending. I’m not engaged yet, but just generally thinking about the future and making a mental note that I have to start being more financially savvy now that we have a home (yay!).I innocently shared this with my mum but she got angry instead and started ranting that kids nowadays only care about planning for their own future and kicking their parents aside. I clarified that I have no intention to change or withdraw the 20% of my salary that I have been providing. I only wanted to save a higher proportion of the remaining amount after setting aside the monthly allowance. However, she insisted that I have become stingy ever since getting together with my partner and that I only cared about my own future.Honestly, I feel quite angry at her accusations as I have not once given anything lesser than 20% of whatever I have. She also commented that I could rely on my partner and need not plan to save so much, which I do not agree with. We should aim towards being able to support ourselves regardless of whether we have someone to rely on, isn’t it? I really don’t know what’s wrong with children planning for their future as the point of planning ahead is to avoid having to take parents’ money for our own expenses next time. Furthermore, I am still giving the 20% without any intention to stop, and I don’t know why she’s so defensive every time I talk about my own financial planning.

100833,"How do I open up to my conservative friends and family about our girlfriend in a polyamorous (MFF) relationship?My wife and I have been happily married for 4 years. Six months ago, we both found a girl (I'll refer to her as C) who melted our hearts. We both went on separate dates with C and eventually she moved in with us. My wife isn't mentally prepared to have children yet, but C recently got off contraception after a consensus decision. We never felt a need to talk about our relationship with others, and many of them think we are just close friends, but we realize it has become somewhat pressing that I inform those around me about our relationship.When we first started dating, I was able to open up about all of the ups and downs to my best (male) friend. But one day, his fiancee audited his texts and told her that she didn't approve of him talking to me about polyamory - which I thought was quite petty and insecure - and so I lost that pillar of support.Many of my close friends are in very committed marriages that motivate their normative views of what makes an acceptable family unit. I tried to steer conversations towards this topic a few times, but no one seems to take it seriously. The most frustrating response is when you can tell that they think it's some form of infidelity or sexual fetish.I also tried to gauge my parents' opinion on this and asked casually if they were OK if I sought a second wife. But my mother was vehemently against it with all kinds of non sequitur reasoning, such as ""You don't have enough time to take care of both wives."" (I'm usually the one being taken care of!) This ended in an argument when I pointed out that it was unfair that they didn't oppose of our Muslim family friends for having second wives. I already had a hard time years ago when I first introduced my wife as they weren't expecting her to be Caucasian. And now that my parents have warmed up to my wife and really dote on her, I feel they'll be even more outraged if they knew I was about to start a family with C.My wife and I want C to feel co-equal in our relationship and don't want her to have an awkward introduction to my friends or family. It's quite frustrating that everyone is accepting of the relationship in my wife's and C's social circles (my wife is American and C is Dutch), but it is only my Singaporean side that comes across as dogmatic and intolerant.-#100833: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100833","['Like: 54 people', 'Haha: 39 people', 'Wow: 26 people']",89 comments,28 shares

100825,"To #100817, I also faced a similar issue and would like to share my story to warn others.I just got married earlier this year, and decided to move in with my mother in law (her husband is not in the picture). She has retired and owns a 5 room flat. She lives there with my husband(the only son in contact with her). She has 3 other children and all do not keep in contact with her. 5 room flat - more than enough space for all of us. But many things happened that caused us to eventually move out.1) The master bedroom is empty and is used as a storage room (she has many items that she refused to throw). Before we move in, we asked her if we can use the room and she agreed. However, weeks before our wedding when we were preparing to move in, she refused to move the items in the store room. So, she actually expected us to stay in there with all the items she does not use but refuse to throw. I was upset but I have no choice, it’s her home. 2) Her home also does not have an electric kettle. When i bought one, she did not allow me to use it in the kitchen (although it is huge and the countertop has a lot of space). I ended up using in my already cramped room with her things everywhere. 3) When I brought some of my clothes with me to move in, she kept saying I am bringing too many things into her home. Mind you, I didn’t bring too many things since I did not even have a wardrobe (it’s full of her clothes and items that she refuse to move). I only brought 2 duffel bags.4) She also woke us up daily at 5am asking us to help her with house chores before we go out for work. My husband said she has never done that before before we got married. There are many other things but these are the ones that I can remember clearly. Throughout this ordeal (lasted only a few weeks), i did not say anything mean to her or talk back to her at all. In fact, i tried to talk to her nicely and asked her how her day was, prepared food for her. She completely ignored me everytime or just glared at me. I just remember crying a lot. She did not even talk to me, she only spoke to my husband. She did glare at him and all, but at least she talked to him.It has been a few months but it really hurt me. It also affected my marriage negatively. It made me feel like I was better off not being married since I felt very unwelcomed. I felt like nothing when I was living there. I cannot lie but at that point of time, i even felt regret marrying my husband. She was totally normal before we got married FYI. Now we have moved out into our own resale home. Whenever I visit (just out of obligation), she is mostly normal and acts as if all of that did not happen. However, I don’t think I can ever forgive her for treating me that way. I am still extremely hurt today. I even have nightmares about it.I have made it clear to my husband that she is not welcomed to stay with us in our home, even if she gets sick and needs extra care.

100822,"Are there any young adults out there who are still being controlled by their parents?I am a 28 male, already working, waiting to get married and have been allocated a flat. My parents however are still demanding me to go home by a certain time, claiming that I will be assaulted / bad things will befall me because I am out late. They also insist to install a tracker on my phone.I’ve tried speaking to them but it all fell on deaf ears, unsurprisingly. The worst part is that my parents often tell my relatives that I am a disgrace which then results in them coming to speak to me to be better (the usual relative talk over family gatherings). This is really becoming extremely exhausting and short of just packing up my things, I really don’t know what I can do.

100817,"Writing a reflective post & perhaps this reflection may help other couples in future. Long post ahead!With the current COVID-19 situation, many couples are facing delays in collecting their keys for their BTOs. Some of my friends have also applied for the new BTO flats which will take around 5-7 years to complete. My husband and I applied for our BTO before COVID hit. When COVID came, our BTO project also got delayed for almost a year. We were lucky enough to give up our BTO with majority of the forfeitures waived off by HDB. We soon bought a resale & will be collecting our keys within the next few weeks. For the past 1 year plus, I have been living with my in-laws. For all the couples out there who have plans on crashing with their in-laws for an extended period of time, I strongly urge you to think twice. Unless, you're extremely extremely understanding, tolerant, & easy-going.  Lifestyle, upbringing, & personality differences will cause a fair bit of tension & unhappiness within the household. My in-laws place is a 3-gen household all cramped into a 4 room HDB flat. They are a very traditional family & have issues maintaining tidiness/cleanliness in the house. It's a real squeeze in the house (together with all their clutter, which they refuse to throw, from over the years). As the daughter in-law here, I am expected to contribute to the household chores. Over the past 1 year plus, they started pushing more and more household chores to me. It's quite a nasty feeling when I clean up the house, just for it to be messy again the following day. I literally pick up after the whole family on a daily basis. My husband and I both work full time (our job doesn't allow us to WFH). My husband works longer hours hence, he cannot really help out with the daily cleaning. However, he has been a great help with our dogs e.g. walking the dogs & showering them.Living like this for over a year has taken a great toll on both my physical health and mental health. It also affected my relationship with my husband. My nightmare becomes his nightmare.You may be wondering why my husband and I never went out to rent a place for ourselves. I did consider it (after we moved in with them) and when my husband tried to tell my in-laws, they got really unhappy. They asked questions like ""why do you want to waste money"", ""what's wrong with my house here"", ""why you cannot appreciate that we are helping you to save money"" etc. The decision ended with a lot of unhappiness & my husband being stuck in the middle.Whenever we try to suggest something or ask for their understanding regarding a matter, we are mostly met with their unhappiness. Hence, my husband and I just choose to keep quiet about everything now. That's not all. Remember how this is a 3-gen household? Well, the grandparent in-law loves to carry tales behind our backs & complain to my in-laws about it. The list of problems goes on and on. This post is just a small part of my current living situation. My relationship with the people in this household (except my husband) is cordial with a lot of tension.  My advice to all the other couples out there who may have intentions to live with your in-laws, I strongly urge you to rethink your choice. It's not worth it to put your health, marriage, & relationship with your in-laws on the line.  Tbh, I had a fairly good relationship with my in-laws before we started living together. I really wish that I had someone to give me this sort of advice before I agreed to move in with my in-laws back then.  Now, my husband and I are really looking forward to moving out as soon as possible.-#100817: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100817","['Like: 30 people', 'Care: 13 people', 'Haha: 4 people']",35 comments,9 shares
100816,"Hi guys, long time lurker but would appreciate some advice. I'm thinking of breaking up with my fiance (dating nearly 10 years, engaged for 3) because his whole ""vaccine-hesitance"" stance has gotten ridiculous. I've gotten vaxxed a while back.Its difficult to be with him as there's a limited number of places we can go, and we can't even dine together outside.I recently got a new job where I have to be on-site and interact with many people (including unvaccinated and possibly C+ people), and for ease of mind, I've asked him to get vaccinated as I don't want to accidentally bring the virus to him through my belongings etc. He's currently staying home cause he doesn't have a job, he tells me he quit because they wanted him to get vaxxed.Anyway, we had an argument about it. He says he's fine if he gets COVID, and wouldn't blame me if he catches it, or dies from it. Because I am not fine with the guilt that would come. He's also okay with the long term side effects of COVID but fears the possible side effects of the vaccine. He also gives stupid reasons like how the vaccine was developed quickly and refuses to listen to any information that actually shows the vaccine development has taken decades and is in all the ""vaccine-hesitant"" telegram groups. He's also telling me we should consider moving out of Singapore by next year (he's looking at Nicaragua), and leave all our families and friends behind.My friends told me I should just break up with him given that he's starting to sound like a mad man and being illogical on the whole issue, and honestly, when I examine his arguments, he's totally being unreasonable given our pandemic situation. He only changed after he joined that ""Healing the Divide"" group.He's not being realistic about the whole situation and nothing I say gets through to him. When I told him that he's actually creating a divide between us rather than healing it, he got upset and blamed me completely for it. Should I break up with him or try to work on the relationship? It's a huge change if I break up because I've dated only him and its a decade of my life down the drain but I don't think I can live with his level of logic and attitude. If there are others who are in this situation, I'd appreciate some guidance.Whatever it is, I'm really not comfortable if he caught COVID because of me.-#100816: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100816","['Like: 19 people', 'Haha: 19 people', 'Sad: 10 people']",56 comments,5 shares
100814,"Do you ever think about your ex partner and wonder how they're doing?For the record, I'm happily married, with a beautiful baby girl. My husband is loving, everything I could have ever wished for. My life is complete, beyond my dreams and I'm really grateful.. But today, while putting my baby girl to sleep, I suddenly realized that it must have been roughly 10 years since my first boyfriend had broken up with me. (My husband is my second)I started to wonder how this first guy is. Not in a romantic kind of way but genuine concern as someone who had known him very well in the past.You see, he's not a bad guy. At all. He just has all the bad luck. And I do wonder how he is from time to time, though I've no desire to get in contact. I genuinely hope things have looked up for him since. The circumstances of our breakup was dramatic, though it was none of our fault. He's just plain unlucky.We had been together about 5 years, throughout university, but he broke up with me the first year after we graduated and started working.The following can probably be written into a mediacorp drama:His family had always been fraught with problems. They're a working class family, with total of 4 brothers. He is no. 2. They could have had a good, middle class life but his father gambled to the point of having loanshark come to the house and to the office, causing him to lose his job.Then his parents divorced, selling the flat to split assets. His father then became homeless, and my then boyfriend who was still in uni, had to fork out few hundreds a month from his part time tuition income to rent a bed for his dad.I pitied him having to support his dad while the rest of his family moved to a HDB rental flat. By this time the other brothers had stopped contact with his dad, only my ex boyfriend was supporting him. Wanting to save on university fees, he deliberately loaded on more modules so he could graduate a semester earlier and go to work to earn money to support his dad and family, with 2 younger brothers who were still schooling. The last straw came one day when I was at work. By that time I had just started working a few months, so he could have been working for a year already. I still remember I received a text from him, asking to meet me that night after work. I had period cramps and really wanted to go home to rest so I asked if we could meet another night. But no, he had something urgent to tell me. So we met at my void deck.I still remember that night. He sat me down and told me everything... He wanted to break up with me. Because his youngest brother, then in sec 3, had been kicked out of school for failing to turn up for the retake of his end of year exam. Yes, so he had failed once and had been retained. The school gave him another chance to come back for re-exam but in between, he had gone to lion dance, fallen and broken his collar bone, meaning he couldn't take the re exam since he couldn't write. So the school had called to kick him out. That was the last straw for my ex bf as his problems seemed unending and which led to his decision to break up with me. Incredulous? The whole situation was incredulous to me. I cried and cried and cried. I didn't understand why it was me who had to suffer a break up when we both agreed I wasn't a problem to him. He then told me everything else. He said he didn't want to burden me with all his family's problems so he had kept alot of the severity of the problems to himself. But during the break up, he came clean and told me everything that had been plaguing him. By that time, I hadn't seen his eldest brother for months. I did ask, but my then bf just made excuses. Only during the break up did he tell me that his elder brother had been caught taking drugs and had been either in jail or rehab (I can't rmb). I was shocked and so pained for him. This meant that he could no longer continue to work in insurance after his release, and the burden on my ex bf to support the family became even heavier. He also told me, when his parents divorced and sold the flat, they split proceeds, and his dad went uncontactable for a week, apparently he had gone to Batam to gamble and came back after he lost heavily or most of it. So yeap up until that point, I had been blissfully unaware of the severity of his family's problems and only knew that they divorced due to his gambling problem and that only my ex bf was supporting his dad by renting a bed space for him to stay. I was stunned. And sad. We had talked about BTO, visited the show flat, discussed applying for the one at AMK etc. Everybody including me, thought we would end up together because that's just how we were. And then as I sat crying and wailing, he told me he decided to break up with me because I was always a happy girl and he didn't want to burden me with his problems. So he didn't tell me alot of these things that plagued him. But when he had to meet me, he had to put up a happy front and he didn't want to anymore. I was bewildered because yes im sheltered, but I'm not unhelpful or uncaring. I didn't understand why he had to hide his problems from me.When his dad was homeless, I even suggested he move in with my own dad so as to save on rent. My parents were and are separated, my dad stays alone in a house. So there was room for his dad. He did move in, but my dad is not easy-going. He has OCD and is very x100 naggy. So anyway, things didn't work out between the dads and his dad had a fall in the house and was warded and later diagnosed with kidney failure and needed dialysis. Anyway so we broke up that night but I was distraught and kept pestering him, stalking him at his house and workplace to force him to speak to me. I even contemplated jumping off his block, while sitting on the stairs in between knocking on his door for him to speak to me. Eventually he told me, please stop knocking on my door. I feel very stressed, it reminds me of times when the loanshark came to our house. It took me more than a year, and a few months of severe pimple outbreak before I got over the heartbreak. I had pimple outbreak from excessively crying, it dried out my face or caused some hormonal changes and at age 25, I had my first outbreak. My turning point came when I was overseas with a group of girl friends doing community work. After activities one day, they took us out fishing for lala in the river. It was evening time. As I floated lazily down the river, I looked up and suddenly saw that the sky was round. I can't put it in words, but the sky was so vast and clear.. clouds dotted the sky. I could see it was indeed round. And I thought to myself: The world is so big, there's still so many things I haven't seen and done, so many things waiting for me.. In that moment, I was filled with hope and excitement for the future and stopped looking back on my past. It took another few months for my pimples to die down.. I discovered the vegetarian diet helped calm my hormones and pimples down. My healing really came after this river trip. I started doing alot of things on my own, like cycling from ECP to Changi Point or Barrage every weekend. Going to swim 20 laps. All on my own. It was very empowering because I had never been a very independent person. And then about a year after the break up, my colleagues encouraged me to start dating again. They told me about online dating. Actually my director was the one who told me about it. That's where he met his wife. So I did, and then I met my future husband. We dated for 2 years and have been married for 5 years now. Anyway, I am just writing to put this on the internet, and putting it out there that I hope this first guy is well and found someone he deserves. I hope things have gone better for him and his family and I sincerely wish them the very best. I keep him in my thoughts quite frequently, like once every few months I would wonder if he's ok. I mean, after all he has been through, I hope god is treating him better now. Oh, actually we did meet about 2 years after the breakup. Purely by coincidence. My grandma had been warded in hospital and so was his dad. My cousins bumped into him and told him about grandma, who he also knew. So he messaged me after that to ask her condition. That's the first time we spoke after so long, I was already dating my husband. Anyway long story short, his dad passed away from kidney failure shortly after and I also visited his funeral. I felt really guilty at that time because I had blamed our breakup on his dad too. Anyway that was the last time we spoke.End of story, it was long.-#100814: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100814","['Like: 324 people', 'Care: 209 people', 'Sad: 80 people']",55 comments,155 shares
100810,"Recently, my department welcomed a fresh grad. When asked if this is his first job, he said no. He was actually from an e-commerce company but left the organisation. I didn't probe too much into the details of his leaving. But I would just like to say that it's ok for fresh grads to feel pressured and stressed when they first start to work. It's also ok to see them leave their first job within a matter of months. In fact, it's normal. I too, was a classic case of leaving my first job after several months due to some matters.Why is it ok? Fresh grads tend to have this mindset of what their ideal job should be. They aim and strive to create that perfect picture in their first job. But reality isn't always the case and setbacks and disappointments ensue, which cause them to leave the work. It's actually good, because now they know that the line of work doesn't really suit them, be it people, responsibilities or company vision, mission. Since they are young, they are able to bear a bit of the loss and search for another job.If they get another offer, good for them. If they don't, then it's time to search hard. And this is also a lesson for them. To cherish and realise that their ideal job is not as realistic as they thought it to be. Then in their next line of work, they would be able to put aside such thoughts and focus. People who think that these fresh grads are strawberry or durian generation. No they are not. They are just normal human beings that are still trying their best to navigate the working world, one that is already being ruled by laojiaos who set the rules as and how they want them to be, and these young people have no choice but to get used to it. So let's not judge them and instead, support them. Teach them the things they need to do their work. Don't know much excel skills (most grads I know really know a few basics only because in uni, who uses excel often? It's all R, Python, Solidworks, Matlab, Arduino), teach them what you use. They don't talk during department lunches. That's fine. It's their way to assimilate and trying to be a part of the group. Initiate conversations with them, get them to talk about themselves. And please, after a few months, there's really no need for department lunches. Sometimes, even I want my own time to just rest my head on the table in silence instead of faking smiles at the kopitiam table. Let them do their own things during lunch. You never know, they might be watching a drama that you are watching too. More things to talk about. To all young and fresh grads, know that you are not alone, this guy here typing, and many others out there were just like y'all. Learn and absorb. Blend in well without losing yourselves. And always be courteous and reasonable, and pass down this attitude to the next generation of new people. Because like you, they will need your support.-#100810: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100810","['Like: 395 people', 'Love: 52 people']",12 comments,93 shares

100803,"To 100783:I do agree somehow but there's a bit more factors to go into the mix for a better comparison. Also I can't reply back on the thread itself due to the fact that my family can see the comments made by me. That's the worst kind of fear a child can get even when I am 30 years old millienial. I will get to that on the scenarios I am in. Some common factorsThe princess syndrome or mummy's boy comes from the child that receives the most love or sometimes the least prejudices held against. And I do agree somehow with the order from which child are borned. Also the power struggle between the parents, who is the actual Alpha in the group will depend on the amount of prejudices slapped on the kid. By the way, my definition of prejudice is the one that goes by Law where harm is given based on judgement or action. Also a fact. Fathers naturally loves daughters because can see how cute their wife were when she was a kid & mothers naturally loves to doll up daughters but hate their bitchy self because now the mums realise how much of a bitch she was. So 3 points to compare per scenario. Most love, order, alpha powerzxc. Let's put it on a few scenarios where there are 3 kids is used. Irregardless on the age gap differences. It can be 2 years apart or 3+ years apart. Scenario A: BBG. Or boy boy girl. You may think, this is the far most solid princess syndrome style, but actually it's not, please see the next scenario. It's probably the 2nd worst one only. If you are finding a girlfriend with this type of sibling order. You can offer your soul by going up the lorry because you have to be better or on par with the 2 bigger brothers. The big brothers are going to be the errand boys for sure for their little sister who is going to received the most love by the family. The better combo is when the mom is the Alpha because even though mom would love to doll up her daughter and play more with her. A girl will never stand another girl, thus her prejudice given to her daughter are more than her sons. So, the mom will balance it out by loving the sons a bit more. The worst kind for this scenario is the BBGF, where the father holds the power. The 2 sons will be 2 lackeys who is going to submit their soul for the princess. Oh if there's any sisters marrying into this type of family, you have one hell of a ride because you now also need to take care of your sister in law!! Comment more below if you belong to BBGM or BBGF. Feel free to chip in more into the point of views. BGG. The next scenario is a tougher mix to explain because you are going to have 3 daughters instead. I have seen this setup before because the princess is now the 2nd child. The 3rd kid is needs to beat down the political bitch in order to survive in this family. The 1st kid need to survive on his male friends or else he will get swirl into the princess mix and become a GN. Why do I say the 2nd child or the 1st daughter will be the princess? Simply because the parents *thought* they can chillax now the sister is out, no need to run around and chase the brother to play. After suffering from taking care of their son, they can finally drop the son & take care of their daughter, literally all love will be channeled to this daughter. I don't even need to talk about which parent is Alpha or not, because either scenario will still benefit this 2nd child. The big brother here will face reality up fast and find things are super unfair. He probably get depression early on plus he only have himself to play with / take in all the blame / run errands. The princess here will have the best time of her life. She will receive the most love, get to push blame to her big brother when things go wrong and bully her younger sister. Remember the point where I said girls simply cannot stand each other? This applies to the best topnotch political bitch princess in this family setup. Any brothers out there dating this younger daughter will eventually like her elder sister instead because of the games she had during her lifetime of political trainings. Comment below if you belong to this one hell of a monster setup BGGM or BGGF! GGG. Honestly, this scenario is pretty much balanced out with not much prejudice. The love are spread pretty much evenly, ok maybe the 1st kid will recive more than the other 2. It's a setup like Jennie Garth. The 3 girls will become strong women on their own. If the mom is the Alpha, the one kenna bullied will be the father! Worst kind of family setup for the father. Unlike previous scenarios above where there is a son to run errands, this father is going to be doing the job. However, if the father is the Alpha, he get to play out like as a Charlie with his strong angels, he will train all 3 daughters to survive without boys. The 3 daughters will need to learn to be strong because they need to depend on each other instead of putting each other down. I think this family setup is one of the kind that breeds women leaders everywhere. Girl power! Who knows Obama's daughter will be the next president? GGGM and GGGF, won't have time to spend on NUSWhispers so I wont expect you girls to comment here. BBBThis is the setup for physical disaster as fights are way more frequent and violent. This is also that setup that every Father's dream about if he plays bball or soccer. However, boys will be boys, they only fight physically but not mentally. If the mom is the Alpha, these 3 kids is going to turn into Tiktokers pretty boys and BTS kind of handsome men. If the father is the Alpha, the 3 boys will end up doing marathons by now or prepare to be NDU or Commandos. I mean just see Ng chee meng's family. You know what I mean. If you are a sister here marrying into this scenario be sure to have fun since your mahjong, gaming, supper sessions is going to be hella fun! So far I have done BBG, BGG, GGG, BBB, what's left is BGB GBB GBG GGB. BGBRemember BGG? The princess playout is the same. Middle child, (applies to daughter only) receives the best attention. But, this time round the 1st brother wont become a GN, because he now gets his other bro to play with but he needs to learn how to deal with his sister. If the 3rd kid gets buy in by the princess, you are going to get a BGG scenario. Ggwp to the 1st brother. This setup is a training ground for a political party between the 1st and 2nd kid, whoever wins over the 2nd brother, wins the battle be it physically, mentally or emotionally. Why I say so, because the 3rd kid mature slower and have to depend on the 2 elders siblings who are on comparable maturity. Unlike BGG, where the 2nd kid needs to deal with her little sister instead. The political thinking & strategy to destroy each other, get more food, drink more coke, all these requires more planning between the 1st and 2nd kid. They have to pull the game where ""i take care of didi more than you"", in order to win. If the mom happens to be the Alpha, she will balance things out between the first 2 siblings. If the dad happens to be the Alpha, whoever shove the fact that the youngest bro gets taken care of, will get what they want. If you are a sister or brother coming into this family for the 1st or 2nd sibling be sure to help gather bullets for your spouse. GBBThis setup I have seen more often actually. This is where adventurous ah lians usually came out from during my 1990s era, leaving the 2 siblings play on their own. Why I say so, it's because girls tend to mature faster and want to reach adulthood faster. You won't find a princess here because this big sister detaches herself and venture out more. If the mom is the Alpha, you will find this big sister grow up to be a dependable big sister (or become the worst nightmare) for the 2 younger brothers. If the dad happens to be the Alpha, no doubt this big sister will become an absolute monster. Till the point of near disowning her. GGB. This setup is somewhat a combo of BGB & GBB. There will still be a big sister maturing too fast. The 2nd sister will follow her big sister. Just that this time the poor brother gets leave behind. This is the setup for mommy's boy creation. Especially if the dad is the Alpha, he will lower the self esteem for his son. That's how this son grows up to be everything also check with big sister or mom. If the mom is an Alpha, she will balance her spouse out and take her son for a joy ride with the 2 sisters more often. The 2 sisters will still fight with each other but rest assured no princess will be created. GBG. As the previous ones where the first G big sister will mature too fast while the 2nd kid and 3rd will play together. I would say this is not the worst setup as compared to BGG or BGB and depends on whether the 3rd kid would bully her brother instead. There also won't be any princess and mommy's boy being created. There's no love imbalance. For sure. Why do I say so, it is because the big sister will chart out all the worst possibilities for the 2 siblings not to follow and just nice the 2 siblings are of similar maturity to pick things up together. If the mom is the Alpha, the bigger sister will become the big dependable sister or set out to destroy the 2 younger siblings. If the dad is the alpha, the elder sis will become the armageddon.-#100803: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100803","['Haha: 4 people', 'Care: 1 person']",8 comments,1 share
100806,"How do i hint my boyfriend that he is not putting enough effort into planning dates? We usually have our meals at the coffeeshops around our neighborhood. He always says that he has nowhere that he wants to visit and tells me to think of something. Even on my birthday this year, we had fast food near my place because he didn't plan anything. Whenever we have small dates, I'm always the one thinking of where to go and what to eat. I am honestly quite disappointed with him recently because nothing has changed even after i have voiced out several times. I'm not asking him to bring me to fancy restaurants or cafes. I'm happy enough to try out new hawker places with him and fyi, we go dutch. Also most of the time when we meet, he is busy sleeping because he is tired after work (his body clock is super messed up).

100798,"I usually take the late train on friday nights. Just so happened that tonight I caught the last train at Dover MRT. As I walk toward the end of the train I notice this girl enter at the same station as well. Something looked off about her. She seemed like she was in a daze. As she got in, she just stood next to the door and leaned her head against the wall. Something was wrong, this girl was clearly drunk, wasted would probably the correct term. As the train set off I noticed she had a little trouble maintaining her balance but did not sit although most seats around her were unoccupied. As we approach Clementi MRT, her discomfort seemed even more obvious. The doors opened and she seemed to be even more uncomfortable. Suddenly,  she bolts out into the station, leans against the wall and merlion.... As I watched I wondered if I could help her. Should I even help her ? What could I have done? Did she even need any help? She clearly seemed to be having a tough time keeping her wits about herself. Could she even get home in that state? Could I call someone? Was she safe? Could I give her something to help? I did not have any water or tissue on me. Even if I were to ask her if she was ok would she just ask me to mind my own business? What if she puked on me instead? Would she feel threaten and unsafe if a burly guy were to ask she was ok in that state? Not sure what I could do but feeling a need to help to do something, I sat there contemplating and watching the scene unfold. Before I could do anything, my decision was made for me as the train doors closed and the last train for the day left the station.To the girl who got off the last train at Clementi from Dover. I genuinely hope that you are ok and you managed to get home safe and sound. I'm really not sure what I could have done to help even with hindsight, but I genuinely hope you are ok.To the NUSWhispers community, what would you have done? Would you help? How would you help? Is this a legal nightmare waiting to happen? How would you feel in that condition if a burly male stranger approached you to offer help in that state?

For example, when he watches football on the couch and doesn't realize I am doing work on the table behind, he will slide his hand underneath his shorts and scratch his private parts, before bringing said hand up to his nose and taking a deep, invigorating breath, as if one were doing meditation. Other times, the scratching results in some dirt that he rubs between his thumb and forefinger into a little grey ball of death, which he EATS. Lastly, sometimes the scratching dislodges a strand of pubic hair, which he examines with keen interest in the same way David Attenborough looks at insects on plants, before sucking on it.I have gone down on him many times and I can assure yall that it is not Bengawan Solo down there.

Without acknowledging the real problem you can never find solution to it!Marriage counselling, talking to close ones for a mediation, sitting for a chat with your wife all these are only going to work if you know what you exactly want from this relationship.

100788,"Does anyone know the basis of how hostel management choose who to be given the slots? Those who were rejected never got to know the reason why they were rejected and why others got the offer instead of them. There is no clear criteria that were given to the student body as to how they select students to join halls, and it just seems unfair that I don't get to know why I was not offered a place. If they are looking at competency, I have leadership experience under NUSSU, volunteering experience outside of NUS, been an active member of the hall in my previous years (taken part in IHG) but still did not managed to get a place as compared to students who never joined the same hall before. If the school informs us that allocation will be based on FCFS or based on leadership qualities or whatever, it will be easier for students to showcase what they can bring to the table yet the school decides to be anonymous as to how they allocate the slots, we can't know what is there to improve in ourselves to have a better chance in securing on campus accommodation.

However, recently i saw him watching dozens of videos on youtube zooming in and validating the beauty/popularity of his bias. Also saw him liking and saving photos with those captions e.g most beautiful women in the world. When i found his ‘secret stash’ of kpop, he kinda freaked out and tried explaining how those are just likes and doesn’t mean anything.I tried asking why he liked those idols to the point of saving their photos and posts and he mentioned that the main reason is because they are pretty..also realise that they are the visual of the group and aren’t exactly strong in dancing/singing so it just feels very superficial to be so obsessed over idols just for their appearance. The fact that some of them don’t exactly have a good rep for their personality/talent, yet he choose to ignore and defend against those claims blindly.

Nothing to do with how chio the girl is. IE:​​Girls who are 1st child, as the 大姐 big sister of the family tends to be more motherly and no princess syndrome, since from young learn to help parents take care of siblings and if younger siblings do wrong, the big one kana scold. So train to be guai guai and set as siblings good example. - so this group normally no Princess Syndrome.​​Single girl - sometimes will have princess syndrome, since only one ... tia mia mia (dote on her)​​2nd to last child - sometimes will have princess syndrome, since always got people take care of her and if last kid ... every one take care of her.

100782,"After leaving a stable job for 3 years  since 2019 December to make a career switch to a completely new field (technical based), I have not been able to stay in 1 company for long, not beyond 6 months between beginning 2020 till now end of 2021. One of the companies I was employed in dismissed me before 2 months and the other dismissed me shortly after 2 months (I had 3 years of experience in that field).  In between my employments gaps, I have been applying many jobs (at least 30?) both technical and non-technical, but I seldom get any response or interview invitation, even for non-technical roles which I have experience in. I feel so demoralised. I have even resorted to lowering my salary expectations to accept a pay cut from my salary before 2020.Despite the paycuts, I still could not pass probation beyond 2 months. My manager was unsatisfied with my performance even though I felt that they should be more forgiving since I was new and the mistakes I made were not really serious. She even degraded me by saying that I wasn't putting any effort at all when I had worked hard and even overtime. I was dismissed on that day without any notice given.After a few months of continued job searching, I finally got a new job offer which has a blend of both non-technical and technical job scopes, and will be starting my first day of work next week. However, I am full of worry and uncertainty of whether I will manage to pass the probation period successfully as I have already been dismissed twice before. I try to think positively, but my confidence level has dropped so drastically despite my motivation to do well in my next job. As a result, I have been losing sleep over the last couple of weeks. How can I get over this, put the past behind me and put my focus on excelling in my next job?-#100782: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100782","['Like: 22 people', 'Care: 8 people', 'Sad: 6 people']",18 comments,12 shares
100780,"I agree with #100764 that the MMTF is indeed very incompetent in their handling of the pandemic but for reasons entirely different from ours.I believe they are taking way too long to open up. They were doing things right at first during Feb - March 2020  when they told people not to wear mask, the country will not be locking down and people would live life as per normal. This is stark contrast with the rest of world who was needlessly panicking and closing shop. However, eventually the MMTF too fall prey to hysteria and ever since our first lockdown and mask mandate, things never recovered.Now, fast forward 1 year and we are still living in this state of limbo. Our eligible population is already 97% vaccinated and still we refuse to completely open up. Why are we trying to limit the spread of Covid with mask mandates and Trace Together when nearly all of Singapore is vaccinated is beyond me. And if you think about it, what's their plan now? To wait for a omicron vaccine which probably will never happen? Even if we have 100% vaccination rate, we will still be stuck with all these restrictions. They keep saying living with covid and making it endemic but are still trying to limit its spread. Isn't the point of an endemic Covid so that everyone gets Covid anyways like how everyone had influenza at some point of their life? Here is what I think, they probably never intended to let Covid be endemic, but the last surge of infection was way out of their expectations with 5000 cases a day at one point and they are unable to contain it, so they decided to say oh we are living with Covid so that 5000 cases is fine but somewhere inside them, they are still hoping for 0 covid cases. I actually believe that the dropping Covid cases is because more and more people who got positive ART test are not bothering with a PCR test and reporting it to MOH. My dad, along with a few workers in his shop, are a few of those.Also, all these vaccine differentiated measures, why not just outright mandate vaccines for eligible people? With all these measures to ""protect the unvaccinated"", we are essentially having a vaccine mandate in all but name. Also if you think about it, if the goal of these VDS to ""protect the unvaccinated"", by that logic, it should apply to people who are also medically ineligible for the vaccine! Just because you are ineligible for the vaccine doesn't make you less vulnerable to Covid as another unvaccinated by choice person! So then the question is, is the goal really to ""protect the unvaccinated"" or to ""force people to take the vaccine as much as possible""? If it is the latter, then why have we not mandated it? By mandating it, you don't need all these VDS that we, the vaccinated have to put up with as well, e.g. having to queue to show your vaccination status etc since everyone eligible would be either vaccinated or in prison! So why have we not done that? Methinks its because of it is because the MMTF don't want to take responsibility of the consequences of mandating a vaccine! If someone gets an adverse reaction due to the vaccine now, they can just say oh, it is voluntary, you chose to get vaccinated and we are not liable. I believe it is just a way to protect themselves and waive themselves of all liability if something goes wrong and pushing it onto us!If I was the government, here's what I will do, my comrades. Outright mandate vaccination and remove the VDS. Remove Trace Together and that stupid mask mandate! Open the workplaces completely together with and our dying nightlife industry. I will completely open Singapore up and let the life we have paused for nearly 2 years finally resume. I will Make Singapore Free Again.

Men has very few materialistic things to mark our achievements.

100759,"Stressed Healthcare WorkerFinally, I have decided to throw in the towel and call in a day after working for nearly a decade as an allied healthcare worker in a public hospital. It’s probably late but I think it’s never too late to change direction.Had I not been exposed to the rotten core of the upper management so early, had I still been sheltered from the fake reality of it all, had I not seen the painted façade of that upper echelons of management, I probably would still carry on in oblivion, believing whatever I sacrifice my life for has a greater meaning underneath. Alas, the hospital management is more interested in generating profits, in optics, in curated public images than in staff welfare. They’d rather prioritise retail space over staff welfare by taking out a pantry when constructing a certain new building.This is the core source of my disillusion. Fighting the fatigue of spending hours dispensing medications and serving patients feel less exhausting than the putting up a fake persona of efficiency and productivity to please the upper management. If I am the HR/ BOSSES in the hospital, I will do the following:(Instead of asking us to call counselling hotline and spamming our emails with brainwashed messages)1) Round up all the patient-fronting staff, ask them what other projects they have on hands and how many of these projects are done after work hours. Strike 95 per cent of those projects off. Allocate time for the remaining 5 percent during work hours. The other 95 percent passes to Operation staff who has no patient facing pressure.2) Employ more locums so full-time staff will have no weekends and PHs. We are bone and flesh humans that need to spend time with family and not machines to be exploited.3) Reduce unnecessary eLearnings, extraneous courses for staff: Data security, customer services etc… especially if those courses are conducted over the weekends. Basically, stop operating like an airline or a hotel business, when you are an essential service. You don’t need to pretend every patient is a high paying customer when 80 percent of them are on MediFund. It adds unnecessary stress to front facing staff. We prefer to be effective, polite and still be able to maintain our dignity as healthcare staff.4) Find out who are the nasty, micromanaging directors, HODs and banish them from their positions. Micromanagers are the worst. They complicate processes, add steps to simple workflows and create stress for everyone by lacking trust at every level.I know deep down, the only people who will read “Stressed Health Care Worker” Post are other stressed-out Healthcare workers. The only people that can understand these frustrating sentiments are other Healthcare workers. But I hope this post offers some solace to those colleagues because your sentiments are not unique. The fact that 1500 people left the first half of the year 2021 is a signal, a sign of an ongoing revolution, an upcoming rebellion. People are quiet, but they are not blind. If the management wants to stifle their voices, they will vote by their feet, by leaving…All the eyes that sit in that Ivory Tower are essentially nothing but eyes without the hands and feet labouring on the front line to sustain the Upper Management’s staggering bonuses. If you are reading this, Hospital Upper Management, can you ask yourself how many more months of bonuses do you reward yourself compared to the job grade lower than yours?#Hospitalstaff #stressed #frontline #Healthcareworker #pharmacy-#100759: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100759","['Like: 185 people', 'Care: 71 people', 'Sad: 32 people']",24 comments,62 shares
100757,"How to best handle an annoying relative? I have this Auntie who started her nonsense when I was still dating. Put in toxic thoughts in me, ie. Asking if my then-bf was cheating when I told her that he's busy. Kept asking me to get married even though my then-bf haven't propose as he was poor & just started working. She knew but obviously don't care. Fast forward I got married, had a child. 6mths after giving birth, at our family dinner gathering in the mall, she touched my mummy tummy (slightly bulging belly) in front of everyone and commented that my tummy is big. 1 year later, she nagged at me every single time she saw me to have a 2nd child. Even when my husband was present, she would say it to me only. We had our plans but couldn't tell her as she doesn't try to listen and understand. So my ears had to suffer for years. And when we finally had our 2nd child (and opposite gender), I thought she will stop. (I am fine with any gender as long as baby is healthy. But knowing her, she would definitely say something like 'Try for a girl...a girl is 'better') And now she starts to nag at me to have a 3rd child every time we meet. Then at a mutual relative's wedding, she touched my mummy tummy again and in front of everyone, laughed at me again. I was pissed, my instant reaction was to touch her tummy back & pointing out that I have 2 children while she had only 1.

100765,"I’m so pissed that my husband bought a luxury car and wiped out his savings in the process, and it’s going to be a lot out of our pocket every month. We still have our joint savings that he didn’t touch, but I just felt like he was too impulsive. I asked him if he ever considered that he wouldn’t be able to pay off the rest, and he asked why I was such a pessimist. He explained that it’s something to reward himself, to push himself to work harder, and it’s probably the one and only chance in a long while before he buys something for himself since we are trying for a baby. To be fair to him, he is always very generous to his family and friends, and has the mindset that money can always be earned back. But I can’t stomach the fact that he willingly made such a huge purchase just like that, and the thing is he only drives probably less than 5 times a month as he doesn’t drive to work. I just feel like the money can be put to much better use like investments and other stuff???-#100765: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100765","['Like: 111 people', 'Haha: 37 people', 'Sad: 13 people']",137 comments,24 shares
100755,"There is a quote saying that in life it is better to be useful than happy.I disagree. What's the point of being useful and unhappy? You would only die unhappy.Usefulness doesn't equate to happiness. Usefulness also doesn't equate to fulfillment. I have a very useful job. I am a teacher but I am not happy. I love and care for those around me. I am useful to them but I am not happy.I think being happy is more important than being useful. There is nothing worse at the end of life than to die unhappy regardless of how useful you were. There is nothing worse in the journey of life than making everyone around you happy while you yourself are unhappy.Whenever I am at my meaningful job teaching children, I think of becoming a pianist. That was my dream but I never perused it bcus it being a pianist is not useful in the eyes of society.I have alawys felt that quote is very poorly thought out.

100752,"In response to the long post on single male dating #100673, I have heard about the statistic although I am not very convinced about the interpretations of the findings. From the studies on tinder and hinge, the bottom 80% of men are competing for the bottom 22% of women and the top 78% of women are competing for the top 20% of men. However, these studies are based on “likes” and “swipes”, showing that it is based on a first impression and this impression may change. Not all romantic feelings are love at first sight, some feelings take time and effort to grow. Also, the demographic of people using dating sites are not representative of the entire population. The gender ratio on dating sites are skewed. In 2015, it was estimated that on okcupid, 68% of their users are male while 32% of the users are female. If we were put it into context with the percentage, assuming a population of 1000 of okcupid users, 680 would be men and 320 would be female. With the top 78% of women going for the top 20% of male, it would be around 250 women going for 136 men, the ratio of women after top 20% males to be 2:1. I think it make sense because remembering what I have learn in LSM1105 – Evolutionary Biology, the ratio of male to female is roughly 50:50 because if there is an advantage in having a specific gender, for example if there are plenty of females, it would be advantageous to have a male offspring. There will be more male offspring and the number of females offspring would decline, and the advantage of having a male disappears. The reverse also the same for females. Hence, if the percentage is truly so skewed against male, the gender ratio would be more heavily skewed. The ratio 2:1, seems likely because the risk of having a male offspring could end with double or no success. Of course, this is just my assumption so my calculations could very well be off.In terms of hypergamy, I agree with the selection pressure on height as majority of the couple have a taller male than female. However, in terms of education hypergamy, there have been studies that show that it has been reduced trend due to women achieving higher education. Studies found that there are fewer single women among women with high academic background. Also, there seem to be an assumption that the 20% top would be the same to everyone. Everyone is unique and have a unique preference when it comes to choosing a mate. Someone who is very attractive to one person may not be as attractive to another. In a sense, the top 20% suggests that these people have the highest trait. What about personal preference and compatibility? These are factors that affect the relationship as well. In fact, there seem to be empirical evidence showing that spouses tend to be similar in characteristics such as age, religion, education, race, physical characteristics, and personality. I am concern here because I am seeing a parallel with flat-earthers and anti-vax. I noticed that most of the comments agreeing to the posts are male which seem to be an echo chamber of sorts. When I search similar topics on forums, people who disagree and voice out alterative opinions are shut off with comments like “simps”. This is like how anti-vax and flat-earthers call other people “sheep” when they try to present scientific evidence. Anyway, I’m curious as to see what Prof Ben’s thoughts on this topic are as well.Link to studies:https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_POPU_1504_0705...https://www.demographic-research.org/.../vol44/7/default.htmhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42001-021-00132-w-#100752: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100752","['Like: 11 people', 'Haha: 1 person']",7 comments,1 share

100744,"Just getting this off my chest. Unsolicited advice welcome of course. I've known her for some years now. It was not an instant attraction but we hit it off in terms of personality and I'm sure she felt it too. Problem was I was attached back then. We got pretty close as colleagues. Then one day it felt like something short-circuited after we spontaneously did something couply together (innocent one k). Still not sure what happened till this day but I think she felt it at that moment too and pulled back from the friendship.Our friendship kind of went dead after that and it seemed like she was intentionally avoiding me for some time with super delayed responses over texts and the jios to go for tea break - which happened quite frequently before the short-circuit - stopped. Over the years, she revealed to me that she avoided guys and being with guys in 1-1 situations outside. Her reasons were understandable, so I pulled back too. My mental state at that point in time wasn't good as well (unrelated to her) so I removed her from my life because I didn't get a proper answer from her on what happened that day we short-circuited as friends but it 100% wasn't something that helped with my mental health. Actually maybe this short-circuit was all in my head. I don't know what really happened with her till this day but if anything, it made me like her even more (I know I know...)Over the past few years, life improved, I managed to get over her, got out of my then relationship for reasons unrelated to her, we attended some courses together as colleagues (I didn't jio, we just ended up taking the same courses), and somehow here we are again. She has also grown of course, and we're now both on a similar growth path unrelated to our main work. So we meet. And every time we meet, I definitely feel the chemistry there especially when I'm being myself around our group of friends. I never expected the feelings to come back, but life has a way of throwing a curve ball because now I'm actually really happy together with someone else and the same thing is happening. I know I won't be doing anything about this but I just can't believe it's happening again.-#100744: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100744","['Like: 26 people', 'Care: 5 people']",29 comments,5 shares
100741,"I recently got a job as an events organizer and the company sent me for a half-day CPR+AED course with 3 other newbies. Near the end, the male instructor wanted to demonstrate how males can perform CPR and AED on females. I was 1 of only 3 girls present out of the 15 people in the class so he selected me. The CPR part was ok, he was v professional in showing how to do it while having minimal contact with my br**sts. But when it came to the AED, he stressed that it was very important to remove all clothing before applying the pads. Then to my horror, he pulled up my shirt and br*, completely revealing my br**sts to the class. I was frozen in shock as he showed them where the pads should be placed and invited them to look closer, which many of the male students did. I glanced at the other 2 girls and they looked equally horrified. He droned on about how ""modesty is worthless if the person is dead"", ""saving her life is the priority"", etc.While I agree with his statements, and concede that he did not touch me inappropriately, I still felt humiliated and wished he hadn't done it. My embarrassment intensified when I overheard my 3 male colleagues discussing me in lewd terms after the class.So my question is, is this worth quitting over?

We have quarreled and argue over many times because of me being clingy. But I just can't change myself... Is there any way to stop being clingy? At times im not sure if i am being insecure or feel unloved thats why i get so clingy because my partner isn't someone who like texting and she stays in her girl friend house. So she rarely texts me and whenever we try to video call to spend time together, her friend would be in her room talking to her and she would just ignore me and only text me when i am getting annoyed and when I tell her that she always treat me like this we will just start quarreling again. Like... the only time we get to spend time together to talk about our day is through text or video call and when we are doing that she just spend her time talking to her friend instead for almost a year. Idk what i should do...We quarreled many times about needing the balance to spend time with one another and friends. After quarreling things will get better for only days before it revert back to norm again and we will just keep quarreling over and over again. She is graduating soon and will be coming back but I can't help but feel too hurt from all this going on but at the same time because of all this  I cant help wanting to cling onto her.

After the job ended, we had a chat over meal at the staff canteen. He seems like a nice, shy guy. I think we had quite a good chat then, atmosphere wasn't awkward and the conversation flows well. During our chat, he asked for my social media account (I think he phrased it across two times) but I did not give him, as then I was thinking since I might not be going there to work again hence probably ""pointless"" to keep in contact as I am kinda tired of those one-off/drifted friendships, and also I am not that active on social media. And we departed from there and walked in different directions. Somehow we managed to end up in the same train cabin (the train was pretty crowded), I noticed him but I think he did not see me. So on my way back home, I suddenly felt bad and regret that I rejected him (in a nice way) for not adding him as friend on my social media.. I mean he at a young age, probably would have mustered all his courage to ask me for it whereas I did not appreciate that. Also after that I think it would be quite interesting to have such young friend (which can be like a younger brother to me if the friendship goes on) to share about perspective in life etc since huge age gap.Somehow this regret feeling of losing a potential friend have been going on in my head. I am not sure whether if still able to meet this guy again or anyone who is that young age with good and mature character (based on first impression of him, he seems to be that way). Maybe if fate allows and we will meet again or the saying - the right people will be in our life? So even if we do not meet again, I shouldn't be as bothered about it as everyone we meet in life is kinda fated? Maybe I am thinking too much and that I should not feel so deeply about this and I should just open up and make more new friends? Probably I am feeling this way as I don't feel the closeness I have with my other friends hence it felt like I have lose a potential new ""long-term"" friend (I don't know).This is just a rant.

Breaking up isn’t an option, because as long as she’s willing to stick with me, I’m willing to do anything, even if it means endure seeing her use dating apps and sugar daddy websites.

100723,"Hi, just wanna ask a few logical and thought provoking questions.How come what the media portrays is the OPPOSITE of what we learn about gender stereotypes? I thought men are genetically wired to be violent, so men are the ones in gang fights and bar fights, and they settle conflict with a bloody punch to the nose and a few broken ribs. If that’s the case, then why is it that it’s women who slap? If men cheat, it’s “acceptable” for women to slap them across the face, but if a man were to slap a woman, we say it’s domestic violence. So slapping, an act of violence, is ladylike and feminine, and thus attractive? If men are generally seen as angry and violent, while women seen as gentle and empathetic, why do we never see men slapping women but always see women slapping men? Does that mean violence is more of a feminine thing than a masculine trait? Also, assuming you support violence and  you believe that slapping men is right, (you might have done it in real life before, I don’t know?) then why don’t you use the same amount of force to punch his stomach or face instead? If you’re upset enough to slap, then wont stomach punching cause far more pain and injury than face slapping? You could dislocate his jaw or cause some serious bloodshed if you condone violence through slapping?

""Shall we get popcorn?"" I said, to which he replied, ""Oh I got it already while waiting for you just now,"" patting his bag, so we just went Dutch on the tickets. When we found our seats, he unzipped his bag and exclaimed ""Tada!"", pulling out a pack of popcorn with NTUC PACKAGING. Oooookay that's new, I thought to myself, while he grinned, ""Smart right? So much cheaper and so much more popcorn. Value for money."" But that was not all. The next horror he pulled out of his bag was a HERBAL DRINK. ""Popcorn very heaty, must drink this,"" he said, not forgetting to add, ""$1.50 only sia, value for money.""At this point I just wanted to watch the movie then go home, but Mr. Value-for-Money had other ideas. About 15 min in, he whispered, ""Er can you eat at the same speed as me? I notice you have eaten much more than me."" I did not take another popcorn after that.After the movie, I faked a reason to skip dinner, but he said, ""How about ice-cream? Then we can chat for a while."" I reluctantly agreed in order to be polite, then fml-i-should-have-seen-this-coming he led me to MCDONALD'S. Forcing myself to say thank you as he happily handed me the ""value-for-money"" 70-cents ice-cream, he said, ""Welcome! You can paylah me later together with the popcorn and drink. I'll calculate and text you the amount.""This date was not value for money.-#100697: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100697","['Haha: 464 people', 'Like: 208 people']",176 comments,136 shares
100700,"My boyfriend doesn't seem keen to meet up with me after I got covid.I caught covid 3 weeks ago and during the 10 days period, I had to be isolated in my room. My boyfriend was rather worried for my health and voice/video calls me 2 times a day and frequently brought food and groceries over to my house to help my family out. He kept saying how much he misses me and cant wait to hold me in his arms again once the isolation order is lifted. But even though the isolation order has been lifted for 5 days now, we have yet to meet up as he started stating that he is very busy with his new work project that just commenced. While I understand that his work can get demanding at times, He seems to return home fairly early without any overtime and manages to gym 4 times this week and still met up with his friends for supper on 2 of the days. I hinted that I would like to see him even for a short while this week but he just brushed it off and even though I mentioned I could make a trip to his house instead to accommodate to his busy schedule, he declined meeting up stating we can meet up the following weekend instead. Still, he kept reemphasising how much he misses me and can't wait to see me again.What does it mean when a guy says he misses you but seems to act otherwise? Was he not keen to meet up with me? Is he afraid that I could pass on the virus to him? I was expecting couples to be running to each other's embrace after being separated for a long time. This was a totally unexpected response from his end.

100699,"Growing up a true blue Singaporean , I’ve always thought all of us Singaporean men have to serve National Service. It’s only a question of whether you get posted to SAF , SPF or SCDF. We have all read & had our own opinions about controversies regarding our top sportsmen having to juggle ns with their sports. Some risking possibly prison sentences to play their sports overseas.A few months ago I suspected that one particular Singaporean male , aged 25 has somehow , I strongly believe , managed to completely escape serving Ns. I thought it was just a typical young guy trying to trash talk but then I realised .. which Singaporean male doesn’t want to admit he  served NS? I wrote to mindef but their response is ;As this will be looked at internally, we would not be able to disclose any information. However, please be assured that the SAF takes a serious view on the matter and would carry out the necessary actions.The fact that this Singaporean is still walking around with no news of him being enlisted, I’m just wandering if there are indeed any medical conditions which would completely exempt any Singaporean male? I sure hope not and if it is the case then he apparently sure looks very much active and healthy and ready to serve the nation. Better late then never..hope Mindef would clear the air for all Singaporeans.

100691,"How do you know a friendship has died? It's been 4 years, so much has changed. Hey youI think everybody deserves a proper ending, although to you it might just feel like any other time. To me, this is how I will end it.Funny how when you're deep in something you never realise the issues, and people around you are always the ones pointing out the red flags.Friends come and go. It's time we go.There are two kinds of friends. The chat-regularly kind, and the meet-twice-a-year-during-birthdays-to-catch-up kind. We used to be the former, but things change, and recently the wool over my eyes have been removed by my friends. It's difficult to play tennis by myself, the ball is always in your court.When I reduce my reply enthusiasm. Or slow down my replies. Or stop being the one jioing you.  Or sending articles of things we should try. Then we wouldn't talk for long periods. You might reply enthusiastically, but once every 2 weeks. Yet when we do meet up to catch up, you're always on your phone when we are walking around. You will reply, just not to me. An observer would have realised I'm being played, but not me when I'm in it. We used to be able to talk about random day to day happenings. Then I filtered what I said, because since you won't reply, time-sensitive comments and jios don't matter. Now, we don't even talk about big life events that happen to us. Simply because if I do tell you, you wouldn't read it anyway. Let's catch up less regularly, on your terms. If you don't initiate, I guess we then both agree that I'm always the one initiating and putting in all the effort in this friendship, and let's call it a day.Thanks J-#100691: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100691","['Like: 51 people', 'Sad: 20 people', 'Care: 15 people']",12 comments,16 shares
100688,"Recently I have a few friends applying to Shopee for full time job, and they have went to the extent of lying about their counter offers from high paying companies (ByteDance, Tiktok, OGP... etc). They got the information and data from a spreadsheet that is shared in the Project Intern telegram group, hence the offers that they claimed to have are compelling enough to fool the Shopee HRs, and the HR themselves does not do any validation on their side. I feel uneased knowing that they have lied their way in achieving higher salary (higher base salary, with stocks - RSUs), yet on the other hand I do feel the urge to try it as well as I am low balled by Shopee. It is obviously wrong and unacceptable to do so, and I shall continue trying my best to get a better competing offer.

100685,"100665 continued. I read the comments and would like to give some backstory. I can feel the lack of communication for the past 1-2 years and things are not sweet or loving as it used to be.  I couldn’t get answer from him and suggested to break up a few times because I feel things are not right. For example we will meet every weekend but we don’t have much things to talk over a meal. I feel that he purposely dont want to communicate. Probably feeling guilty because he cheat? He can talk a lot with other people except me. He also not keen to meet my friends and family. We are of same age so I started working earlier and is more financially stable. I am more matured than him and wanted to settle down. I gave him many chances to walk away but he still holding onto me. Few months before I found out that he cheated. He will often smile while texting. When I checked his phone and saw his sent heart sticker to a female. He explained to me that he sent to everyone and asked for my forgiveness. He is afraid of losing me. For a while before we break up. I feel like I am talking to a wall, getting no response from him whenever we talk. He just kept quiet. It was frustrating because I know he is hiding things from me. I just think guys just don’t want to be the bad guy to initiate breakup even after he cheat or find that we are not suitable. They will just hold onto to the girl and wait till they cannot tahan then ask to break up.-#100685: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100685","['Like: 6 people', 'Wow: 1 person', 'Sad: 1 person']",8 comments,1 share
100690,"TLDR. Need to rant. My friend who used to like me (one-sided) for 5+ years recently asked me out for lunch one on one (again). I ghosted him. We know each other for 13 years since JC and are somewhat close friends. He's currently attached. Before our previous meetings in the past (we only meet once every 1 or 2 years), I suggested that our other friends could join us but he refused. So, we ended up meeting one on one. In our first few meetings, he brought up the times when he used to like me and said things like ""if this/that didn't happen, we could've ended up together"". He also made comments about my body ""you are _ cup right? Your future husband is gonna be so lucky"" or ""you have the nicest body among our friends"". He's already attached at that time. Idk if he said these because we are kinda close but I was freaking uncomfortable with that and told him to stop. What's more, I thought he told his girlfriend that he was meeting me. But it turned out that he didn't. I knew because he suddenly got a call from his girlfriend AND he decided to not pick it up the first time, which I thought was something really weird and inappropriate to do to your partners. After a while, his girlfriend called again. He asked me to keep quiet while he talked to her on the phone?!?! Felt like a freaking third-party. That was when I told myself I shouldn't meet him individually ever again.Another time he asked to meet again (with another friend), I agreed. We had lunch and walked around. The other friend went to the toilet, leaving me and him. And guess what? We saw his girlfriend, who was surprised to see him because he didn't tell her that he went out with us. Honestly I don't even know if the girlfriend knows about me or not. Do guys tell their gfs about their female friends? Honest question because I really don't know anymore. Because of all these actions of his, I can't help but feel like a third party.From then on I kept coming up with excuses to not meet him and kept my distance from him. Also didn't attend his birthday party, didn't wish him (which he told me that he was disappointed LOL). Also, when we were gonna part ways he'd always want a hug. It's not those quick friendship hugs, but hugs that last for like 5 seconds? IMO I don't think this normal, not to mention that he has a girlfriend. Because idw all these to happen between my future bf and the girl he used to like. Frankly speaking I don't feel comfortable meeting him one on one anymore. The fact that our JC friends also said that his girlfriend ""looks like me"" and that ""he's only together with her to replace me"" ain't helping the situation. They even asked how I felt about him having a girlfriend after liking me for so long. I mean, what the heck were they expecting me to say, giving such absurd comments.Recently he asked to meet again and I ignored his messages. Everytime when I'm online on whatsapp I can't help but be worried that he would see me online lol. Should I just tell him that we should maintain a distance and not meet individually because of the above reasons? Or am I just being overly-paranoid? I honestly don't know what guys think but as a girl, or if you were to put yourself in my shoes, when:- a guy friend doesn't tell his gf that he's meeting you- asks you to shut up when he talks to his gf over the phone- makes sexually inappropriate comments about you - mentions the possibility of an rs with you when he himself is attached ...I think it's really inappropriate and disrespectful to his gf and myself???

100673,"Read this if you are a single male who wishes to, but has trouble dating.Men are mostly logical, so here are some statistics that you can easily google. Most of them are approximated/rounded for easier typing, but you can fact-check them.Dating applications like tinder and okcupid have released their data before, and it has been revealed that the top 90% of women go for the top 10% of men, while the bottom 90% of men go for the bottom 10% of women. Men rate women fairly, with approximate equal amounts of women being above and below average, essentially a bell curve. Women, however, rate 80% of men as below average.There is definitely nothing wrong with wanting the best partner for oneself, but when 90% of hunters are going for only the top 10% of catches, this results in super skewed dating experiences. A female will constantly gun for the ultra chad, and wind up feeling like they settled when they do eventually pick one, while a large majority of men are just invisible on the dating market. You will be hard pressed to find a woman who actually believes that her boyfriend is below average. The truth is that men cannot all be above average partners, simply because that is not how statistics work. Statistics aside, the qualifications necessary to even be considered by women for a romantic interest is also skewed against you. Height, looks, dressing, education, job etc. You have to be above or at least equal to her in most aspects. Very few women will date a man less educated than themselves, to the extent that you actually will read about Uni grads dating ITE grads on news sites simply because it is so rare. Same goes for height, where if you are unfortunately below 165cm, you are really playing on hard difficulty. All these can be severely looked over with insane amounts of wealth, to a large extent. But unless you have a Lamborghini to help you with that, you can only work on what you have. Again, I know of some women who can overlook such stuff, but these women are practically unicorn when you compare to the overall population. On a side note, you can beat such expectations with women from developing countries/regions, such as SEA, Russia etc. You will easily beat out the resident male population in such countries, in terms of most of the metrics that I have pointed out. That’s also why you see siambu wives and Vietnam girlfriends. Let’s say you actually get a girlfriend. Congratulations! Just what are you getting into? Here are some perks of the job, and what will be expected from you.You get an aesthetically pleasant partner to hang out with, who can possibly increase your social standing in the eyes of your friends and associates. You have a ‘partner-in-crime’ to do fun things with, unlocking some exclusives such as pottery, art jamming, or bakery lessons etc. You have someone to BTO together with, have children, and potentially look after the house in your stead when you are busy/at work/occupied. You get 24/7(almost) company, and encouragement to strive in your endeavours. Your safe space from the evils of the world is present in said partner. And you get to make love to someone!Or….it can all go the other way, an ugly partner, one who is socially suicidal, does not want to try things with you, expects you to buy the BTO, take care of the children, and virtually not contribute at all. You are robbed of solitude yet afforded no company. Worse still, your child may not be yours, and you are merely a financial support for a woman who sees you as nothing more than a tool to be used.On top of that, you take on the role of guardian, where you are expected to throw yourself into harm’s way, no matter the situation. You increase your mental load with the birthdays, obligations and potential trigger points of their insecurities. You take on a portion/majority of the finances cumulatively spent, risk losing a significant chunk of your belongings in a divorce, and even bastard children that you can never truly guarantee are yours. You put up with unreasonable behaviour and moodiness especially during menses periods, and it is generally expected that your partner will strike you when she is upset, especially since society plays it off as acceptable or even encouraged for ‘shitty‘ husbands/boyfriends. You will lose 2 close friends on average with every relationship, and a part of your identity as you give up whatever hobbies that may not be acceptable to her. You can’t even have female friends or even look at other females, for a majority of girlfriends.Relationship is all about give and take, and the honest result is that there will likely be a disproportionate amount of giving from you, while she takes. The domesticity of a wife is mostly compromised with the modern woman mindset, so you can skip the idea of a clean house and homecooked meals. You can expect to have a greater portion of household chores as well, whilst letting her control your purse strings, football nights, or even outings with friends. Sex is not a guarantee either, if that’s the one thing that is still tying you into this deal.Before I get bashed for saying that a man cannot expect anything from his partner, and that a relationship should not be measured by who gives more, you are right. You have no claim, nor can you demand anything from your partner, a person who is free to decide any and every decision for herself. You can be the best partner in the world, and still receive no reciprocity. Society has mostly programmed the reaction where a wife’s demands not being met is seen as a failing on the husband, while a husband’s ‘needs’ are mostly suggestions for the wife’s consideration. And hypergamy will always be ever-present, for those of you feeling insecure to begin with. Her supportive colleague, best male friend, friendly superior, handsome classmate will always excel in areas you fail at. A man is valued by what he brings to the table, whilst a woman’s value is intrinsic and ever-present simply on her person.On the flip side, you provide to her the same suite of benefits and almost no disadvantages to such a deal, provided you are a normal functioning adult. Perhaps childbearing will be the only thing that you can truly stand to gain, but again, that’s still up to her. Keep in mind that the issues I mentioned will exist in the majority of Singaporean women, not all 100% of it but a supermajority. There will always exist outlier cases of shit boyfriends that have a wonderful girlfriend that gives a lot more into the relationship, but by and large, the majority of giving will be done by you. Don’t forget the copious amounts of giving in too.A funny story: I recently went for a meal with friends, and I made everyone at the table laugh, both male and female, when I mentioned that my girlfriend had to be a reasonable person. Everyone agreed that I was pretty much looking for a yeti.So what does all these spell for the average gennerman?To you, I ask “Why?” If you wanted someone to do things with, you can do it with your friends. Most ‘exclusive’ events are catered to women to begin with, and those that you may actually enjoy/ want to try out, you should have no problems engaging in them with your friends. I have done picnics, archery, fitness classes, cycling, skinny dipping, cookouts, shopping, baking, café hopping etc etc with my platonic friends before, both male and female. Add to that the physical capabilities of the average man and woman, and you will realise that you actually can do more things with the same gender. You can go at a pace that is more to your own, be it climb mount Everest, bike across Singapore, bouldering, or even supper etc. Damn, you can even go clubbing and socialise with others, instead of having to constantly bat off roving hands; you lose a whole range of activities once you become attached as well.On the bright side, you do supposedly get a regular supply of physical pleasures/company etc. But from a logical stand point, a prostitute or even paid dates would cost less, and without all the issues that come with a girlfriend subscription. You can get the best parts from a sugar baby, and none of the other bullshit parts. You literally get all the fun without the extra commitment, and of the exact amount as you deem sufficient. Take it from someone who considers himself a horndog, that you can actually have too much intercourse. Both my JC and Uni partners are testament to that, where we would actually engage in risky behaviour practically everywhere at their behest. There are even moments where I actually wished that I didn’t have so much, especially when my muscles were cramping, kidneys throbbing, appendages sore, and simply sleep deprived. I actually dreaded when my partner would just start feeling me up, because I knew what was to come, and the boyfriend duties that I would have to fulfil. Throw in divorce statistics, where a majority is initiated by the woman, and the fact that 90-95% of alimony is paid out from the man to the woman. The numbers get worse with women of higher education, where a larger proportion of college educated women initiate even more divorces than their less educated peers.You do enjoy some benefits if things go very well, but the realistic chances of that happening is low, and near impossible to keep up with for a lifetime. Don’t just take my word for it. Observe for yourself in your life, how all your fellow male friends are doing, and decide for yourself if the payout is actually worth it.It is worth noting that I’m not pushing for some social agenda or anything by writing this, but more of inspiring contemplation with regards to the valuation ascribed to relationship roles. The average man is likely to value add, but are treated as beggars. An average woman is likely a liability yet thought of as complementary. Most men are guilty of condoning such behaviour with a ‘That’s just how it is mentality’, while women inadvertently develop an entitled attitude towards the privileges they unknowingly enjoy. Happy wife, happy life? Why not happy spouse, happy house?Hopefully, this paints a more realistic picture for singles, and encourages attached persons to be honest with themselves, if the relationship really is what they want. The grass may not always be greener on the other side.Granted, I lean more towards the already happy end of the spectrum with fulfilling friendships and moderate successes in most metrics of my life, but I can tell you that a woman will definitely not make you suddenly complete or happy like so many of you are thinking of. This is not to tell you to give up on yourself or women entirely, but rather, take care of yourself, workout, earn money, build your worth. You can enjoy life alone as a high quality individual a lot better than being in most of the dysfunctional relationships that are normalized at the expense of men. I understand that a relationship is not always logic based, but if you maintain respect and uphold standards for all parties, including yourself, you will have a much more satisfying experience. And if you do eventually end up with a girlfriend, you will also be a more holistic individual who can better appreciate what you have.P.S. I think it’s fair to point out that I’m part of the demographic that actually gets to choose my dating partners. I’m no super chad, but I find it hard to think that most of society appears to be blind to this market inefficiency. Most of my friends ascribe to similar expectations, and their relationships are a lot healthier that way. It’s not about hating on or complaining about the system. We can all grow and be better, whether you choose to date women or not. The goal is you, not women.  Women may come and go, but your gains are yours and yours alone. There is plenty of space on the podium of life, and I wish my fellow wojaks all the best in their pursuit of growth and maturity.-#100673: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100673","['Like: 242 people', 'Care: 19 people']",167 comments,146 shares

100672,"I just really needed to get this off my chest and to make peace with how things are turning out.I first got to know him in June this year. We clicked really well from the start and had a lot in common. We even made the joke that we were the same person, just in a different gender. We were getting along pretty well and it wasn't long before I actually caught feelings.But long story short he didn't feel the same. He didn't out rightly reject me. He didn't push me away immediately but he did say that we shouldn't meet up anymore. On hindsight, this was clearly a rejection, just that he tried in his own ways to cushion the blow. Regardless, stubborn me decided to have faith, that with time, he'll come to realize that I'm worth his time and that I'll still have a chance... As long as I am patient.Now close to 6 months later, I'm still thinking about him. I'm still staring at his photo, I'm still turning my head at every motorbike the crosses my path. I'm still questioning the emotions that I'm feeling. I'm still trying to reason things out. I'm still at odds as to whether I'm being ridiculous, or am I actually making the right choices.But I suppose all this doesn't really matter. There's really nothing much I can do apart from wait. Wait for all these emotions to fade.-#100672: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100672","['Like: 22 people', 'Care: 15 people', 'Sad: 5 people']",21 comments,3 shares
100669,"I posted this somewhere else but I need more serious advice. I mean absolutely no harm, I just want to feel love and happiness. But do you realise so many people take things for granted? I won’t reveal names but these are actual conversations I had with different people.  1) me: how do you go for so many outings and parties all the time? A: I don’t know, people just invite me? 2) me: how does it feel like to stay in a big private property and wake up to a table of branded bags and wallets? B: I just feel normal. Isn’t it normal? 3) me: how do you make your friends remember your birthday and remember to buy you present? C: how can you “make” people remember to buy you present? I don’t! Me: then how come you can get so many? C: because they are my friends? Friends will remember birthday what! 4) me: how do you make your boyfriend remember  to surprise you on your birthday and anniversary? D: I don’t remind him or do anything, is he auto do. 5) me: how do you get so many notes, cards and presents from everyone? Like so much??? E: Is people want to give me then they give lor. Me: I see that so many of the notes are so touching. You cried after reading them. How to feel so touched until you cry? (Pardon the bad phrasing) E: this kind of things cannot teach one. Is feeling. I from young is can one. How to teach you? Me: I also want to feel so touched that u cry but I don’t know how it feels like. E: but I cannot teach you how to have feelings. You cannot then you cannot. Everyone is so innocent. I don’t know. I didn’t do anything. Having good things happens is just natural. I also don’t know why god loves me so much and favours me.

100671,"I am starting to find dating boring, tiring and expensive. I also find that it is unfair that guys have to do almost everything. I will be putting the juicy part about me complaining about girls' lack of efforts in dates in the 3rd last para. Burn me if you want to in the comments section.  If you think girls put in a lot more effort than guys, list the things in the comments as well. Would love to hear about those. Most of the time it goes to 2-3 dates and some don't even go beyond 1. The worst ones are those that you spend weeks or months on the app and never meet in real life. I love it when they find something stupid to stop dating me like my salary or my choice in music (yup that happened) or because I don't drink alcohol or the best one and the most common one, because I want to have sex after marriage. I do ask them why they want to stop and those are the reasons they give. The more polite girls use the ghosting method which makes me feel more respected My salary, though average, is definitely sufficient to run a family. I am just no rich  You do realise that I could get a better job in the future right? I might be the next Elon Musk who speaks singlish. Get ready to eat your words!Oh yes, if I was a girl and I wanted sex after marriage, my wish is to be respected and I am apparently holy. If I have the same request as a guy, I am a loser? Love the double standard!!!I only reject girls who are rude, manipulative or think they are made of gold unlike everyone else The rule is that guy has to pay for the first date so free meal for the lady. If I ask to go dutch, I seem petty. If I pick a simple place, they complain so i have to find something that is at least mid tier. To be honest, I don't mind paying for meals even it means for the rest of our lifes together. The problem is that we stop seeing each other after a few dates and this happens so often. I am losing a lot of money. I also feel that the guy has to put in more effort. Come on, the competition is rough out there. I am not exactly Chris Evans. To make myself stand out, I have to put a lot more effort. Based on the person's profile, I would think of a relevant place or activity for the dates. I would research about the things they mention in their profile like a certain sport or some famous figure. We will have more to talk about and most of the time, it impresses most of them except for the ice queens. They just need to come and enjoy the date, no effort from them at all. They might not even remember my profile  or what was in it. If the date sucks, then it is my fault. Yes, I feel amazing when that happens, especially listening to them complain.I have done this dating thing so many times that I have a routine like those guys performing shows on stages. I have experimented on various jokes or types of humor and found the most optimal ones. The only thing is that since I pay attention to their profile, I might customise it to them. We also talk about the things. Literally the same darn things. Deal breakers, interests, etc. Same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over (approaches infinity).As i mentioned, I am not Chris Evans but I do groom myself as best as I can. Most girls would come to dates in a decent outfit. I love it when girls come as if they just woke up from their bed and show how much they care about the date. I find the lack of effort from girls extremely annoying. Some come to dates not remembering my profile. If the conversation is dry, I have to be the one who has to keep it lively and prevent it from turning awkward. Most girls don't even try anything. They get free meal on the first date. They don't have to plan dates. They can give the uninterested face and it is fine. If I do it, then it is a sin.Out of all the girls I have dated, only 3, that is right, only 3 girls have seemed to put in effort. 2 of them made an effort to keep the conversation fun. The last girl planned the second date voluntarily. I am still friends with all 3 of them till today because they are WORTH IT.Honestly, I don't mind putting the effort. It is fun to do some of the things. If nothing else, the least I expect is for the girl to put in effort into the conversation and as a plus, remember something about me from my profile or our chats. The problem I have is that despite putting in all the effort, it keeps failing for stupid reasons (2nd para). Guys deserve to be respected too by the way.-#100671: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100671","['Like: 100 people', 'Care: 27 people', 'Haha: 23 people']",80 comments,13 shares
100670,"My boyfriend is bi and his exes were all guys. I'm aware and don't have any issues with his sexuality.Recently I got to know one of his close friends and he briefly shared that my boyfriend was the bottom in all his relationships and hook ups. I thought he was kidding but he laughed it off and said I can ask my boyfriend if I don't believe.I'm a bit thrown off as my boyfriend looks like the top in a gay relationship instead. He's tall, fit, tanned and is quite well endowed down there. I didn't ask him directly initially and snooped around his room when I stayed over. While rummaging through belongings, I found his d**do and it's bigger than mine... wtf.I confronted him about the d**do and asked him about his bottom status and he didn't even deny. He said he likes the feeling from receiving and uses the d**do now for his own pleasure now that he's attached with me. He even clarified that's where the male g spot is and there's nothing to be ashamed receiving pleasure from there. The only taboo is straight people might see it as gay, which he emphasises is not as it's an anatomy thing.He also reassured me that he enjoys s** with me and has never betrayed me with any guys. I trust him on this.I tried to move pass all of this but it's challenging, especially when we have s**. I will imagine him being penetrated and dominated and I just lose all my interest in s**with him. I just cannot unsee and unhear that he's a bottom.My sub conscious self also tells me that he's less manly and can't provide me with the security I need. I know it's selfish of me to think this way but I can't help it.Anyone who has the same experience or has advice on how I should deal with this?-#100670: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100670","['Haha: 142 people', 'Like: 99 people']",156 comments,108 shares

100665,"My bf and I just broken up 2 months ago and I still can’t get over it. We have been tgt for 6 years and I am always the one talking about future planning. He would just keep quiet and follow the flow. Our BTO is ready next year so plan was to get married this or next year. He already bought ring (under my pressure because I wanna get married and house is ready next year) then I realized he giving me cold treatment and doesn’t talk to me. I feel something is amiss and I always ask him if something is going on and if he has anything to tell me. But he always no, he said he loves me. That’s all he said. I take his reply face value so I thought nothing is wrong. Only after I found out he is texting and going out with dates with his colleagues. He is flirting with her and bring her out to eat and play. To my horror because I trust him so much and never thought he is a cheater. After I found out, he texted me to breakup and we will not be the same as last time because trust is broken. He didn’t even ask for forgiveness and chance to get back to me. Thinking back, I guess he already cheated on me 1-2 years back but I was kept in the dark. Our s** life has deteriorated that I am the one initiated and got rejected. His answer is he has low s**drive or he is tired. He doesn’t feel turn on or passionate anymore. So I think he cheated back then because he is getting s** somewhere else. I feel that I am really dumb and took so long to realize something is wrong with us. He is a habitual liar and he lies without blinking his eyes. I only found out his true color after we broke up. The tone and attitude changed so much that I could not believe he is the one I love for so many years. So the lesson I learnt is that when you feel that the s** drive change, it is a red alert that he is getting s** outside. Also if you feel that he doesn’t talk to you or reply you as fast as last time. It is probably he is talking or texting other girls. Never trust guys who can sweet talk and give promises easily. They know girls will be happy and believe them. They can stay on the relationship with girlfriend but still have FWB and hookups with no string attached. Why men can’t control their little bro and be loyal to only one girl? Is it really so difficult for men? Women youth is very precious and they are wasting their time by keeping her while cheating outside. Guys should be more responsible and be morally upright! I can’t accept Hookups and FWB is it because I am too conservative? Should I be more open minded and not judge? I have no idea is it my issue or society issue anymore. Ethically I feel that s** is intimate connection with the one you love. Am I am too outdated? Human nature needs sex I can understand. But with strangers I can’t, I feel it’s dirty and disgusting. I can’t kiss someone I don’t know let alone having sex.-#100665: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100665","['Like: 154 people', 'Care: 67 people', 'Sad: 49 people']",110 comments,67 shares

100649,"TLDR: s** drive & pregnancy dispute between bf and IJust want to know where to draw the line? My boyfriend and I are in uni year 1 and we have been rather busy with our lives.. on top of that I have my internship as well and he's working part time outside. However… because we have so little time together, we often eat out and he would drive me to explore new places and that would be our little date. We are just like a normal couple with normal love life.What's not so normal with us is that my bf has an extremely high sex drive.. while on the other hand I'm the one with the disgustingly low sex drive but I cant help it.. I would often ask myself if I'm asexual but no.. if I were to drink I would want to make out with someone & maybe hook up once in a blue moon (but not when I'm in relationship of course) but to him I'm just.. no ;-; I love him but I'm just not s**ually attracted to him I guess… It is especially so that I'm someone of prochoice. I have a life to live and I'm just 20… I dont want to be tied down with a baby so fast.. I have yet to travel the world (well… due to covid) and I wish to have the chance to at least visit some countries before I settle down  I had a pregnancy scare about 2 months ago and I told him that if anything happens, I’ll be going for abortion as I'm not financially stable, & I do not wish to bring an innocent life to the world & throw them to my parents / their grandparents because I'm incapable of giving them a stable decent childhood in their early years (also I wont be there for them </3) He told me I was immature and I will ‘grow out if this idea once I really bear a child’ but no.. I really do not wish to bring a child to the world just yet because I'm not ready. you can tell me ‘no one is ever ready for a child’ I agree. but not when I wont be there when they mutter their ‘ mama ‘ or ‘ papa ‘ or that I have to throw them to their grandparents or that I'm not financially stable enough (to even support myself in Uni ??? ) Anyways.. because of this we fought (eventually my crimson wave came) but I was utterly turned off by him.. we used to be able to do it every week (at least) then it turned into every few weeks, then now its almost been a month and a half since we last did the ‘deed’ (heard from my friends its actually not normal?) He told me I was being unfair to his feelings and I'm invalidating them  but I just dont feel like having s** with him anymore for fear of pregnancy scare and I dont know… just dont feel like doing it ;-; he is someone that cannot live without sexual intimacy, I told him that if he wants he can get his needs elsewhere.. but he doesn't want to What else can I do to heighten my s**ual drive.. sometimes I feel bad for him but I'm just not.. you know turned on ;(I even questioned if we are really compatible .. :,)-#100649: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/100649","['Like: 19 people', 'Care: 9 people', 'Haha: 3 people']",31 comments,9 shares
