My partner has just left for overseas studies and we will have to do LDR for about a year.

99812,"Ladies, i need advice on what to do when you really hate a certain group of people that your partner hangs out with.For context, i came to know from a mutual friend that these 2 friends of my boyfriend's have been bitching about me . My boyfriend is aware of it as well. These 2 guys are obnoxious sexists who diss their girlfriends, their friends' girlfriends and generally almost the entire female population, and even claimed that females only exist for the purpose of reproduction. I also found out that when my boyfriend meets up with them, they bombard him with bad points about me (some are true and some are made up stories) as if they are trying to destroy our relationship. I'm sure i have not offended them in any way, maybe just a little hostile towards them due to their narcissistic characters. While i do not wish to be the petty girlfriend who controls who my boyfriend chats/hang out with, i find myself getting bothered that he actually chose to engage with that kind of friends. Y'know when you rant to a genuine friend they will empathize and offer solutions, but this kind of friends just add oil to fire and sprout some nonsense they do not have to take responsibility for. I openly told my boyfriend that i do not like that those friends are not respecting me and our relationship, but he kind of brushes it off. I know that i can stand up for myself by confronting the friend but at this point i do not want to do it without his knowledge first.We have plans to BTO soon but I'm not sure if this issue will become a big problem in the future. I'm not so confident that my boyfriend will continue to love me the same if he constantly hears negative false rumours about me. What if he chooses to believe those friends instead  Thoughts?-#99812: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99812","['Like: 13 people', 'Haha: 5 people', 'Care: 1 person']",25 comments,2 shares
99811,"As a year 4 FASS student, I really think we should care and oppose the mergers that have already took place (CHS) and will take place (YNC-USP and FoE/SDE). And it's not for the reasons I see many here suppose that I would think.Many people think that the point to be upset over is somehow students & staff losing some form of elitism and privilege that comes with the 'Yale' or 'USP' name, but that's not it. I think Yale-NUS students are indeed, very elitist. But that's NOT the point to tackle. Anyone defending Yale-NUS on that basis is terrible. It's NOT about maintaining elitist, exclusive, privileged spaces. Rather, it's how NUS affects ALL of us.The point is how ridiculous it is for students & staff to have seriously LITTLE SAY, if they have any say at all, in how NUS is run, and how they can't control these drastic effects to their curriculum and education. There's one department that I know of (Geography) that has had almost all of their 2k modules wiped out due to CHS. This affects one's academics in terms of S/Us they can get in their major, not to mention Y1/2 students who had to radically shift their academic plans due to this. Academic staff from other disciplines had to also make rapid shifts in their curriculum, and student's actual autonomy in how interdisciplinary they can be is being forced down a single, common track instead of having variety in their learning interests. Students & staff were going to be heavily affected, but NUS admin steamrolled us without allowing us an opportunity to say 'no'. And mergers and common curriculum is just one aspect of it.Remember how many people raised issues about S/Us being limited in our 2nd Covid semester? Or how school fees remained unchanged despite a mostly (if not fully) online semester and pressure from students? Or how it had to take students going to social & mainstream media, making it a nationwide issue, for NUS to make changes to their policies on sexual misconduct? There are many more things that NUS forces onto us without our consent, and despite our opposition, they hold all the power to make these sudden changes to our student lives without letting us have a say on whether this is right or not.I'm against these mergers because I'm against how NUS is run in general. No competent institution would make major changes to a large number of their faculties/colleges without properly consulting those to be heavily affected. Anyone that thinks this is a Yale-NUS issue should look at a wider picture of how draconian NUS is in their operations. It's affected me, because it's emblematic of what I've seen in my 3+ years here. A university that has zero care or love for it's students.-#99811: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99811","['Like: 42 people', 'Love: 5 people']",6 comments,8 shares

99807,"I abstained from the conversation about YNC's closure but as a member of the first-ever graduating class of the college I just want to remind us all that while the emotional impact of the closure of our school is akin to that of losing a loved one, not all of us are emotionally affected by the decision to the same degree. I'm sure most YNC graduates are like me, i.e we know that our lives are probably not going to be impacted much as our diplomas still bear the name of NUS. The accusations that YNC trains their students to be whiny about small things isn't true in the slightest, Singapore does.To all my fellow YNC alumni, let's not try to whitewash the fact that part of the reason we chose (or our parents chose) to attend YNC is because of the name, ""Yale."" I don't know many people who would have chosen to attend YNC had it been named Singapore University of Liberal Arts a la SUSS. It doesn't help to keep on overcompensating. If we really were that good, many of us would've taken the need-blind route to the Ivies.Let's just move on shall we. The incessant SJW behavior on these comments trying to justify your outrage isn't doing YNC any favours. Yes, the college is gone and there's some nostalgia. But don't pretend that we are annoyed for what this means for Singapore society at large. Every year hundreds of Singaporeans come back with Ivy League degrees. Even if we assumed that YNC students are of the same vintage as Ivy League graduates, Singapore will not be much different with 250 less of such ""talent"" each year. ICA can just as easily award 250 more citizenships for Ivy graduates each year.-#99807: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99807","['Like: 23 people', 'Haha: 2 people']",0 Comments,2 comments

99799,"Why does women whose husband had an affair outside always only blame the 小三 (aka mistress)?  When I was younger, I happened to date a married man. At first I didnt know he was married but I found out and he started to tell me the sob story about how his then-gf forced him to marry her by lying to him about being on pills. She got pregnant and said if he doesnt marry her, she will commit suicide. But he was not happy being with her and finds her to be super controlling and psycho. I was dumb then and of course, felt sorry for him. So we dated and eventually his wife found out.The only truth that he said to me was that his wife is indeed a psycho. She threatened me and forced me to apologize to her. At that time, she was pregnant with their second child so I also didnt want to agitate her, so I gave in and apologize to her. However, her husband got away with having an affair and I even heard they have a third kid soon after.Now that I am older, I wonder why did she blame me like it was my fault when it was HER husband who did her wrong. I also heard I was not the only ""affair"" her husband had. He even slept with her own friends and she didnt even find out. So to all married women out there, if your husband is not faithful, no matter how many women you chased away, he will still find someone to cheat on you with.-#99799: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99799","['Like: 125 people', 'Haha: 29 people']",74 comments,21 shares

I'm not going to agree or disagree with his statement but I just want to share my own thoughts and ask for some advice at the same time.I am quite into F.I.R.E, and it's not because of FOMO. I have wanted F.I.R.E even before I knew what it was about. My motivation though is that I'm lazy, which sounds contradictory since F.I.R.E is mostly about chiong-ing. I have a job which I'm relatively comfortable with, I won't say I hate my job, but I wish I never have to work at all. I am willing to trade off less enjoyment for less work. Instead of work hard play hard, I am more of a work little play little kind of person, and if I could I would go for no work no play but still can survive relatively comfortably. Obviously the world doesn't work in accordance to my wishes and I can only adapt to it.I'm aware that my motivation and reasoning may not seem healthy to most people, and I also want to have a 2nd choice in case F.I.R.E fails for me.

99785,"Need some help understanding what the crux of the yale-nus saga is...As a commentator mentioned in one of the previous posts, collaboration with prestigious university is not a new thing, but most of the time it is formed under a new name eg. MIT + presumably NUS = SUTD, Wharton school of business + presumably NUS = SMU.Now how many Yale-NUS students would actually go to Yale-NUS if there isn't the word ""Yale"" in it? If its actually for instance Lee Wei Lin Liberal Arts College, how many people would actually gloss over it and how many people would attend?If you would still attend, then what is the loss? Your degree has been and is still backed by NUS. The curriculum according to NUS would be similar though changed slightly, and its common that curriculum changes as we have seen over the years.If its about the loss of the name ""Yale"", then its a matter of your pursuit of prestige failing. Perhaps NUS should not have over-sold / falsely advertise this programme by using the ""Yale"" name, and this whole saga might have been prevented if its called a different one from the start.

99780,"Executive summary: ""Wake the fuck up."" - Pray Tell, Pose (Season 2, Episode 1)Dear project members,I get it. University is tough. Maybe you're overloading your semester. Maybe you've got CCA. Maybe you've got hall activities. Maybe you're not prioritizing the project because you don't give a shit. Hey, I get it, if you own it and you're self-aware, more power to you. I'm glad you have that personal growth. But maybe you can communicate it to your group members your current position ​so that we know what to expect from your non/marginal/full contribution, if any. If you have not noticed, this is not Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters or Miss Robichaux's Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies - I cannot read your mind and I cannot divine your thoughts. Again, there's nothing wrong if you tell me ""Hey, I'm not invested because of XYZ."" I'd respect you more that way for having honesty. I don't remember signing up to be a part of a trashy TV series where I know what the character is supposed to do but still get frustrated when they don't do it. If I did sign up for a TV series, I would rather be in Xavier's School or Miss Robichaux's Academy. Sadly, there are very few people who are capable of doing that, and I am stuck in reruns of trashy TV series. I mean, if all of us can have great communication, maybe we'd be the utopia some of us have imagined society to be. I am not discounting those who have serious legit issues like mental health, personal issues or physical health issues. I understand that it can be troubling especially when emotions are at play. I take offense however, when people are gallivanting and then at the last minute, try to piece together a project. Or people put on blinders to focus on another module and then magically want to contribute at the last minute. The world does not stop. Manage your priorities and responsibilities. It does not surprise me to hear that sometimes, fresh graduates struggle when entering the work force. Some of the work ethics I see are neither grand prize worthy nor will they snatch any ballroom trophies. I can tell you for a fact that you can get fired for procrastinating. And yeah, maybe when you work, you are paid. So is that it? Money is your motivation? Or climbing the corporate ladder? Is that how you suddenly skyrocket and have that preppy zeal in your work? You're gallivanting now because you're on mummy and daddy's credit card? Or maybe you're complacent because you're on that scholarship and know that your future is secured and that maybe you just need to scrape through? Sink yourself all you want, I respect that decision. But don't bring any of us down. It really boggles me that some people can get amazing grades and have poor work ethics. Is it because you have your seniors or friends copy? Paraphrase the whole lot and submit it for that First Class Honours / Highest Distinction / A+ all in an hour or two? I would love to see how that strategy pans out in the workforce, when you are thrust into the company of strangers. Maybe that's why fresh graduates struggle. They procrastinated the growth they were supposed to have in university to the point that they flounder at their first few months. May the powers that be grant you your fate accordingly.Now, I wish I have a new remote.

99779,"Just wanna seek an avenue to rant. I got divorced in my late 20s, 5 years down the road, still earning a meagre 3.2k salary, no savings (all locked up in insurance), no capability to own a car, doesn't have a high flying career, standing at a mere 1.6m, it's just impossible to find love again. Bread can survive without love, but love cannot survive without bread. I'm still in the midst of upgrading my qualifications to get a better paying job, but till then, this is gonna be a long single lonely road. I too, crave intimacy, not just purely sex. I crave attention, would love being showered with care and concern, having someone there to be there thru good and bad days, cuddle through nights, holding hands while strolling, just being for there for one another. I've tried all sorts of dating apps, I don't get any swipes back. People have introduced their single female friends to me, but they are either away in a different country, or, they are snapped up along the way when their other suitors drives or earns way more than me. I don't blame them, I totally understand. Some tell me, don't look for love, let love find me. Given my current qualities, love will never find me if I don't find love. I am human, I too, need attention, care and love. I just hope someone special that sees the good in me, and overlooks that I am short, poor, not having a high flying career, does not drive.

He never got mad at me and he would always be helpful, caring and understanding towards me, even in the extreme cases. I was always his top priority.

He gets easily impatient with me and nitpicks on things that he never had before. The way he speaks to me and treat me is completely different.

Immediately, the whole conversation changed and they were really paggro whether I really had passion for the job, even sharing examples of how their current trainees doing traineeships were willing to make do with much less. I then tried to turn the question around and ask what they had in mind, or if they could share more details around their compensation structure, but they refused to disclose it, just continuing that msg of passion > pay. Personally, the pay is not the issue here, but the bigger issue is what appears to be very unprofessional behaviour. It would be fair if we have different expectations on pay, I'm all for negotiation and seeing where things go. I've spoken to other employers, and even in times where we don't align on pay expectations, we always kept things professional with none of this paggro behaviour, or using passion and the traineeship programme as a reason to justify paying less.-#99766: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99766",['Like: 102 people'],47 comments,6 shares

99763,"On the YNC merger:As a recent FASS graduate, I think it was unnecessary. Merging the Arts and Science faculties into a combined college, while forced, still had some merit for forcing science and arts majors to take a little bit of mods from the other side, and even my FASS seniors who work in Econs roles now welcome the move cos some of them are working in biomedical policy for the government and now are needing to self-study bio for example, to apply their Econs or GL knowledge to. But YNC already has such an interdisciplinary program for the first 2 years (which is why I avoided that place) and so I don’t see what merit comes from merging the two except for saving money and reducing admin costs. The USP was a residential program with extra modules to help people learn things outside their major but without forcing a full liberal arts platter on them, and had its own set of international double degrees (with Sciences Po, Waseda etc).These were 2 different programs that catered to people who wanted different levels of variety in their learning. FASS/FOS is at one extreme with deep focus on only one type of subject, USP is that + a bit more, and YNC is for those who wanted to dip into everything. So the mergers are reducing choice. I guess it all converges to wanting to produce graduates with more diverse skills, but that doesn’t mean the school has to handhold and force-feed diversity to every student (I believe that there will be more remnants of YNC than USP in the final product). As someone with no emotional investment in either program, I am now after 4 years in FASS, a big believer of interdisciplinary learning. But I don’t necessarily want to take exams for every kind of subject. Coming from FASS I never formally took any math or science after JC, but I self-studied calculus and biochemistry without exam pressure. I think students should be afforded this freedom than to have to do it because of rules.Ultimately the biggest skill one should take away from uni is the ability to learn things fast and without much handholding from a teacher. I think that outside of professional degrees, we just deserve to have a good 4 years honing that skill of self-directed learning in whatever content domain we like, and if you have more eclectic tastes, YNC and USP should exist side by side with the traditional faculties to offer the widest choice. If a FASS major really needed chemistry they can learn it when they need. And if a physicist needs to know Econs for managing research budgets they can learn it then. I would rather see NUS do more to offer continuing education credits than merge faculties.-#99763: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99763","['Like: 33 people', 'Love: 3 people']",2 comments,6 shares
99756,"Is having a good chemistry in a relationship more important than having a loving/caring boyfriend? Have been together with my boyfriend for 4 years. In a stable relationship where there seems to be zero romance. Chemistry is good (same sense of humour and taste) however we no longer go on dates or even spend time as a couple. At some point it seems like he sees me as a friend.  He wouldn’t even bother to check if I am home when I am out with my friends and going home late (1am or later). Sometimes, we can even not meet for weeks and he is okay with it.  Is this normal?I feel tired of being the only one taking the initiatives to maintain the relationship.

And why the limit on credit mappings when a possible SoC minor needs 2 EE modules worth to get 1 of that CS module minor requirement?Computer Engineering is already coded as a Multi-Disciplinary programme, and there is an expectation the students would have base compentency for both hardware and software  to a minimum degree(hopefully). EE does not have anything on CS as a science aside from CS1010E which is just introductory programming.Other (bigger name, though possibly lower ranked) unis have EE and CS together. Not blasting NUS for having separate Schools/Faculties due to how they were initially set up, but of all sorts of interdisciplinary combinations they come up with now they still don't want to let EE with CS minor be an option.Not as groundbreaking as liberal arts degrees, perhaps, but is this prohibition still relevant?-#99755: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99755",['Like: 7 people'],0 Comments,2 comments
99753,"YNC – USP MergerAs someone who studied the humanities in junior college, considers herself a liberal (inb4 “not all YNC students…”) and almost applied to YNC herself, I would have expected to feel more sympathetic to the closure of YNC.  However, the reaction of many YNC students and alumni were frankly off-putting and reinforced some of my impressions of YNC elitism from my time at NUS.  I wish to talk about why this is so, as well as why I support the merger and the formation of New College.As a preliminary note, let’s call the closure a closure.  YNC will effectively cease to exist.  YNC has always been an autonomous college from NUS with its own identity.  People applied to YNC, not to NUS.  In contrast, USP has always been a programme within NUS (although it too has its own identity).  I believe YNC’s autonomous nature and separate identity is a big reason why YNC students have been more vocal and probably feel the pain of closure more acutely than USP students, who have been comparatively stoic in their response.I also wish to acknowledge the pain and sadness that many YNC students and alumni are feeling at losing the community they have built and found self-actualisation in.  Many YNC students and alumni have written movingly on this, and no fair-minded person who has read these accounts can deny these lived experiences.My disagreement is that in their sadness, many Kingfishers have argued against closure in an elitist manner and left out important considerations of financial prudence.  On elitism: -(a) Touting YNC exceptionalism, while slighting/ignoring the work of FASS / NUS.  Prof Daniel Goh has a post on this which I wish to refer you to https://www.facebook.com/daniel.ps.goh/posts/10158382881196430.  While the YNC alumni has subsequently clarified that this was not meant to diss FASS / NUS, I believe that the excerpt cited by Prof Goh speaks for itself in what the author truly meant when he wrote what he wrote (cf. his post hoc justification after being called out).  While the author’s focus was on the loss of YNC and his own experiences at YNC, and I do not believe that he intended to diss FASS/NUS, the fact that the excerpt in question was written is example A of the casual exceptionalism and the subconscious (or otherwise) “better than thou” attitude of some Kingfishers.  Ironically, it would appear that some of the responses by YNC students and alumni have alienated some of the people who would be most sympathetic to their cause.(b) Prejudging the New College.  Some off-putting justifications I’ve read include arguments along the line that the small close-knit community at YNC cannot be replicated at scale by New College.  Or that some other character of the YNC community that made YNC successful will be lost at New College (and indeed it will!).  These arguments tend to be interspersed with moving anecdotal accounts of YNC community life.  They also sometimes come with sweeping statements catastophising what the closure of YNC means for education / critical education / the liberal arts in Singapore.  (Please, the idea of a liberal arts has been done by USP long before YNC came along).(c) These arguments seem to assume that YNC is the gold standard for a “liberal arts” education.  If you start from the premise that YNC is the gold standard, then New College will always fall short in some respect, because New College is emphatically not YNC and does not aspire to be.  I have also not seen many recognition on the Kingfishers’ part that New College will be a merger of USP and YNC, with the exception of this thoughtful piece in the Octant: https://theoctant.org/.../from-curd-to-butter-to-ghee-on.../ (d) On the point of dissing NUS and elitism, there was even a piece in the Octant that was later password locked and then (I think) taken down in which the author disses the New College students by saying, “…we won’t be able to barricade ourselves against the incoming cohort of ‘New College’ students and the NUS overreach they bring with them.” (Read: YNC bourgeoisie barricading themselves in their palatial campus against the hoi polloi NUS hoarde)On the issue of financial prudence, it’s been an open secret that YNC survives on MOE funding and the cost per student is prohibitively expensive.  Good things don’t come cheap – the nice campus, low class sizes and a 4-year (subsidised) residence don’t come cheap.  And yes - it is subsidised (even for those not on FA) - because the tuition fees don’t even come close to covering the cost per student.  Please see this twitter thread by a YNC professor, which makes the case that YNC has failed to hit its financial goals by probably a wide margin: https://mobile.twitter.com/.../status/1431832560213102592... In short, while many a Kingfishers may have found self-actualisation and meaning and more in the YNC community, the community is propped up with taxpayers money and the Government has a duty to spend taxpayers money wisely.  I think a big consideration would be the number of students benefiting from the monies.  Should Singapore continue to spend large sums of money for a select few in YNC, or can the same amount be utilised to bring more students to the liberal arts and the humanities at the New College?  Even if the education at New College is a watered down version of a “Yale” liberal arts education (Also Kingfishers – that’s not a very post-colonial argument of you eh ????), if it benefit more students, I think that would be money well spent.  Ironically, the elitist and cocooned responses to the closure of YNC only reinforces in my mind the argument that the monies would be better spent on New College, rather than on a selected few.In short, I feel bad for the YNC students and alumni, who have lost their community (in a sense, because of course it lives on in them).  But the practical and financial consideration necessitates your loss.  Let’s use the resources to benefit more students, in a responsible manner.  P.S. I make no comments on the way the announcement was made, which seems to be to be a slightly separate topic for a separate post.-#99753: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99753",['Like: 80 people'],8 comments,25 shares
99752,"Guys... Does this count as gaslighting?Sometimes when I'm eating with my girlfriend, i find that she tends to try really hard to convince me that a certain taste which she prefers is better and therefore more superior. For example, I personally prefer spicier food but when we discuss about whatever we are eating, she proceeds to dish out a few reasons why i shouldn't think that way. I get that everyone has different tastebuds but i really wished she would stop shooting down my opinions.Another thing is, sometimes she says that i am too narrow minded when i do not think or do what she wants me to do. If I'm ranting about a colleague, instead of empathizing with me, she just says things like 'aiya it's just in your head lah' BUT when she's the one bitching about her friends it's totally fine. When i called her out, there were even instances when she said 'thats why you should go speak to your counselor, your emotions wouldn't be so messed up anymore'. (I saw a counselor a few times for some other reasons) On the other hand, she claims that she's a very open minded person and even confidently told me that some of her friends also agree but tbh, if she's open minded then why can't she accept my opinions?From my observations, my girlfriend's mum is also leaning towards the manipulative side. I'm not sure if she picked that up since childhood. Can anyone please advise me on how to let her see that she's hurting me?

99751,"If I were a parent, I would totally expose my children to sex education early. Boy: to teach him how to wear a condom. How to make himself feel good aka masturbate. Maybe even introducing him to some tenga. It's normal to feel pleasure. Nothing to be embarrassed about.Girl: even though I'm a guy, I'm still aware of the monthly menstrual cycle that ladies have. When that happens, don't even need to wait for the mother to appear. I'll bring her to the supermarket to buy pads. I've seen so many fathers and guys shun the pad section. Come on. It's like diapers. It absorbs stuff. What's so scary about it. The older generation thinks touching it is not good and suay but hello? It's a product please. I'll help her read reviews and what not to help her decide on the pad she wants. Similar to guys, I'll also tell her about condoms and safe sex. Always. ALWAYS make sure the guy wears a condom. No condom just kick the balls and go. It's ok to teach children about sex at an early age, maybe around 16-18. It's the period when they explore and know more about their bodies. What's so embarrassing about it? Last but not least, I'll make an agreement with them: when you are at home, if you are doing something ordinary, like watching YouTube or Netflix, you can open door for air ventilation. If you want full on privacy to 'discover' yourself, close the door and lock it. If you are studying or working and don't want to be disturbed, close the door and leave it ajar a bit, using a door stopper. Not going to spy on you. Not going to harp on you. Just be sure that whatever you do, be safe and not harm anyone. It's about time the conventional mindset of sex gets replaced with new ones. Oh and just a note, not even going to care if my children or lesbians or gays, love is all that matters.

99747,"I wish to stand up for the F&Bs on campus, cos I feel like they are so essential but so overlooked in NUS. I enjoy striking up conversations with canteen aunties and staff from cafes & restaurants. I feel their pain when they share how the past 18 months have been for them.A few points to bring up for discussion:1. NUS doesn't allow visitors. This rule is stricter than government mandated - our vendors lose customers from nearby Science Parks, general public, etc. Though this appears discretionary on the part of NUS, no further rental rebate has been given to compensate for this (I verified with several stalls/sources)2. Saturation of vendors. Every now and then, some new space is up for tender at some corner of campus. I mean, who doesn't love more variety right?! The issue is that the size of the pie remains the same. So some vendors face the problem of competitors selling the same stuff in their vicinity. Not a great look for them, especially since there's low volume on campus nowadays. But hey, maybe NUS is pressurising their leasing office to raise revenue?3. The attitude of NUS towards vendors. Don't @ me, the vendors I talked to only agreed to divulge some stuff after I sumpa I won't reveal any clues on who they are. On top of demanding strict compliance to rules that they make up, NUS' stance is generally along the lines of ""if you don't follow, then this will factor in when this space is up for retender. We don't forget de..."" In this climate where F&B vendors are at their literal wits' end on how to keep their business going, the least they can do is not to pile on even more stress?! I fear that serious operators who are running a great show now may not have the money to sustain or go up against the marketing dollars of big brands (which NUS lovesssss). How do I know? Cos my parents belong in this category. I want them to keep doing what they're passionate about, but I know they're facing an uphill battle.Jiayou!!!!!~-#99747: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99747","['Like: 25 people', 'Care: 7 people', 'Sad: 3 people']",1 comment,4 shares
99744,"The only people deserving of any attention as a result of their lives being affected by the closure of YNC are the people to whom the school was the only source of income. Period. Everyone else is just overreacting. Did I miss the part where they announced that all YNC diplomas will no longer be recognized? Did I miss the part where it is suddenly technologically possible to confiscate the memories of the college experience of YNC graduates and students? We had universities close down before. JCs merge all the time. Primary schools are shut down all the time. Why is it that the dissolution of an institution that has only been around for 10 years is causing an uproar that we’d only expect if they announced Harvard was gonna shut down? I’ve always heard rumors that YNC students were snobby and elitist. But only after reading through the unending stream of whingy and incredibly (and unnecessarily) long status updates of my JC friends who went to YNC have I truly understood how much these people really think they go to Yale. It is also now clear that for a group of people who like to use the word “privilege,” they certainly have great difficulty checking their own.I know people who have gone to the real Ivies in the US. My neighbor went to the University of Pennsylvania. A PSC scholar friend of mine did her masters at some other Ivy, maybe Cornell. I never got the sense that they were a fraction as self-righteous as YNC graduates. Now why is that? Is the education at YNC really that much more liberal compared to actual liberal arts colleges in the land of the free? Or is it instead true that people who attended the really Ivies are better able to make the much-needed distinction between things that matter and things that do not matter that much. Surely there are other things to spend time and energy campaigning for? I get that you’re pissed that your school is shutting down. But honestly, have a sense of damn proportion. Everyone who has ever earned a degree at Yale-NUS would have more history themselves than the school has. This isn’t just me being facetious. We gotta be able to point out things that don’t make sense. As willing as I am to empathize with the importance of history and culture, YNC has none of either. Just because your school has closed down doesn’t invalidate the experiences you had at the school. I mean, even if NUS announced it was gonna shut down tomorrow I’d just be interested in whether my degree will still be recognized.

I met many unsavoury people there, and want to avoid them as much as I can. Of course, that’s still no reason to close a college.Went to their open house about two years ago with my sister (my sister’s a liberal arts kinda person and believed that YNC > FASS). The professors there were super snobbish and the vibe there was also pretty unwelcoming as well. To this day, I still fucking hate the guys that treated my little sister like dirt for the 15 minutes we were there.And they were pretty superficial as well. I tend to speak in a more formal and polished accent than my little sister, so even though I wasn’t interested in YNC at all they somehow treated me better than my sister. It was the shittiest open house I’ve ever been toI mean, there’s also the somewhat substantial probability I’m biased against YNC students due to this experience, but for the love of god I can’t stand it when the people I know who attended YNC speak out as if they’re holier than thou.A much, much better and down-to-earth argument would have been that you were scammed into thinking that the Yale-NUS degree conferred great employment opportunities and merging into USP was NOT what you signed up for when your first enrolled into it.The arguments made about Yale-NUS being the safe space for discussions is a huge reach.

Whenever im in any sort of pain, even when I am suffering from period cramps occasionally, he will drop what he have to buy the required items to ease my pain while accompanying me until I get better. Those traits of him never change -  he is a fantastic guy and I really appreciate and love him so much, but now that we are adults, there is one big problem about our relationship.He is always unmotivated and have no drive when it comes to studies and career since he was young. For the past 11 years, I always try to motivate him, encourage him to put in effort with his studies and always reminding him that we will be growing and pushing through this together. I tried my best to play my part and today, I managed to grad from medicine so I was hoping he will try his best too, But after many years, he haven change much.

Am i not even allowed to voice my opinion in front of him anymore?It seems to me that he is always constantly angry or triggered about something with his speeches about social injustice, as if the world owes him a living.I am really at my limit but is there anything i can do to help him to become more open to opposing view?Ps: feels bad to say this but i was low key happy to see Yale-Nus close down as i really think that school was the root of his change.-#99699: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99699","['Like: 66 people', 'Haha: 63 people']",40 comments,10 shares
99697,"Hi there. I’m not sure if I’m in the right job. A few weeks into my job role, the job scope I was hired for was moved to another department within my organization. Why I was not moved there - because my headcount is under the current department I’m in. So I was thrown all the other work to do, things that are completely not within my expertise. I’ve been trying to learn for the past 10 months and I feel like my patience is running out.. there are so many things that I feel so lost in and there’s completely no guidance by seniors or my boss at work, because they’re just too busy. In my recent work review, my boss said I am very quiet and low key, and I highlighted to her I’m trying to learn on the job. I think the comment really discouraged me as I can’t seem to speak anything during meetings for the fear of saying the wrong things. I don’t think I should leave this job so early at 10 months because I believe I should gain more experience, yet the lack of exposure and me constantly feeling so lost at work makes me feel so useless. I am stuck between finding another job or stick to this job for another year before searching for other opportunities. I’m sure many people have experienced this before, would kindly appreciate advice on it. Prof Ben, do you have any advice? Thank you.-#99697: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99697","['Like: 6 people', 'Care: 2 people', 'Sad: 1 person']",12 comments,3 shares
99696,"I don't get why there are so many posts complaining about unwanted pregnancies. I know the sex ed in sg is bad, but don't they always tell you condoms are not 100% effective? The only 100% effective way is abstinence. If you don't have sex, you can't get pregnant, simple as that.FYI, I'm not coming at it from a religious perspective here (I'm an atheist). But the fact is that as girls, the burden of unwanted pregnancy is 99% going to be borne by us. Both the pregnancy itself, and the childcare that comes after.Yes there's always the possibility of abortion. Don't get me wrong, abortion is always preferable to giving birth to an unwanted child, and I'm glad it's legal in sg. But it also costs time and money, and might lead to complications affecting your long-term health and fertility. None of which the guy has to bother about, of course.If a guy doesn't want to be a father, he can just run. You can't run from your own body. Sure, you can go to court and drag him for child support, but that takes months and thousands in lawyer fees. Or maybe your families force you to get married, which never ends well if the child is the only factor tying you two together, dooming you to decades of an unhappy marriage. Is it worth it for five minutes of pleasure?And if a guy insists that you must have sex because it's what bf/gf do/all his ex-gfs did it...dump his ass.

99694,"[Controversial] This is in response to those who argue that Yale-NUS students are living in their own bubble because they did not bother fighting for other schools' (i.e. CHS) mergers and were not even concerned about the mergers of JCs a few years back. I am saying this as a FASS student. They are not obliged to fight against other schools' mergers - after all, it's not even their school. Why are we expecting Yale-NUS students to fight for our schools first, to gain the 'right' to fight for their school? In the first place, why are we expecting Yale-NUS students to fight for our school? Do we expect NTU students to fight against NUS' decision of merging Yale-NUS and USP too? I really don't see a problem for Yale-NUS students to be extra 'loud' when it comes to their own school's merger, it just shows that they really care a lot about their school and hence are willing to fight for it. FASS and FoS have a large student population. We could have been 'loud' even without Yale-NUS students' support, but we weren't. Can we really say that Yale-NUS students are being selfish for not fighting together with us when most of us haven't really done much to fight against our school's merger? Another common argument I see online is that Yale-NUS students are whining over their loss of history and culture, but their feelings are invalid because other JCs with longer history have merged without much issues. Yale-NUS students supposedly have a 'holier than thou attitude', and they would be better off crying about the loss of their prestige so that it won't be hypocritical. I am pretty sure they did cry about their loss of prestige though (which is very understandable in my opinion, after all, they managed to enter Yale-NUS which has a super low acceptance rate). If you read the articles, you might have noticed that some of them rejected top schools around the world for Yale-NUS. Imagine paying such a huge opportunity cost (rejecting top schools, paying large tuition fees, etc.) only to get a degree from a college that will be defunct a few years later. While it may not be a big deal for your primary/secondary/JC to close down, it is a pretty big deal for your university to close down. Do you think employers give more fucks about your pri/sec/JC education over your university education?Back to the point on how Yale-NUS' history is comparably short in contrast with other merged JCs, I just want to highlight that the point here is not about how old the institutions are, but how strong the connection between current students and alumni are. Speaking from personal experience, since we only spend 2 years of our lives in JC and don't really get to connect with the alumni, we don't really form a connection with our JC's history - even if it's longer. In contrast, Yale-NUS has a strong alumni network, their students are also more invested in the college's development and culture, and hence it makes sense as to why they would be more concerned about the college's history and culture.Lastly, please stop making arguments along the lines of ""Back when JCs/faculties/schools merged, did YNC students even care? Did they not care because it doesn't concern them?"" I mean, duh? Are you trying to say that in order to fight for their school to not close down, they should have fought against the school mergers back in 2019, when some of them were NOT even in YNC? Are we really expecting Yale-NUS students to fight for every cause remotely relevant to them? I'm sure many of us don't, because if they do, we will see them as ""noisy, liberal arts students who want to have a say in everything and disrupt our society."" I think we are really expecting too much from them. As much as we believe they live in a bubble (yes, I think they do sometimes), but these arguments are really unfair to YNC students. I hope that before we argue against their cause, we should ask ourselves if we are being overly harsh, just because we think they are royalties who deserve to learn more about how harsh the world can be.-#99694: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99694",['Like: 19 people'],0 Comments,1 comment
99690,"Hi all, to preface this post, I've never been in a relationship or confessed to anyone before.

I'm telling A that I'm not sure if I have feelings or that I'm confused so that A can reject me and I can move on. I'm also not interested in being a relationship with A if my feelings happen to be reciprocated. Main reason being I'm still unsure after thinking for a while.....Wondering if it is selfish to ask for a rejection? Would this affect our friendship?

He says that they do the same thing over at NUS FASS, studying the works of all sorts of thinkers, from Foucault and Sartre to Marx and Nietszche, and is able to dialogue on all sorts of issues and expressly their views freely. He says he being the shock jock of the faculty, could even say things like ""the Telebans are good for the governance of Afghanistan"", or that ""Lim Chin Siong would have been a better leader for Singapore"" in open lecture without the ISA breaking down the doors to the lecture theatre and going ""Hands up! You're under arrest!"" Supposedly, according to him, this is not 'liberal' enough because such discourse was not conducted under the auspices of the good ol' Wypipo at Yale-NUS where wealthy parents fork out a fortune to send their privileged kids to. Imagine the irony of critiquing the disparity of social privileges in one of these 'liberal arts' class without realizing the manifestation of such disparity being in one's midst, oneself being the ultimate embodiment of it.As someone who studied at the faculty of Law at NUS, I can only imagine I will be pretty peeved too if something equivalent were to happen with NUS Law; Say the establishment of a Yale-NUS equivalent of Law School with it being pitched as being superior in its legal education to NUS Law per se simply because it has the word 'Yale' to its branding and some bunch of Americans coming around flaunting themselves as being so much better at teaching the subject than our local professors.

99675,"It is so painful to see that the public believes we are hurt just because of having “Yale” taken out of our name. If it was just about the name, I am sure we couldn’t care less. We grief for our community, which is being shut down by NUS without being warned or any chance for input. Our own president was not informed in advance. Our professors were not informed in advance. The press released articles on the so called “merger” literally 5 minutes befor TEC announced it in a very wordy and lengthy town hall which was more like a monologue - this means even the press knew about this before the main stakeholders. NUS pressured us to pay our fees in multiple emails prior to August 27th, and released this statement on the payment deadline. Students who could have transferred out were prevented from doing so. Internationals who came to Singapore to receive a world class education found their school shut down in week 2 of classes. We hurt for our admin and admissions staff, who now seem reduntant since there will not be any new applicants. We hurt for all the organizations and movements we have started, such as SUs during Covid (yes YNC StuGov fought so hard for it,  it carried over to NUS) or our very strict sexual misconduct policies. All of these efforts will now go to waste. Our siblings will not be able to witness the relationships and community we have built. We will not be able to come back in 10-15 years to look at our alma mater. THIS is what we are upset about, not just some name change.PS, there are people at this school whose first choice has always been YNC, and they didn’t even apply to Yale.

While being together with me, he tend to express his insecurities and he blames himself for projecting his past relationship failures onto me.

99671,"Dear all, please help as I am in a dilemma. 2 weeks ago I found out I was pregnant after my period didn’t come and I took a few pregnancy tests which all came back positive. I haven’t disclosed this to anyone yet.I am currently working full time and studying part time for my masters degree at NUS. I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years. Since last year he has been hinting at starting a family as he is in his 30s already. I told him I still wanted to further my studies and wasn’t very interested in having children. He has always been against me taking up an additional degree saying it’s a drag and useless. I didnt really care since I’m paying with my own savings. The thing is, whenever we have sex it’s always with protection. But over this weekend when my boyfriend was out, I had some suspicions and found that his stash of condoms had a few tiny holes and also a sewing needle under the box. Right now I’m feeling so lost, I can’t concentrate at work or school. I’m so angry that he deliberately got me pregnant but at the same time what can I do if I confront him right? I’m already pregnant! I’m barely halfway through this degree, and now I’m just thinking if I will ever be able to graduate. All the effort, the tens of thousands of dollars forked out all gone down the drain. At 25 I’m not ready to handle the responsibilities of having a child but at the same time I don’t think I could go down the abortion route… I would just feel too guilty given that I’m no longer a child and am financially able to. Ive never wanted to be a mother, never considered having kids, but now that I’m actually pregnant I just feel so guilty, lost and conflicted. Anyone has similar experiences?

99665,"Hi I need some legal advice on non-competition clauses.Background: I'm currently working in a media company. In my job contract, there is a non-competition clause which states that I'm not allowed to work for another media company for a period of 2 years after I leave this company. The non-competition clause goes on to list basically every media company in Singapore. I was offered this job fresh out of graduation and while I was uncomfortable with the non-competition clause, I signed the contract anyway because I really needed a job. I was afraid if I brought up this issue during the job offer stage, they would retract the offer since this non-competition clause is a standardised clause for everyone in this company and so I didn't want to seem difficult.But now that I'm ready to leave this company, this non-competition clause is a real cause for concern for me as it severely limits my future career prospects. I just feel it's extremely unreasonable for this company to have such a clause, which effectively destroys our career progression. The experience I gained in this company is most relevant to other media companies, but if I'm not allowed to apply for other media companies, then I have very limited options for my next job. This company also claims to care for its employees and prioritise employee welfare, but then it has such exploitative conditions that shows that they don't actually care much for our career prospects.I have lawyer friends who jump from one law firm to another law firm as well as accountant friends who jump from one accounting firm to another accounting firm. But I'm not allowed to jump to another media company? Is this non-competition clause common in the media industry?

Frankly speaking, I’m quite tired of the talking stage and I feel that many girls nowadays expect too much from a guy so I rather be single and focus on myself. All was well till I met a girl from rjc and with her, it changed my perspectives on casual relationships because I felt so comfortable with her. We were FWB’s for a brief period and when she left, I was disheartened because I felt as if I lost someone precious to me but not in a relationship sense. I felt like I lost someone that I could share everything to and not feel bothered by it. I don’t really care about the sex either but really the feeling of having someone has been in my mind ever since. As hard as I try to be contended just by myself by doing the things I love to do, I find myself thinking about these kind of romantic stuff when I’m bored and it’s quite depressing when you’re bored and alone.

They simply scare people despise them, borrow to buy and go for expensive meals to post on fb or Instagram. Just to show off that they are doing well but actually not.

But you can see them buy this buy that go holiday, shopping and post that their kids go 1 round of the shopping mall can spend few hundred bucks. I really don’t understand why they can’t just pay off the debt and enjoy later. Imagine their income 3-4K per month and owe credit card and bank loan about 20-40k.

None of you organised any solidarity for us and it really is because, in my honest opinion, that you are trapped in your own bubble that you people are better than us, a true bastion of whatever liberty or humanities or social sciences. You made it sound as if with the dissolution of YNC meant that liberal views and all that is dead. News flash: A FASS community till exists.This is exactly why many do not sympathise with your cause, as much as NUS workings are unethical. This incident exposes how out of touched you people are in your ivory towers. It shows that you are only quick to criticise when your own interests are affected. I mean, who cares about FASS right?

Less the other Uni partnerships, couple years back when JCs were forced to merge, why weren’t people as upset if it were truly about the ‘loss of a community that you’ve spent the past (almost) decade building’?Most of the JCs that were forced to merge have more history than YNC. Not to mention it affected a lot more people. Is it because the JCs that were forced to merge didn’t concern you guys so you guys don’t bother? Although it is unfortunate that such is happening, the amount of despair  and outcry is disproportionate and frankly annoying. Perhaps it is befitting of a liberal arts school, if you take a second, that it’s students moan and begrudge over what is ultimately a business decision, made by a university, with a board that prioritises revenue and profit. But this holier than thou attitude is exactly why it invites criticisms.

They did not close down. FASS Club and Science Club are still here. The College of Humanities and Sciences is NOT a merger between FASS and FOS! It is the creation of a common curriculum between the two entities and allowing students who want to take majors across both faculties an easier path. Is that not expanding options for students? Is that not what these people want? To claim that such mergers will restrict academic programmes is completely unfounded. In fact, it is the breaking down of barriers!

At first, I voiced out that I am not well versed in preparing materials for clients as I am handling normal B2C social media. My boss said that she will provide me guidance.

Today, in a general meeting, I gathered my courage to ask if I can collaborate with the sales team to come up with the presentation for clients. The sales lady happily agreed. However, my boss immediately rejected her and said I could do it alone. I was really disappointed because I believed that the sales teams could provide valuable insights to my presentation.

Whether you had spent time building the culture and identity is irrelevant. It was never necessary for the university to be transparent about their future plans because while their affiliates will be affected (in this case not much as their degrees will still be recognised), YNC students and alum are not decision-makers of the organisation.

Nowhere in the contract was it implied that the university has a responsibility to ensure its management decisions are publicised. My father’s primary school does not exist anymore. My father also went to Nanyang University, which also doesn’t exist anymore. What’s the big deal? You chose to go to a school that was less than 10 years old. You’re telling me you didn’t half-entertained the possibility that it was going to fail? YNC is not a public listed company.

99638,"Dating and finding a partner is toxic. This is my personal experience. Every other aspect of my life is pretty great actually. I work in a 9-6 job and the pay is average but should be sufficient to run a family. Work is interesting and fun despite the average pay. My work ends strictly at 6 so I don't have to think about work after that. After that, I go home and exercise. I am not Dwayne Johnson but I have a average fit body. I also help my parents with the chore and/or just spend time talking to them. After that, I spend time on my hobby.My passion is miniature painting which is a little costly but I am able to save up to indulge. It is so so much fun designing and painting/sculpting/modeling miniatures that I can think of a gazillion ways to do things. I spend quite a lot of time working on my hobby and often enter the ""zone"".On weekends, I spend time with nephews and nieces. I teach them math and sciences and/or just play with them board games/sports like badminton. Since I am teaching them, they have stopped going to tuition and  I used to do volunteering but I had to stop after COVID unfortunately. I do look forward to doing volunteering work once the situation gets better.In all, I feel very satisfied, fulfilled and happy with the way my life is now. However, I have had a terrible experience with the dating part. I am above 30 so age is one factor. I am not that great looking. I have been said to be the most ugliest guy in my class both in secondary and jc. I have stood in a line of 13 guys where I was ranked last in terms of looks. I am also balding due to age so the front part of my head is thinning very badly that you can see it a couple of meters away.Despite all the negative aspects of my looks, I try to do my best and stay positive. I am taking some pills given by the doctor to slow down the balding. I try to dress as well as I can. My initial experience with dating apps were quite bad. I had no matches. My friends were getting matches and were already on dates. I asked my friends for advice. They asked me to remove pics of me painting miniatures which was my hobby. They asked me to take a pic of me with a dog. They also asked me to change my dressing style although initially, my dressing style was similar to most of my friends. Amazingly, I started to get a few matches although the number was very low. There were 2 dressing styles that worked. The first one was the ah beng style but it only got matches, nothing more. The second one was the rich looking style with the suit and expensive looking hotel background. I even got to go on a couple of dates.Two things happened in the dates. When they asked about hobbies and I told them about mine, they usually looked a little doubtful or sometimes a little turn-off-ish. The second thing is when I tell them my job, they realise that I am not exactly a rich person. They would either scold me for ""catfishing"", a term that I only learnt then or they just slowly ghost me after that. I told my friends of my experience and they asked me to just become rich. A little back story, I used to work in a really high paying job. The issue was that it was very stressful and the work never ends. I had to do a lot of OT, client meals and when I got home, my mind would still be thinking about work. I had no time for myself or anyone around me. I had to study or do prep work on weekends (no pay) just to ensure that my quality of work does not drop. I could somewhat handle the stress but the major problem was that I had no time for anyone around me, including myself. I did not see the point in earning so much money if I cannot spend time with people I care about.After I quit, things changed so much. My parents feel happier with me being around and I can help with them with their problems. I also have more time for myself - fitness and hobbies.When I told my friends why I am not going back to the high paying job, they said that the biggest problem with my approach is that I am trying to be someone I am not and that I am trying too hard. They said that I should be happy with my life first before I can get a gf. This made me quite frustrated because everything in my original profile was genuinely myself and I was already happy before I made the changes according to their suggestions. When I updated my profile to my photos that genuinely showed myself for who I am, I got zero matches. It is like back to square one again.By the way, the guy who was advising me to be happy with myself was actually suffering from depression. He managed to get the gf during his depression and somehow they worked it out. They eventually got married a couple of years later.Sidetrack, why not meet up through groups or social circles?This goes a little way back. As I mentioned, I am not that good looking. Throughout secondary school and JC, I have been rejected by girls when I proposed to them. Some of them turned me down nicely while some have blatantly said mean things to me. The worst insult that I ever received was ""I would rather die than be with you (and showed the sign of vomiting)"". Despite being rejected every time, I would still try to stay positive and move forward although it was hard. Uni experience was the same but everyone rejected nicely.As I mentioned, I used to volunteer. In general, the people there are usually more friendly and nicer. I was able to click with a lot of guys and girls. I even got very close to some of them to the point where they would share their very personal stories/issues with me. However, most of them were attached. Even if they were not attached, they would get attached to someone within the group or they would find someone else from their class. I tried to approach a few of them with whom I could click but all them rejected me. When I asked for a reason, they would give vague excuse like ""We are too different"" or ""I am not ready for relationship now"". The girl who said that she is not ready for relationship got into one the next week! I could not understand why I was not able to find someone despite being able to be close with people in the group. My friend explained this (roughly his words, not exact), ""I am going to tell the brutal truth. If we give numbers on a scale of 10, you would be 8 personality, 5 money, -100 looks. If I was a girl, and in the worst case scenario, I would still prefer someone who is 5 personality, 5 money 5 looks or in even worst worst case 5 personality, 8 money 1 looks. You are such a low bar to beat. Why would they pick you when they know they can definitely find someone who is definitely better than you.""I am still trying on dating apps. Now, there are dating apps that still has a little priority of substance over looks but when they see the photo or meet in real life, same thing happens.I feel that it is like a cycle. I am happy as I am but cannot find a romantic partner. People tell me to change. When I change and fail, they ask me to be happy and take of myself first. but i was fine in the first place?. Then, the process repeats. I have done this nonsense a couple of times with no difference. As much as I am happy with my status quo, I do want to have a family. I want a wife and kids just like my nephews and nieces. I have seen my friends finding someone and marrying that person within the span of 1-2 years. I always believed that my time will come despite the numerous failures. I have been trying to be positive for so darn long but recently, I have actually really finally started to doubt my prospects of finding someone.

At the end of the day, these people still earn NUS degrees and if they’re not happy with the nomenclature, it doesn’t matter how much they try to mansplain, we all know why.Yale-NUS has been an abomination from the start. No Ivy League university has ever tried to taint their reputation by selling out their brand in such a way. When they do so it is almost always set up as a dual-degree program where students are awarded two separate degrees from two separate institutions. Such as Harvard and Berklee, or Columbia and Science Po. As naff as dual degree programs are, they do not constitute a sell out because their cohorts are usually very small, and students would have gotten into either university. Yale-NUS students would not have gotten into Yale, as much as they would have you believe otherwise. It’s not as if their degrees are all suddenly being classified as unaccredited.

I also read some comments claiming that YNC is more selective.Yale applicants can apply to YNC at no extra cost/effort. Are you going to check that box if you lose absolutely nothing? Secondly, since Yale is need-blind, cross-admits will always choose Yale. If YNC were to admit every single student who would have gotten into Yale, I don't think they would have much of a cohort. In order to keep their yield high (I won't go into detail about why yield is of great importance to universities), they would have to choose students who are not Yale-worthy. If the majority of Yale applicants also apply to YNC, and these applicants would not be offered YNC because of yield concerns, suddenly you have a big-ass pool of applicants, most of whom would not be interested in YNC in the first place.I think YNC students/alum need to get off their high horse and stop pretending that they have an Ivy League pedigree because they don't.

99619,"I believe I am not the only one happy to see USP go. I empathise with the Yale-NUS kiddos but as an alumni of USP, I'm glad it'll no longer be around soon. Firstly, USP is not a scholarship programme (unlike NTU's), it is a scholar grooming programme where it wants to train thinkers. However, based on my experience in the college, it is just an elitist and exclusive place. The smartest people are not found here. The people found here are those who are book smart and overly confident in their intelligence. I would say the college has failed to make us true deep thinkers. The people I have interacted with are part of an echo chamber and well, may I say, have a lack of independent perspective. I was definitely disappointed when I realised that having intellectual conversations was challenging as having a differing opinion would make it seem like I have sinned and don't deserve a voice.Secondly, it is a blindly competitive place. Everyone competed based on how many CCAs one has. It was common for everyone to have 7-8 commitments to CCAs and committees. In fact, there was silent pride in being never available for a meeting because ""I have another meeting with xxx committee, yyy sports training"". It was tiring for me to keep up and when I gave up and just did what I really wanted, I was looked at as an odd one. Lastly, the programme does not value-add to employability. When I went for job interviews, I was never once asked about the USP cert. My manager later on mentioned that he thought it was just one of those fancy things I did in university. For a four-year programme, the amount of struggles I went through to complete it, I was quite disheartened to hear that. While I have met some good people, my USP experience was definitely disappointing and I hope that the New College will do a better job at enriching students.-#99619: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99619","['Like: 42 people', 'Haha: 9 people', 'Sad: 4 people']",5 comments,9 shares

I had work with a few colleagues in the sixties previously, and thankfully I was the most junior position and didn’t have to manage them. People in the beyond retirement age fall into vaguely 2 groups 1. The nice ones that are ready to retire, and will teach the young ones their wisdom 2. The spiteful ones that fear the young ones as they want their job and is afraid of you stealing their bowl, at this age, if they lose their current job, they don’t have much places that would hire them. The ones that will tell you they ate more salt than you ate rice. It sound like it will be tough to manage this subordinate. Based on the facts that you have provided 1. Currently 67 and in contractual role —> He/She applied for a promotion when he/she is 65, the retirement age. When mostpeople would be fearful if they would get let go. And contract role means he/she have the fear of not getting renewed.My advice,1. Leave. As your boss still appreciates your subordinate, and base on history it doesn’t sounds like he will support you. And this company sounds toxic already. If you leave during probation, just leave it out of your previous experience during your job hunt. Learn how to spot for toxicity in work place. Ask during interviews such as the most challenging part of the job, what caused the position to be empty. Is the company very desperate to get you on board? 2. If you want to stay, it’s not going to be easy. But below are somethings to try: Firstly, give up your pride as a manager and show him/her respect just for being your 40 years senior, your subordinate is afterall at least the age of your parents. Treat him/her like you would treat your parents. Also, don’t expect professionalism from him/her as of current, you took the position he/she wanted. There will be pettiness and jealousy involved. Second, have meals with him/her. This is the best time to talk and understand people.Third, (the hard one) bootlick him/her, words are cheap anyway. Tell him/her how awesome he/she is for staying in this company for so long. Can ask him/her for tips on working in this company in general, try not to go to assignment details.

A few months into the job, you may start to feel that your job scope is not what you expected. You are not being assigned tasks that you are passionate about.2. Your superior is not as helpful as you thought. Take gor gor's case as an example. My ex boss wanted me to plan an event/lesson for a group of 10 plus people. Sounds easy right? I had no experience in this (sadly no experience in camp planning). I scrambled to get help from the secretaries (my office support) but eventually, gor gor failed.

This is to tell you that you are stronger than you thought you are. Don't be like gor gor. Don't throw letter just yet. Stay on a while more. Learn more. Absorb more. Experience what the job really has to offer before you go. Consider throwing only when you feel like you cannot tahan anymore. A good benchmark to gor gor would be to tahan till your probation ends (or give yourself half a year), then think about whether this is really the right place for you. Stay strong, believe in yourself, and keep asking for help. Even people in other departments can help. Really. That was how gor gor managed to plan another event with another department's help. So to young grads, take it from me. You think you cannot tahan anymore, give yourself some time. Try your best. Ask for help. You never know, maybe you can push through and ace this job. Throw only when you think you cannot tolerate anymore. Happy working.*How to tell when you can tahan anymore? Your mental health suffers a huge blow. Gor gor will tell you more next time, that is if you want to.-#99614: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99614",['Like: 77 people'],0 Comments,14 shares
99613,"honestly, Architecture school doesn't teach me anything. 5 years of ''studying"", yet I really don't know what I have learnt. it's just a waste of time, energy, and sanity. honestly it's only for the piece of paper in the end. if not for that, I never learnt anything in school about fire codes, NEA codes for refuse output, or PUB codes for Drainage, which do matter in real working life. some more they placed so much emphasis on design module, which in real life, practicality takes so much precedence over design and much more integrated to just the fluff and nonsente talking during crit. crit also just usually an emotional abuse, dragging on for so long, sometimes to hear just ego war between the tutors. I learnt so much more in few months of working life than the 5 years I spent in NUS Archi.-#99613: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99613","['Like: 19 people', 'Care: 3 people']",7 comments,1 share
99610,"I am 4 months away from settling down with my boyfriend and lately I’ve been feeling uneasy. I have anxiety thinking about settling down and how this is going to be a new journey for me as I have never been so far away from my family cause after the wedding, I will be moving across the world as he needs to work there.Anyway, my boyfriend and I comes from 2 different culture and I come from a religious family. We have both been dating for quite a long time, almost a decade together and settling down end of this year.. To make my mother happy, my boyfriend will be joining my religion. This topic has always been very sensitive and important for the both of us since he does not come from a family who believed in God and I do. In the beginning of the first few months we started dating, I told him being with me is not going to be easy at all as I come from a religious family. He said he don’t mind and said to let the future decide for us and if he has to be part of us, he’ll be willing to be part of us.Today I found out that my boyfriend is not happy that he needs to pretend that he believes in God just so my mother could allow us to get married. He told me that he resents me for making him do this and I got really hurt when he said that. I have told him many times that he does not need to do this and he can find someone who accepts him for who he is but he kept saying he will do it and because he loves me, he wants to do it. It has been days now that I haven’t talk to him because my heart is confused. I love him so much but at the same time I do not want to go into a marriage with him resenting me for doing something he does not want to do and before everyone attacks me and calls me a mummy’s girl and how her opinion should not matter in our marriage - my mother is the only person I have left in this world and her health is bad too and I do not wish to do something or against what she believes in and make her more sick as I’ve lost my father a decade ago too. He did apologise for using the word resentment and admitted that it was a harsh word. I don’t know what to do anymore now. I don’t want to go into marriage life knowing that he has this feelings buried deep down in his heart.. I am at the verge of letting him go and be happy with someone else. I cannot afford to hurt both parties (him and my mother)… can someone advice me please  I’m tired of crying every now and then being in this dilemma….-#99610: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99610","['Like: 31 people', 'Care: 25 people', 'Haha: 5 people']",62 comments,13 shares

99600,"My partner has been keeping me in the dark about this lady colleague of his for nearly a year . Found out when she texted him bout buying coffee for him before work on workweeks and out if curiosity i ask why he didnt mention about the new colleagues existence given they have to work w each other closely. I dug deeper and found out he send her home sometimes (many of his colleagues drive btw) and even msg her off work to chitchat, go for after work group runs, lunches etc. He had also mentioned to his colleagues he found her cute and petite . He would mention every single one of his colleague who went lunch w him except for her while we were chatting about our day- lying by omission. A girl’s intuition is crazy. I recall once I had asked who adjusted my front seat jokingly and he asked if im thinking that he has been fetching girls home and if so stop acting “crazy”. Thought about it when im alone and it felt as though he is gaslighting me.  He felt that it is not necessary to mention it to me as i might misunderstood and since she will be rotating out of the department in 2 weeks time it is not necessary to let me know at all. And the phase will “pass”. I had expressed that if it is normal communications i will not bother and requested to look at his messages infront of him. He became defensive and raised his voice saying that i am intruding his privacy . After some fiddling with his phone (presumably deleting some text) he decided to show me the text and indeed they text on weekend about non work related stuff on a level i would consider crossing the line- spoke about boundaries a year ago . More recently i found out he has been exchanging socials and phone number with a online gaming female friend, chatting her up (non game related , personal work rant, sharing how shag his or her work is and totally flirty with the “hahahahaha why drinks no jio? Jio next time ah hehehehe” “ok i e-jio u next time when i drink so we can drink together hehehehehe”- i actually lost it as i cannot believe a grown man who is in his 30s will comms in such a manner and he had told me any friendship online will stay online). He had the intention to meet her up behind my back- this broke my heart. I recognized the notification pop up and asked who is he chatting up at 3 am while we are having drinks at our friends and he brushed me off. He usually chat with her when not beside him and he wud pretend to go mia/ fall asleep and all these while he was chatting with the girl. How is he keeping up with all these ? Wish to have honest input from the guys perspective. We are in talks to purchase a house and settle down soon- and his resolution for the matter is “i will not do it again” . I really wanted things to get sorted out quickly before i make that big decision and this has been bothering me.

99599,"Hi everyone, please listen to my story and kindly share an idea or suggestion. Thank you!I am 23 years old. Me and my boyfriend are together for 2 years+. We have a stable relationship, we hardly fight or argue. He really treats me the best and I have a strong relationship with his family as well. Nowadays, things have changed from my side. I m kind of interested in another guy at work. The moment I realised it by myself, I thought it’s just temporary and a little bit of flirting for awhile. I did feel bad for my bf as well. I was like why I m feeling like this. I know something is not right. The worst part is the other guy is in my head 24/7 even if I am spending time with my boyfriend. The reason I fell for the other guy is mostly because of his look (he is totally my type but my bf is not) and the chemistry between us. At work, I realised I enjoy talking to other guy and I can feel that he has mutual feelings for me too. We will talk to each other during break time or whenever available. I can see the sparkling in his eyes when we were talking too. I did try my best to stay away from him at work but couldn’t help usually. But so far, we never text or go out after work as he is also in a long distance relationship. We both know that we are attached. I really don’t know what to do. I really feel bad for my bf cos he really deserves better than me. My family is overseas and I am alone here. Sometimes I wonder, do I really love my boyfriend or i just want his/ his family’s accompany. If I decide to break up, i am gonna be alone, i will not have anyone to celebrate X’mas, CNY, birthday, etc which I really hate. To be honest, I have never been single for so long as I dated this boyfriend right after my previous relationship. I kind of feel like I should ask myself whether I want commitment or mot. I am not sure, I really don’t know what I want because this is a stable relationship and i kind of ruining it now. At the same time, I have no intention to break the other guy’s relationship as well. It has only been a week. Can you guys advise me? What do you all think from the situation? Do I really like the other guy or just enjoying the flirting feeling?Should I give myself a little more time and see whether they are just temporary feelings? Or, should I tell my boyfriend honestly, break up and focus on myself? Or what else should I do?

99598,"I am a Yale-NUS alum, and I am not too sad that YNC is gone because this place contains many awful memories, even traumatic ones for me. I cannot say these without anonymising myself because I am scared of the people on the internet. People on social media are painting an overly positive image of YNC and the community. Don’t get me wrong, I think there are lots of wonderful students, staff and faculty on campus, but there are definitely a few of them who have made other people’s lives extremely miserable. To respect privacy, I won’t list out what happened, but everyone can get a gist of it by browsing the news on YNC or Octant.The lack of transparency has been an issue for a long time and many people have been trying to push for greater transparency in communication/policy on campus. However, many times, whenever someone demand such, there will be a group of students who become protective of the college admin and show solidarity with them rather than their fellow peers who are trying to advocate for their benefit. While these students may come from a good position, their siding with the admin in reality weaken the demand for transparency (“see, only a vocal minority wants change”). Of course, the advocacy may not be the most well-phrased at times, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they are worthless (please these students are young adults who are still learning!). Admin are people, so are the students who demand transparency. Some of these admin defenders are now angry at the lack of transparency this time — but where were you when those of us needed your support in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020?I know when I say this, the comment section may be populated by comments like “imperfections so what - you perfect one meh?” “My experience is positive, why you draw hate?” No one is perfect, does that mean we cannot comment or criticise on everything at all in our lives? If you don’t want me to draw hate to your beloved college, stop yourself or your friends from creating bad memories for others.-#99598: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99598","['Like: 14 people', 'Sad: 4 people']",0 Comments,3 comments
99597,"Pardon my ignorance on this matter. I'm just looking at the surface of this and want to gain more understanding.I don't understand the outrage over the Yale-NUS matter. They have given sufficient notice such that those who enrolled in the following year will still be able to finish the course and graduate. From the comments that I've been seeing on social media, it gives me the impression that many feel that Yale-NUS is obligated to continue operating for their sake which seems ridiculous to me. I feel that it has fulfilled its obligations given how early it has announced the termination of the partnership, no one who has enrolled in it will be left hanging. The only argument that I can really see is those who might have failed and have to repeat a year, as such they are unable to complete the program before termination. If that's the case then how much time given will be appropriate? I'm not sure how many times you're allowed to fail before being dropped out of the course entirely so assuming it's 2 times then should they have given 6 years notice in advance then? I'm not sure if they would even have had confirmation on the decision to continue or terminate the partnership by then.So once again, I'm just trying to get someone to enlighten me and seek an understanding over the outrage of the entire issue.-#99597: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99597","['Like: 11 people', 'Wow: 1 person']",0 Comments,4 comments

99590,"Now is the season when fresh grads enter job market right? Come let gor gor here teach y'all a few Pippo(tips) to acclimatise to the working world:1. Have good relationships with the secretaries. Very important. They know where the stationery are, which catering companies to look at when you need to plan events. Which executive to look for in another department. Befriend the secretaries. Treat them like goddesses. Cos you never know, your next meeting session with their bosses rest in their hands. 2. Don't be alarmed when you are told to change your slide design. Accept the fact that each manager has a penchant for specific fonts for titles and subtitles. I will always remember my ex boss. Title don't 16, subtitle font 14, content font 12. Redo. Dumbfounded. Also, if you work in a big corporation, ask your colleagues if there are company slide templates. Viola. No need to search and do up fancy slides. Company presentations don't care about zooming in and out of slides. Fancy animations and all. Who has the time to care about how aesthetically appealing your background is. What's more important is the content. Clear and easy to understand please. 3. Learn the ropes as fast as you can. Keep asking since you are fresh. Once you are not fresh, and you still ask a lot of questions, they will start to question your question. In some situations however, if you are not taught something, it's still ok to ask. 4. In some companies, believe it or not, deeply rooted traditions still exist. Classic example: don't leave on the dot at 6pm even if you've finished your work. Dilly dally a bit more. Maybe around 15 to 30 mins then zao. You know the answer to this right. Don't need to explain much.5. Forgot to say this. Really really. Be good friends with your colleagues. Non managerial ones. They will be your source of support, comfort and office politics gossip. Who shouts at who before, who more approachable. Who is who where is where. How to connect printer to your laptop. How to submit request for stuff in the portal. Colleagues are super important when you don't want to appear like you know nothing. Why? If you keep asking your manager questions, he or she might think that you are not attentive when they are teaching you. But in the first place you are not taught that thing, or you didn't manage to jot it down in time. In this case, ask your colleagues. Confirm one of them know. 5 colleagues? Ask each of them in a rotation fashion. One question per week for each person if you need to. This way, they also won't think you are a nuisance. 6. Make full use of pantry if there is one. Gope the biscuits and snacks. You will need it for OT and when you skip lunch to rush the report. 7. Don't be gehkiang and be too outspoken. Newbies in the industry. Be quiet and observe. Speak up only when you have some grasp of how the department or industry works. Don't laokui (embarrassed) yourself in front of people especially in meetings. They tell you to speak up, but they want constructive and pertinent comments, not some elementary and basic queries that can be easily resolved offline or in emails. So, have questions? Ask your direct colleagues or staff. Not in meetings, not unless you know what the rest are doing. 8. Dept lunches. First few weeks you cannot escape. Tahan. Just tahan. I know you want to be alone. Watch your drama during lunch. But just tahan. Wait for a few weeks. Then slowly ease out of your lunch existence. Excuses can be busy with work, brought lunch already. Why cannot eat alone on first week? Remember connections? Yes. Build connections first. You need to know where that stapler is. Lunch breaks are important channels to pose queries. Make use of them. 9. They say don't anticipate. But I say do it. Always be a worry cat. Always think of what's to come next. Don't be too optimistic about stuff. Always be prepared to be rejected on the first draft. You can give it your all on the first try, but be prepared. Your all is not their all. Anticipate. Brace yourself for rejection. Strive on. 10. Lastly, after all the office survival tips, this might just be the most essential one. Know the food around. Know what the options are. Is there a cafe? Is there a bakery? Is there a kopitiam? Feeling splurgy? Order that latte. Feeling thrifty. Buy that 3 dollar cai png. Some places even have staff discount. On tight budget? Know where the convenience store is. Sometimes they have cheap offers. Know your food options. That's the least you can do to tahan through the rest of the afternoon until you knock off. Happy working.-#99590: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99590","['Like: 474 people', 'Love: 30 people']",33 comments,248 shares

99583,"@99554 I am in the same situation as you. My girlfriend throws wild accusations based on the most innocent things I say, and for whatever she /feels/ I might do in the future. Even when she dreams that I cheated on her, I am forced to placate her or else she takes it as a sign that I will indeed do it.Because of her going overseas for further studies and being 11 hours apart, we've been communicating via text for the past year. In situations of blame, it's no longer a case of he said she said because we have the chat history. When I point out the double standards in the stuff she's said, with evidence, she reacts in much the same way by throwing a tantrum and painting herself as the victim--the implication being that I must drop everything and nurse her wounded feelings. I feel utterly exhausted, and even though she says I am domineering, I am the one who is afraid of her, for fear of triggering her. I restarted therapy because of this in hopes of saving our five-year-old relationship, but my therapist said it's difficult to do so alone, which I agree. I am mindful that this is my biased side of the story. Surely I'm not faultless, though I don't know how much of the problem lies with me, and how much of it is on her. But one thing I am quite certain about is that she is has little sense of introspection and self-awareness. That's bad enough, but here's the kicker: she's currently pursuing a clinical psych masters to become a therapist herself. I regret having played a potentially decisive part in this by writing all her application essays and interview answers. Despite the clichés on her LinkedIn and resume, she is disdainful of the therapy modalities she's studying. Idk what I've gotten myself into... it's easy to say just break up but in reality it's not that straightforward.

Transferring to an Ivy League is even harder that being accepted as first year students…Please do not mention acceptance rate because the pool of students who apply to Yale are generally more competitive than Yale-NUS, and Yale receives far more applications a year.

We're in separate countries now, but over the years he has mildly stayed in touch by staying active on my social media. We starting texting recently again and he confessed that he still likes me. He keeps saying sweet things and how he misses me, wishes we were together. I'm having a hard time buying into it all though. How can he have a serious crush on me if our interactions at uni were so few? Would there be any ulterior motive for him to stay in touch online when we're far away? Does he mean it if he says we're compatible?

Everything is great so far but recently something about him is low-key bothering me. First is his lengthy past relationship (>5yrs) that makes me feel like I’m picking up someone else’s unwanted dump. Like he just gave most of her 20’s to a girl who eventually dumped him, I felt like he’s a leftover for me. Second is that he is nothing more than three (if u know what I mean). I consider myself above average in terms of height, look, physique and career. Honestly I’m not really into very physically-gifted guys but I mean I kinda expected something average at least, not so small. I know I sound like a bitch right now, that’s why I’m here for more solutions for my problems. I dun wanna make him feel I’m superficial, but those 2 things (his ex and small dick) really bother me.

99568,"Controversial. Please do not delete. Meant to encourage discourse.As a YNS alum, I'm actually glad about the decision to dissolve YNS because it has been from the start, a manifestation of Singaporean prestige-whoring to just a ridiculous degree. This whole experiment has never not been confusing. Why would Yale, a tier-one research institution whose affiliates have won multiple Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes, whose alumni have gone on to become American presidents and supreme court justices, be interested in lending their star-studded history in a project with a university a fraction of its stature? Were it not for the money that they stood to earn for the project, an Ivy League university like Yale would never in a million years consider such a collaboration, especially if it means its name has to be bastardized in such a way. They could just have easily called it anything else. Literally anything else. We have done it before. SUTD wasn't named MIT-NUS, and SMU wasn't named Wharton-NUS. Clearly something was fishy from the start. This didn't matter to my parents, to whom the word ""Yale"" was all they needed to force a decision onto me. This project occurred because Yale was willing to pimp out its brand for a good sum of money, and someone was willing to sanction any decision to make NUS seem a lot more world-class than it actually is. YNS students were never going to be good enough to be admitted to Yale. You can cite acceptance rates and whatever but the fact is that these numbers are inflated. It costs nothing to send an application to Yale-NUS as a Yale prospect, and Yale-NUS clearly wasn't going to jeopardize their yield by accepting students who were never going to come to Singapore anyway. If we simply removed all those Americans whose applications have indicated that they wished to apply to Yale-NUS, just out of convenience and not out of sincerity, the acceptance rate would probably turn out similar to NUS.What we end up getting is a bunch of holier-than-thou SJW-types who would have otherwise have no choice but to be in NUS, being banded together in an echo chamber where far-left ideas, on pain of excommunication, are never held to the acid test of textbook Singaporean pragmatism.Wasn't it a Yale-NUS alumni who got themselves into trouble after releasing a viral video that clearly demonstrates the kind of ""frontier justice"" that promotes aggressive activism? I actually stand by them in principle. But the idea that the only way to change a society is by being angry is childish. If we could change the prejudices of the older generation overnight, LKY wouldn't have had to take his entire life to fail to fix the third-world mentality in Singapore. The decision to wind up the college is good. Liberalism is mostly good. Echo-chambers are always bad.-#99568: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99568","['Like: 57 people', 'Haha: 18 people']",21 comments,10 shares

Secondly, what are you trying to accomplish? To get your friends to hate me? Doesn’t help that her friends are extremely judgemental.

99537,"TLDR; I have doubts whether to continue this relationship or not. Should I give up? What advice would you give to a friend in such a situation? I got divorced about 2 years ago and currently I’m in a relationship with this guy who’s in his 30s who is also a divorcee with a kid. Some information about this guy. He’s decent looking. He seemingly has mostly the right value and principles in life. Character wise he’s okay, but two things that I can’t stand. He’s hot tempered and I come to realise kind of wishy washy. He is not exactly doing very well. I earn more than he does. He’s in debt and he’s has difficulty scraping through every month. We practically go dutch (I pay more sometimes) on dates because of this. He has his own space and he is renting out to his ex gf and sister (Malaysian zzz) and the rent helps with his finances (still barely scraping if you ask me). Because of this, I have never been unable to go up to his place openly. For the duration of time we are together, we are always quarrelling about this matter. 1. At first he was suppose to get the gf and the sister to move out. But not done. On the account that the rental does help with his finances. I relented. 2. I am only asking for a simple request. I should not be barred from gg up to his place isn’t it? Or am i expecting too much. But it takes so long to get one thing settled.3. He gives the reason that he’s looking for the right time to talk to the ex-gf. He is afraid the ex will be unhappy and decide to look for a better place to stay (loss of rental), or worse case scenario if she’s not over him, she might kill herself. 4. Despite breaking up already for more than a year. Yes wtf - is he thinking too much? Or is this an excuse idk. Freaking foreign girls seriously. We are not looking to get married (becos really that’s overrated, if you ask me). But I find myself feeling stupid and sore to be compromising on this matter. I get nothing out of this, and it is not as if the a portion of the rental goes to me. I’m bitter about it. I dk whether to give up on him. Everytime I try to, he will crawl his way back and I’ll end up relenting. I find myself becoming more bitter about the relationship but idk how to let him go. It’s probably hurting my ego to be with such a person but yet, losing him on such grounds hurts my ego too. I mean, I can be happily single or find a better person out there. But really… people have asked what’s holding me back from giving him up. 1. He’s keeps me company.. a decent company, I guess. 2. The sex; not too bad. We have the same drive and it keeps the relationship gg I guess. But I’m beginning to doubt if we can go on for long term. We can’t communicate because whenever we touch on sensitive topics as above he shuts off. Yes, he does crawl back everytime we quarrel, looking for me, eventually but it feels like this relationship really isn’t gg anywhere. Because everytime I think of the problem he brings on the table, I feel shortchanged. I no longer knows if I truly want him back because of I love him or if it’s really because I don’t wanna be single. Yet I find it very tough to continue working on the relationship with him as it’s just tiring to keep quarrelling about the same issues over and over again. I don’t understand why I even need to ask for basic decency about the ex-gf matter.

99422,"Hi I’m the OP from #98895. Having met more than 10 different guys within the span of half a year, I just wanted to share some observations that hopefully may be helpful for you if you’re using apps!#1 - never trust a guy blindly until he proves it with his actions over time. If a guy tells you that he is looking for something serious, give him the benefit of doubt but don’t fully trust him until he proves it. I’ve mistrusted the wrong guy who told me that he wanted to settle down but turned out he was just looking for FWBs. And his game was damn solid, the way he talked to me, treated me and planned our dates was NOT the typical trajectory of how a FWB relationship would usually look like. He would even spend hours talking to me on the phone everyday. In the end, he put out after I revealed that i was not that keen to proceed too fast physically. #2 - Don’t ever dupe yourself into thinking a guy is interested in you if he texts you everyday BUT doesn’t proactively initiate to meet you. Most likely, this guy is just looking for a text buddy ???? Sometimes, us girls will try to cling on to the hope that if he carries on the convo, or even double / triple texts us when we didn’t reply instantly, he is interested. sure… but I think most importantly if he doesn’t actively tries to meet you, most likely he isn’t THAT interested.From my experience, I have been texting this guy almost everyday for about 6+ months. During this 6+ months, I’ve dated others, some consisting of only 1-2 dates and two of them I’ve dated 1-3 months. Funny thing is, this 6months + guy was so-called the longest standing “date” but we have only met once ???? Ever since that one time we met up, he did drop hints on meeting again but never proactively plan a date. And a few times when I did not reply him, he will double text me again.In the end, I decided to ghost for good cos’ I was too lazy to reply and I wasn’t interested enough either. But yes based on my experience, it’s quite absurd to me that someone can bother to keep tabs and text another person consistently for 6 entire months without even wanting to meet the person!!! But I guess the world is full of strange people with strange motivations. #3 When they say that dating apps allow you to expand your social network and meet people you don’t usually encounter in your daily life, it’s true.. in a good or bad way depending on your luck. I know I’ll get roasted (especially by guys) on the point below but i am sure most girls will agree with meWhat I meant in my previous post about lowering my standards was because 1) honestly speaking, the amount of good looking girls on the apps way surpassed the amount of good looking Sporean guys who dress well on the app. I honestly don’t think I’m very picky already in terms of choosing someone based on his looks but the ”quality” of Sporean guys on the apps is really quite appalling. To the extent that out of 10 profiles, only 1 is average looking with a 5/10 rating looks wise. Sometimes it’s 0 out of 10 profiles who are average looking lol. 2) I think I’ve a bad habit of always trying to convince myself that maybe the person will look better in real life as compared to photo only to feel disappointed most of the time. I think part of me is just tired of restarting the whole process so I would rather meet this person I’ve been talking to for x number of weeks first and reevaluate from there.so my naïveté & the fact that there’re so few decent looking guys on the apps prompted me to give guys I won’t even give a second glance, a chance. And I think most girls might be able to relate to this.-#99422: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99422","['Like: 12 people', 'Wow: 2 people']",10 comments,7 shares
99421,"In Nus, I struggled significantly with my mental health due to a couple of episodes where my physical health was compromised. I fainted a couple of times and these events led to severe panic attacks. This harrowing experience ,that lasted for four years, taught me key and valuable lessons that I hope others can relate to and maybe adopt for themselves. Caveat: What I write is genuinely what I went through and made sense for me but the lifestyles and personalities of everyone else is varied and so if it does not make sense for you, there is no need to adopt it. 1) Learn to find what exactly you enjoy about being in university rather than only seeing it as a burden to complete or seeing it as a perpetual rat race. University is not only a time to excel grades-wise, but it is also a time to build yourself and your personality. Constantly being worried about grades, beauty, relationships and money will only lead to you being depressed and unhappy, while suppressing your genuine inner personality. It is when you shift your mindset to making yourself happy and finding ( people, events, places, activities) to discover who you are, will you have the confidence and develop that bright spark to achieve the rest. I find that 90 percent of the time, it was the reverse where people were drowning in insecurities and compromising what they would genuinely want, in order to achieve what they think they must have. ( ie. Everyone is doing A and so i must do A, even if I dont actually want to or feel ready for it )  Sure at the end of four years, you may have got that first class honours or you may have achieved a certain financial target. Question is: Do you feel proud or just relieved that you made it? If its relief, then you still struggle with an insecurity and base your self-worth on this. It will come to a point where you have made so many compromises to achieve what you think you must have, that you end up being bitter and possibly shallow. For me, because I was impacted by my circumstances, I really had to create environments that would make me happy and help me to feel safe. This led to me joining everything under the sun - from pilates, to dance, astronomy, social dancing and going out of my way to talk to exchange students. I decided to explore my interests, in spite of my grades taking a downward spiral and my self-confidence deteriorating. I found that I actually discovered so much more and it led to me actually figuring out what i wanted to major in and eventually,I turned my grades around so by the time i hit my honours year, I scored straight A's. This is not to say Im less bitter or shallow, its just that I was more at peace with my journey than others who seemed to despise the journey and associated their time in uni as highly stressful and competitive.2) Your intelligence is not tied to your grades. Read this again. okay and again. Read this as many times as you need so you can internalise it. okay now let's try another one: You can be intelligent even if you have poor grades. Having entered university from the JC, and having been in a competitive cca for more than 10 years - I firmly believed the only good and valuable thing about me was my grades. Then uni hit and that went down the drain. Then I realised, there were people I met who understood different things about life that honestly made them intelligent. One knew and deeply understood people, so she knew how to navigate relationships. Emotional intelligence is so important and when you go out into the working world, you will realise that it is this trait combined with confidence that helps you to thrive. There was another who was entrepreneurial and knew where to find the lobang and how to create the lobang. May not have been perfect with the theories or the essays but she could spot opportunities and knew how to cash them. One was a perfectly gifted orator with many unconventional ideas - led to her writing a CV that got her into a top consulting firm despite average grades. There are so many other forms of intelligence and if you can train yourself to start looking away from grades as the almighty one, you may realise that the world is much bigger and has more depth. This is not to say grades are not important- it is but not to the extent we as a society has priced them to be. Overall, I hope this helps and I wish all of you the best in the paths you take and lifes you choose to lead-#99421: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99421","['Like: 2 people', 'Sad: 1 person']",0 Comments,1 share

I have thought about finding her a better home but the guilt just overwhelms me even though I know this will be better for both the dog and myself. I am not willing to give her up to a rehoming center or a kennel. I will only give her up if I can find her a better home, which is not easy. What should I do?-#99410: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99410","['Like: 2 people', 'Haha: 1 person']",0 Comments,3 comments
99406,"My bf has a close female friend - that friend that guys would tell their gf that there’s nothing to worry about. They’re good friends, not bffs but he often shares important news and updates with her and regularly catch up with her. She knows his family and extended family while I have yet to meet any despite being in a relationship with him for a year. Im not particularly concerned about their relationship but my friends kept telling me that something is very off about this friendship dynamic. My bf had previously confessed to his female friend 3 times over 4 years but she turned him down and they remained as good friends. She’s not in any of his cliques so they often hung out 1-on-1. Each time they went out to eat with one another (~every 2-3 months) he would drive up to fetch her and bring her to a high end restaurants, and the bill often goes up to $300++, of which he pays for it 8/10 times. Their meetups often lasted between 4-6 hours everytime, which others say its relatively long for a catch up session as it could go slightly past midnight occasionally. However, he always make sure to keep me updated when he meet with him. On the other hand, he would bring me to eat in hawker centres, fast food places or purchase ready made food from 7-11/donki, not that I complain because they’re delicious! But we never had a fancy date due to budget constraints and i always paid for my share of the meals too or even pay for both of our meals. He would also ask for me to pay for it at the end of the day. My friends are saying that treating a friend, particularly someone he used to like (or still likes) for expensive meals while not doing the same for me, his gf, is a red flag and i should have a talk with him about it. As he was very open about his interactions with his female friend to me and is willing to disclose such information, i generally do not feel jealous or be suspicious about it. Furthermore, i feel that meeting his family would be something i would do in the future, not at present as we are both busy with school and work. But is this issue something i be concerned with and clarify with him about?-#99406: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99406",['Like: 3 people'],5 comments,3 shares
99405,"Has anyone ever tried to feedback to NUS on unfair treatment by internship supervisor? For context, I'm on IA (under FOE) this semester and the IA mod is pass/fail. Despite this being my first internship, I'm putting in my best effort to learn and contribute as much as I can, sometimes even OT-ing at night/weekends to get my tasks done. As a startup intern, there're many things to be done and sometimes, I'd want to do them as efficiently as possible. Here comes the problem. Although I want to do things quickly, I lack experience in finding the fastest possible way (probably because it's my first time doing the task). The moment my supervisor sees this, ___ immediately jump to the conclusion that I'm being lazy. I have tried explaining but there's no use at all. Apart from this, ___ has also threw (very) personal attacks and (sometimes) vulgarities at me. As much as I know that I shouldn't be bothered by these, it still hurts me deeply as I go out of my way to complete the tasks, only to receive hurtful remarks like this. As you probably inferred, there are many more things that sadden and hurt me, but I won't go into detail because it'll make this post too depressing. I am more than willing to continue going out of my way for the company, as long as this situation gets better (maybe someone might lecture me for being naive and stupid, but I really do not mind contributing more to the company). But for now, I can't help but have a mental breakdown after work everyday. Should I reveal some fragments of my grievances to the school during compulsory consultation? What should I do? Prof Ben and seniors, please advise. Thank you very much for reading till the end of this post.-#99405: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99405",['No Reactions'],0 Comments,0 Shares
99396,"I am 25 and I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD a few years ago. In the beginning, it was very distressing and crippling to the extent where it would interfere with my daily activities and life. One time I had a major anxiety attack and refused to leave a public toilet for 4 hours, which led to my parents freaking out bc I was uncontactable and we had a family dinner that evening. It then got better when I started uni in September that same year. The first two years were a challenge bc I had a heavy workload and was constantly feeling anxious and on edge all the time. Little things would trigger me easily. Things got better during the third year onwards when my psychiatrist started prescribing me a medication that worked for me and my condition. However, my anxiety/OCD did not fully go away. It would still come and go whenever it pleases. However, I have to say that during the last few years, my condition has improved a lot. It would occasionally come and when it does, it is serious, but not as serious as the toilet incident.Anyway, my gf and I went to the arcade one night. We were having such a good time, until the last 5 mins of our visit there when we were counting our tickets. She wanted to do something which I didn’t want her to bc I knew it wouldn’t work. She went ahead and did it anyway, which really triggered my anxiety and my OCD started to flare up. In the moment, I said to her “I told you alr right, you so stupid.” I knew I fucked up right after bc she really hates it when people call her stupid/dumb and I could also tell from her facial expression. She also has a very bad temper. We didn’t talk at all during the whole ride back from suntec to Yishun. I was depressed again.Even though my gf knows about my mental condition and we’ve been together for a year, I don’t think she fully understands what I’m going through and the extent of my condition (which I don’t blame her at all bc even my parents don’t get it and I’ve been told many times by people and my ex-counselor that these are all “irrational” thoughts). I am aware of that and sometimes I feel like I’m just going fucking crazy and start hating myself.Does anyone have any advice for me? -#99396: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99396","['Like: 9 people', 'Care: 5 people', 'Sad: 4 people']",21 comments,2 shares
99395,"TLDR; I recently found out my boyfriend of 3 years paid for sex (prostitutes) when he was younger and question his values because he introduced the world of prostitutes to his married brother.This is gonna be REALLY long, but I'm seeking for advice on my situation. I have a boyfriend of 3 years and he really loves me (vice versa). He will always put my needs before him and is faithful during the span of our relationship. However, I recently found out about something he did when he was in his early 20s that makes me question him/our relationship. To elaborate on what happened, he was young and single (and kind of desperate) back then, so he paid for prostitutes to satisfy his needs. I understand from his standpoint because they have their needs, and his only outlet then was paying for sex. I guess it's the same idea as people having one-night stand and the only difference is he paid for it so I'm actually not judging his promiscuous lifestyle back then since it was before he met me. But what made me angry/sad was his selfishness of not letting me know when we first started this relationship, and instead only telling me 3 years down our relationship (read along the lines of potentially contracting STDs). Yes, he got himself checked and he is clear (but what if the hypothetical 0.000001% chance he was not?). I personally feel that he is really selfish for not letting me know and he could at least let me know out of respect at the start of our relationship. Whether or not I want to commit to this relationship even after he disclose his past is my choice. What he told me was, he really cherishes our relationship, and he is scared that I will leave him after he tells me the truth (especially since it's the beginning of the relationship and stakes were still pretty low). I thought it was really selfish of him to do that. Because it's really a fact right now that I'm 3 years invested in this relationship and the stakes are so high that I can't just walk away. I felt really angry because I FELT (personal opinion) he got exactly what he wanted and I'm really playing in the palm of his hand. Disclaimer, he is faithful to me and treats me really well now. He isn't cheating on me or visited prostitutes during our relationship. But I can't help but feel anger towards his selfishness.I know what some of you might say, let the past be the past. He isn't obliged to tell me, and a lot of guys actually have similar past but they don't usually tell their other half to ""protect"" the relationship, etc. So yes, I acknowledge that and I really appreciate him telling me the truth. But there's more to this story than the above, which made me question him/his values.Timeline: this was also during his early 20s when he was living his best life as described above. He has a brother who is very much older than him. Back then his bro was married to his wife (not sure how long they were married for, but they were together for at least 10 years). I am also not sure how the marriage spiralled, but there was once my bf and his bro went for a drink and his bro told him about how there might be something going on between him and his MARRIED female colleague. At that point in time when his bro told him, the cheating hasn't happened YET. But what really irked me was my bf's suggestion/advice to his bro. He told his bro something along the lines of ""if you're just itching, I have contacts for prostitutes. But DON'T ever start a relationship with your female colleague. She is married ffs"" (paraphrased). When he told me this, my mind was blown because he clearly thinks it's less of an issue when it comes to physical cheating vs emotional cheating (disclaimer: I get it that some people think physical and emotional cheating are different things altogether, but what I'm trying to drive at is that I PERSONALLY am against both physical and emotional cheating, hence the idea is more about my bf and my personal values are not aligned). He said in his defense, he currently thinks both physical and emotional cheating are equally bad. He was young and pretty drunk and he is aware now that his values were questionable back then. Anyway, his bro eventually cheated physically AND emotionally and the marriage broke apart. After introducing his bro to the world of prostitutes, his bro engage in such services frequently (after he and his wife divorced). Let's talk about temptation. Recently my bf and his bro were casually eating (and drinking) along the streets of Geylang, and his bro was itching. So he told my bf he's gonna find prostitute, and HAD THE AUDACITY to ask my bf if he wanted to go as well. Mind you, his bro is 100% aware of my existence and we literally hangout together (as a trio). I'm talking about going out for meals and even travelling together as a trio. More than anything, I really lost ALL respect for his bro and I simply do not want to have any interaction with him EVER. In my bf's defense (once again), he didn't agree to it/didn't cheat on me and was waiting outside the chicken coop instead. He also said his bro could be just joking when he asked him if he wanted to come along. Like if my bf were to agree to it, his bro would most probably question him if he was serious. But hey, this is a mystery we'll never unravel. My bf is all about giving his bro the benefit of doubt, but they are family after all, so you will surely side family no? Doesn't matter to me, I simply lost all respect for his bro as a person because he's got really questionable morals (to me, not my bf). It really got me thinking about how it's a vicious cycle of temptations. Back then he introduced his bro to the world of prostitutes and unknowingly enabled his ""physical"" cheating ways. Right now it circled back such that his bro could possibly and easily enable my bf to cheat, so my bf could possibly be more prone to cheating. I know I sound really paranoid and pathetic, but I really can't help thinking in this 0 to 100 way because my logical state of mind is failing me. I don't know how/what to think about this and I really need some advice/enlightenment (his selfishness, potential temptations, etc.) I'm also finding it really difficult to reconcile with the whole physical vs emotional cheating theory he mentioned back then. Although he regretted what he said, it still makes me question his innate values. It just kind of planted this seed of insecurity/doubt in me such that in the future if he ever itches, he can simply go about his philandering ways? Although he isn't cheating on me today, but what if he cheats on me a year later? 3 years later? 10 years later? The stakes are only going to get higher as time goes by. He says he won't cheat, but all guys say the same bs. I'm just thinking in the future, will I ever look back at my stupid self today for seeing the red flags but not acting on it by leaving this relationship just because he hasn't cheated YET. P.s. appreciate if you can give me some tips to deal with his bro in case we are ever forced to be in the same setting because I'm not going into the whole ""if your bro and I drop into the sea, who will you save first"" rabbit hole. Seriously, I wear my heart on my sleeve and I simply can't hide my disdain towards people I have no respect for.-#99395: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99395","['Like: 13 people', 'Haha: 5 people', 'Sad: 3 people']",47 comments,8 shares
99392,"Hi. How do you deal with elderly parents who constantly go to the clinic? Or even A&E/call an ambulance when it is NOT an emergency? For example, my mom felt dizzy one day and she thought she was going to die. Called the ambulance, went to the hospital etc, and it turned out to be nothing. This was on a weekday night at midnight. The worse was when she went to A&E in the morning for constipation. It turned out to be nothing. She said she was worried it will be appendicitis cause her friend went for appendix surgery a few months back. She said she was also worried about it being colon cancer since it is difficult to detect colon cancer. She told me she is glad they did xrays and blood tests for her. she mentioned previously she had constipation and went to a clinic, they just gave her meds without any xrays and blood tests. I was speechless. She was not even in pain. She also wanted to see a specialist. On the SAME DAY in the afternoon, she felt nauseous and decided to alert all of us (family members) again. Then she went uncontactable. We were worried and rushed down home & she went to A&E again. Of course it turned out to be nothing. Visit A&E twice in less than a span of 8 hours!!This happens at least once a month. Sometimes it’s bad sometimes it’s not too bad but it still gives me anxiety. I am at my wits’ end. Everytime she does this some of us has to drop everything we are doing (like work!!) and rush to her immediately.I’m afraid if I ignore her, it might really be a health emergency. But if I don’t, it’s like answering to the boy who cried wolf everytime?I am also extremely angry at her for using this selfish method to seek attention(I’m assuming). We visit her more than once a week, and i have 2 other siblings who live with her too. My dad is working but is also home most of the time. She also constantly asks me/my siblings questions about her medications when we are not even doctors. I have informed her to ask her own doctor but she just likes to ask us… she will sometimes google random medications and even ask me if she can take it??? She also went to a specialist before to conduct tests and to ask why her feet swells in the morning when she wakes up. She said she was scared it might be sth serious.. even though i have reassured her that it is normal. Even after the specialist confirmed that it is normal for someone her age, she did not believe him and continued worrying about it (and also keep asking me about it to this day from time to time)!!Oh that’s just the tip of the iceberg.. pls help…..-#99392: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99392","['Like: 4 people', 'Wow: 1 person', 'Care: 1 person']",20 comments,2 shares
99390,"Have you ever have such encounter. Sometimes I thought I didnt know how to love, but then perhaps I was wrong. I know this guy for 2 years. He never say he wanted me. But yet at certain time, we can be close, we can behave as a couple, we held hand, we kissed. So that's us. I know that was wrong, everytime I wanted sometimes from him like how a normal couple would expect, like going out on special occasion, holding hand, even if we are in public. Able to cuddle in bed. He give me a ""No"" feeling. He never say he wanted me, neither does he say he didnt want a relationship. It's torturing to me falling and picking up myself each and everytime. There was a special day I wanted him to celebrate with him, we were talking some day back and I was hinting to ask him out. Eventually the conversation die off and nothing happen. I should have asked him, I know ppl would have say so, but I started to feel his unwillingness for the occasion, when eventually I was happy (just because of his presence), but I just felt, he was just appearing to be happy with me so as not to disappoint me. So on this special occasion, I kept myself occupied, but when I was left alone, I was actually crying. I was actually crying when I was walking. I told myself that he can forget about this day, which I cherish so much and wanted his presence, does it not make me realized how insignificant I am to him(ya, I know I am not important). I know I have to move on. I told myself so. But today (jus a few days later). I missed him, I seem to forget all the sorrow I had gone through, I want to be back with him. I kind of told myself I had pack up the feeling to move on, and remain as friend. But I know eventually, I will bump myself on the wall again, and felt the cycle all over again. He wouldnt always say No to me, but I felt he was just trying to keep me happy because I care for him sincerely. I really do. Now, it seem that I was a  burden to him, and make me wanne leave this ""relationship"" when yes, ultimately I wanted to care. I wanted the reciprocal feeling, I know I cant, I pick my broken pieces by myself. And now I got the feeling of being a burden.

99388,I recently met this girl online. We have chatted over the app and also talked over the phone. She is pretty eager to meet but I have been pushing back for various reasons. The conversation just flows between us. I also think she is very good looking. However she only wants a drama free sexual relationship no strings attached. She said we can do this medium or long term whenever we both have time. Her only caveat is her drive is high and I must be able to do multiple times in one night. I think it’s a bit of a waste though given our chemistry. I suppose it would be foolish of me to hope that this can be something more?-#99388: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99388,"['Like: 12 people', 'Haha: 7 people']",24 comments,1 share
99389,"I met this girl, a year older than me, online from an app about a few months in mid-May, we texted everyday and two weeks later, she wanted to meet me physically to which I agreed. But a few hours before she our meet up, she told me that she went to meet another guy from the same app and hung out for a few hours. Initially, I was a little puzzled as to why she told me that. So after talking for a couple of hours, she told me that she liked me and to be honest, I’m not sure if that’s a red flag because we only known each other for a couple of weeks and I barely know her and she just straight up tells me she like me like ‘ok….’, of course I didn’t really know how to respond and simply said, ‘I am interest in knowing you more’So she shared freely with me her past that she did a lot of things, physical intimacy with her ex (She knew him for about 2 and a half years) and they broke up because he kept calling her derogatory names, him being super clingy and would blame her for everything that went wrong in their relationship. On the days we hang out, many times she would mention about what she did with her ex and the things he liked and what not (Again, I was a little puzzle and confused as to why she kept sharing about her ex every time). She would also make those ‘uwu/anime girl sounds’ which to me sounded quite annoying and irritating. She would get angry at me over the small things like just changing the time we meet or when I’m just like for 5 minutes, she would blame and criticize me that ‘I am someone who cannot keep track of time’ or another time where I was visiting my grandmother, I told her that I can’t attend this event with her, and she just flared up. It was just the small things she would hold grudges and resentment. For our conversations everyday, she would talk to me about her work (I’m still studying in my 2nd year so I can’t really relate much to it) and rant about her bad her work is and stuff, and I offered some of my suggestions and opinions that could possibly help her but what I got was more ranting. Initially I was okay to hear about her rant for about a week or so but to hear about someone ranting every single day for the past two months, I felt quite uncomfortable about it. I would rather talk about something much more interesting and fruitful instead of hearing all these negative stuffs everyday just felt mentally draining from schoolwork. I really tried my best to help and support her during such periods but it just seems tougher by the week.For a few moments, she would talk about our future together (Keep in mind that we only knew each other for two months) So one day, I decided to let her know that we should stay friends as I didn’t want to hype up this whole thing only to let her down eventually or keep any expectation that she had going up. Furthermore, I personally don’t think I’m ready for a relationship (which probably what she was expecting) and I want to enjoy my singlehood for the time being. At first, she was upset and just gave me a cold shoulder reaction. Thinking back, I thought her being a year older than me, would garner somewhat a more mature response or understand the situation a lot better. Eventually, after letting her know my stand that we can remain friends but going further would be up to anyone’s guess. Our conversation everyday gradually became to a stop where she would make up small talk like ‘Oh look at what I’m eating’, ‘Look at this cat so funny haha’ everyday, personally I’m not really good at small talk so I could only respond so much like ‘LOL HAHAH LMAO’ and she just complained to my close friend that I’m ghosting her when the truth was that I’m not that interested in her but rather stick as friends and it feels like she’s pushing in the boundaries beyond my comfort zone. Our conversation went like this:Her: how are you doing?Me: Doing alright having a ton of school work and projects to submit, wbu?Her: Nvrm I don’t care alreadyThe whole thing just felt bizarre and weird and I tried to ask her what’s wrong but she didn’t really say much. Basically, she just felt like I’m ghosting her and ignoring her when the truth is that I’m just simply not that interested in her and just want to live my life. I suppose different wavelengths, different frequency.But the thing I have on my mind right now is that at times I feel like she’s having traits of her ex and just straight up blaming me for the smallest things and hold some form of grudge to use it against me which I felt was abit toxic, and that she has quite a lot of unsolved emotional baggage on her end and that she’s just dumping onto me, am I in the wrong to tell her my boundaries?-#99389: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99389","['Like: 9 people', 'Haha: 2 people', 'Care: 1 person']",16 comments,3 shares

I am here to ask if people think I should listen to her?She wants me to lose 5kg as I have a muffin top.She wants me to go for a hair transplant as I am receding at the temples. Full head of hair otherwise though. She said it is embarrassing for her to be seen dating someone who might go bald one day.She wants me to go for plastic surgery to shave the bone around my jaw as she said my face is too wide. I actually went to see a surgeon who told me she thinks it is a bad idea as usually this sort of drastic surgery is more for people who have been in serious accidents.Overall I will say I am a slightly above average looking guy. I am not particularly good looking but there are girls who are drawn to my looks. My girlfriend on the other hand can easily be a model. She is super vain and is the sort who can spend four hours just picking the perfect lipstick colour.

99385,"This is a question for Prof Ben and also for everyone else with experience in relationships, especially on the financial side of things. Shoutout to Prof Ben as I believe you once mentioned that you leave all your money for your wife to handle?To give some context, I have been with my gf for 2 years. She is from a quite well-off family the kind who owns around 10 properties. My family is not well off, likely bottom ten percent of Singapore if you consider net worth. Her salary is about 3k a month and mine is around 15k a month. I am one year older than her.My gf said some things to me last week which I found quite shocking.Firstly she said she feels like dating a secondary school kid when she is dating me. She said because I often buy basic jewellery and food for her, or bubble tea which is a childish joke. She mentioned her friends' boyfriends buy expensive watches and bags for them and even her parents buy expensive makeup and perfumes for her, so she expect her boyfriend to at least be able to match what her parents can give her because that is her standard. She said instead of giving her small gifts or writing cards to her, she rather I stop being a kid, so immature, grow up and buy her expensive things. She said this is how adults date. Her friends who chose bfs or eventually husbands based on how much money they can give them, are all now very happy.Secondly, she said she is upset at me for being so poor and earning so little money. I was very surprised to hear this come out of her mouth given that I make five times her salary. She said she feels sorry for me that I cannot spend more money and feel like paying for me so often. But I know she say say only, our expenditure when dating is almost entirely paid for by me. She swipes parents' credit card even when shopping for herself. She said I am very incapable and I should reflect on why my salary is so low. She said she is unsure if she can continue dating such a low income guy like me.I countered by saying actually on 3k a month, based on her own earning abilities, her lifestyle should be on the more budget end. By saying all these, it means she wants to use my income to upgrade her own lifestyle. I asked her to clarify if this is fact. She then said that is not true, my lifestyle is too budget for her and I need to up my game to match her standard. I was so confused so I said ok long story short, you just want me to buy you expensive bags and watches is it? She said yes. Then I said did you just contradict yourself then? She said well it is ugly to say it out directly, she is giving me a chance to be a real man and gentleman and take the hint and spend on her without saying it and making everything sound not nice.She then went on to say she is unhappy that I help out my parents financially etc etc and that I cannot give her a sense of security unlike her friends' boyfriends who spend 100 percent of their salary on their gfs and then borrow or take money from their parents to cover their own living costs. I countered by saying isn't that leeching off the older generation? She scoffed and said that is called the power of a family, the power of a community. I know nothing about all these because I am from humble backgrounds and this is how the real world works.I must admit I was super shocked to hear all of these. The only hint I ever got before this that she thinks this way was that she is always telling me about her friends' successful golddigging attempts and how happy they are.Do you people think any of her points are valid?It sounds so messed up to me but she said everything so convincingly and matter of factly that I am not so sure anymore.-#99385: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99385","['Sad: 11 people', 'Haha: 8 people', 'Like: 5 people']",43 comments,14 shares

99364,"[In serious need of advice]Before anyone judge me too harshly, I just want to put it out there - also for those who are in the workforce and unfamiliar with the university landscape now. University is stressful and for many who have a part-time job to fund our high university fees and are unable to cope with the workload, ghostwriters have been the solution. There are so many ghostwriters on platforms such as Carousell. I found a highly-rated ghostwriter business who is a Singapore Registered Business. Hired their service for a project and it was satisfactory. Hence, as I was stressed out juggling with the workload from many modules, I decided to hire their service once more for my online exams. In the end, the online exams were outsourced and badly done - answers were found on google and not paraphrased at all. I failed the exams and were marked for plaglarism with disclpinary consequences. As much as I am at fault for hiring someone to take my online exam for me, I feel that the business should take responsibility too. I am writing to seek your opinions and thoughts on whether I should publish a full review publicly online (with screenshots and details) to prevent other students from potentially falling for the same thing with them. Currently, the business has a perfectly clean record on Carousell.

99362,"I am from SoC, going into Year 3 this semester, and seriously considering withdrawing from my course and going into a private school.For some background, I am a PR, did quite well for my high school exam, and had no interest in any course when I was applying to NUS, so with heavy family influence and based on my score, I chose BZA.Ever since the start of Year 2, I realized I have 0 interest in my major, so every semester became extreme torture especially group projects where you cannot afford to not put in the effort because of your teammates.I consider myself a creative person – I like painting, writing, playing music, just any of the creative fields in general. And I do think I have some inherent talent in it, I scored distinctions in my O-Level Higher Art as well as my IBDP High Level Art, topped the cohort. Programming is actually very far removed from my identity.So I don't feel a shred of motivation to continue my remaining 2 years, most likely I may fail a module here and there, and all of this is causing me an insane amount of stress and anxiety, especially when my parents want me to continue and get that degree. I also have a past medical history of a mental health issue and this got a lot worse recently and is affecting my studies especially given the situation from Covid.I do have my plan if I do drop out – I got to know of this private school called 3dsense in Singapore. Apparently, they rank #10 overall in 3D art schools in the world, and #3 in motion graphics and design. I was surprised that such a high-ranking school in 3D art existed in the country. Their requirements for admission is primarily passion, and some portfolio to prove that you do have some aptitude in any creative field.I am under Tuition Grant, so out of the 8 semesters of subsidized fees, I have already used up 4 in NUS. So if I quit, I have 4 remaining( roughly 2 years). But luckily 3dsense offers Tuition Grant and is only 12 months diploma course.Considering all these, my heart says that I want to quit and go into the scene where I would really enjoy what I am learning, but I am extremely afraid not of the social stigma I would receive from not having a university degree but from my parents, as they put in so much money and effort in my education and who are expecting me to get a degree from NUS.What would you do in my situation, in all honesty?-#99362: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99362",['No Reactions'],0 Comments,0 Shares

The thing is that my girlfriend is a few years older than me and taller than me. Initially we didn't mind and got together because we genuinely liked each other and can click very well, same interests, etc., but now that we're going out more often with dining in allowed and the honeymoon phase of our relationship is fading away, this difference is becoming more apparent to me. I would often tell myself to heck care what people think and see but doubt is creeping up on me leh. My friends sometimes jokingly tease me about our height and age difference and I know they laugh about it behind my back and it's honestly bruising my ego.

99349,"Yes, there is a Korean cult (not shincheonji) that has been actively recruiting NUS students throughout the years under a fake student group.I was approached by NUS seniors during open day at one of those booths they put up at central library area. They were giving out freebies like NUS pens and notebooks for people who signed up.They used a personality test called “Art Diagram Therapy” and paired you up with a senior or some kind of career coach. We were asked to draw shapes and they could somewhat say something about your personality (I was a freshie and a sucker for such things). I remember that some of them were not alumni of NUS and boasted that they had affiliations with other schools like NTU and SMU.I was with my friends so they split us up to do the consultation for the “Art Diagram Therapy”. It was done one-to-one (without the presence of the group of friends that were with me).The senior doing the consultation asked me about my interests and whether I had a purpose in life. I was told that I need to raise my level through religion and that they offered Bible mentorship which could be done anywhere on campus or according to my convenience.I met them several times at UTown and other parts of campus. They were nice and cheerful. Then I got invited to a concert at an industrial unit at Ubi Ave 1 Level 3 near Macpherson MRT. Turns out that most of the people who were manning the booth at NUS were from this “church”.After attending a few sessions of their so-called bible mentorship which introduced content like “three division, body-soul-spirit, miracle of sun-stop and parables”, I went to google the content and found that they are most likely from a Korean cult called “Providence”. Ghosted them after that but I was so freaked out and disgusted because most of their members seemed really young (I think some of them looked like they were from secondary school or JC.)Now that there are people speaking up about them, I think it’s important that all the people that were approached by them continue to provide information so that we can guard against such activities in the future.Perhaps NUS should be on high alert with regards to these matters.

99343,"My wife is pregnant in her first trimester, and she is currently unvaccinated. Before labelling her as “anti-social” as part of the unvaccinated population, let me explain why. There is no evidence or studies that vaccination will not cause long term deformity or harm to the development of the baby. Firstly, there is no insurance by the government or any institutions that if few years down the road, it is proven that vaccinations cause development problems to the baby.  What recourse does the parents in seeking physical or monetary compensations from the pharmaceutical companies or the government in pushing out vaccinations for pregnant women? According to CDC, pregnant women should be vaccinated because studies did not show there is an increased risk for miscarriage. How about long-term risk to the baby well-being, what does studies say about such risk? Our gynaecologist does not recommend my wife for vaccination for this reason. The government does not outright states vaccination is okay for pregnant women but to consult with your gynaecologist. The responsibility still lies with the parents to assess the risk. Secondly, even if there is support by the government for any negative side effects. Parents and the baby will endure the consequences for the next 70 years. The effects of any negative side effects will be with the person from baby to adulthood. The person can only endure it for the rest of his life. Can the child blame the mother for taking the vaccination? As stated by the gynaecologist, “If the baby turns out blind or has deformed limbs, is it worth it?”After weighing the risk involved, it is safe to assume that most pregnant women will stay unvaccinated till more conclusive evidence of risk of vaccinations on pregnant women or breast-feeding mothers. Pregnant women already have a hard time dealing with morning sickness and emotional mood-swings. Let us not simply label pregnant women as part of the “unvaccinated population”. So long as they continue to safe distancing measures, let us not “pressure” pregnant women to vaccinate.-#99343: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99343",['Like: 6 people'],0 Comments,0 Shares

99337,"I would like some advise please, I am evergreen and have little to no experience with relationships in general.So I have been working with this girl for a while as part of some project. We have been working together for a while now, but because of the COVID situation, we never managed to get together as a team and really know each other. I am also rather quiet and find it hard to put myself out there. But recently, I kind of realised/caught feelings for her, seeing her in a meeting for the project a while back. I realised that she embodied everything I wanted out of a relationship. We seem to get along fine during meetings and general banter. So I am definitely pursuing this however and by whatever means necessary, but I find myself unsure of how to handle this situation appropriately.Now comes the part where I need advice. I really like her and really want to pursue her. However, since we work together in the same team, and now that I have taken up a leadership position within the project, I don't want to play on this possible power dynamic and make things awkward for her. Also, I don't want to draw a mental connection between me and ""work"", as I really want to get to know her at a more personal level, and if not to get together with her, be close friends rather than just as parallel lines drawn together by the common goal of the project, to part once again as and when I leave. So there is this as one stumbling block that I have to overcome.Secondly, she is a freshman into university and living in hall. So I am also a bit concerned that she would be whisked away by some Prince Charming while I might never get the chance to take the shot. The other thing is that she is incredibly busy in University already right off the bat, so I can't find much time to really ask her out (which she agreed to previously but didn't manage to confirm because Phase 2). Meanwhile I am already in Year 3 and looking towards adult life, the workplace and something long term, which I am willing to wait for her. I am sure she is single at this point (miraculously), but I don't really know how I can ask her about her and my single status in a more casual setting and let it sit in her mind. I also don't know how to get her to ""like me back"" in the romantic sense, as I have never ever even swooned my dog, much less the girl of my dreams.I have decided to do my best to try and arrange sometime to go out with her for at least the next 3 months, and then if it doesn't pan out well, I will decisively just ask and pose the question. If it then doesn't go as I wish, I would do my best to stifle all romantic emotion involved and reset as platonic friends. Furthermore, as we are still working together in this project, I greatly value her contributions in that sense as well, and don't want to make things awkward between us.As such, how should I proceed in this situation?-#99337: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99337",['Like: 1 person'],0 Comments,0 Shares

99324,"To vaccinate or not?Your vaccination is not merely a personal decision but a SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.Yes, fully vaccinated individuals can still be infected but is much less likely to be infected. (https://www.imperial.ac.uk/.../coronavirus-infections.../) Are we not responsible for how our action or INACTION affects another person? Our “personal” action or decision (if we can label it as such), in this case, to be vaccinated or not, should not warrant a different treatment, provided it does not have any repercussion on the majority of the population who also resides in this country. Personal inconvenience of the unvaccinated is not reason to justify endangering the greater public. This is no different from the designated smoking corners to prevent the inhalation of second-hand smoke for the majority who do not smoke.In the hypothetical scenario that a later research study convincingly proves that vaccinated individuals are equally likely to be infected and hence subsequently infect others, only then can we start debating if this differentiated treatment should be done away with.Any adult who consciously choose not to be vaccinated in spite of the above should be required to make an official declaration and relinquish ALL subsidies to their healthcare treatment or quarantine requirements resultant of covid-19. They should also be least prioritized if a shortage of hospital beds becomes an issue as we have observed and continue to observe in many other countries. (https://www.straitstimes.com/.../hospitals-in-malaysia...)Why should tax payers pay more for the healthcare needs of selfish individuals who consciously choose not to be protected? We have limited resources and many needs. Assuming the role of a policy maker, I can choose to allocate the resources that would have been used on the unvaccinated ICU patients for other patients and their medical needs, and who are ill by no fault of their own!Why is a critically ill covid-infected adult who has chosen to unvaccinated more important than say my elderly grandma from the pioneer generation who has had a heart attack?For those who are still reading, I guess this is an analogy that summarizes the whole argument at hand.Let's assume the premise of a military unit in a period of conflict. As a commander, I have ensured that every soldier is issued a set of protective gear, helmets, armour plates, FAD etc (I.e. the vaccine). I have also provided the training for the proper fire movement to maximise your chances of survival (I.e. the proper hygiene routine, safe distancing and contact tracing).Then we have a soldier, let's call him Soldier M. Soldier M has access to all of the above but does not want to put on his helmet and armour plates nor practice the correct fire movement during an actual battle. His says ""wear helmet also not full protection, proper fire movement also still can get shot"" (just like how some argued that the vaccine is not 100% effective). And... its uncomfortable and inconvenient.In the unfortunate event that soldier M is shot and wounded in battle. Is it just soldier M who's paying the dues for his poor and selfish decisions? His section and comrades who were relying on him will inadvertently be compromised. (Just like how the family, colleagues and community will be affected by an infected individual) His comrade, let's call him soldier L, soldier L who was relying him for cover fire is now at greater danger, albeit exercising his personal responsibility to be properly equipped and exercising all the correct procedure based on their training. And yet another soldier will need to casevac soldier M, further reducing the number of soldiers on the frontline.Let's assume in the event that both soldier M and soldier L were severely injured in battle. We have 1 medic and enough medical resources to only save 1 of them. Who would you prioritize? The selfish soldier M who became a burden to his comrades because he was unwilling to bear with a little inconvenience? I say let the selfish bugger bleed out to his death.-L-#99324: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99324","['Haha: 2 people', 'Like: 1 person']",2 comments,1 share

The one lesson I have learned from him is the idea that yes, money is important, but if you chase money to the extent that you miss out on all the things that have greater meaning, you will end up 50, retired, and even if you may have accumulated a lot of wealth, life will be empty.

99312,"Hi Prof Ben,Originally joined this local tech company because of its portrayed diverse culture, only to get a culture shock that the company product/tech team has a very strong chinese internet company culture. While the official working language in the company is english, majority of the business meetings and technical discussions are held in chinese due to the large proportion (70-80%) of the team being Mainland Chinese. The team is no doubt very capable, however cant help but feel that the culture is discriminatory towards non chinese speaking employees. Feels like this similar workplace culture is becoming a commonplace in the tech industry due to a shortage of talents in the region and the arrival of the huge china tech companies.

99311,"My grandma is 85 years old. My grandpa has passed on a long time ago. Unlike many other people with heartfelt stories about their grandma, my grandma is not close to me at all. She has many grandchildren (more than 20). When i was a kid, my mom said she did not want to take care of me/my siblings but chose to take care of my other cousins. My mom had to quit her job and take care of us full time. Not sure why, but probably cause my dad was not the favourite son. It was pretty obvious that the other son was her favourite.As i grew up, my grandma has never asked me about my school or grades or anything at all. Basically we never talked. Even when i visit her I don’t remember having any conversation with her. I would usually greet her and ask her how is she, but that’s it. She has been this way towards me and all my siblings. All these while, she took in some of my cousins and raised them (they stayed at her place on weekdays, and went back to their parent’s place on the weekends).Writing up all the above, i feel sad. But that’s just how it is.I got married last year, and although she was unwell, she attended my ROM. I have not seen her since then due to covid restrictions etc. To be honest, i was happy about the covid restrictions so I don’t need to waste time to visit her only just out of obligation, not even love.My parents did visit her regularly and they mentioned she asked about me. She also gave her regards to me. This happened multiple times throughout the year. (It has never happened before).Suddenly i feel a little guilty for not visiting her. Of course a small part of me wishes to have a loving grandma while growing up and all, but it’s too late for that. I still resent her for how she treated my family (she also did not treat my parents well).

Both are straight porn stars and look like your typical porn star, big muscle, six pack and well hung. Their content is pretty much your typical porn, lots of sex with different girls.My girlfriend doesn't know that I know about her OnlyFans subscription as I accidentally stumbled upon them.

Without knowing this, after I turned 20, my parents would tell me the same thing every year as I grow older to be nicer to the girls around me and that it will be harder to find a partner after I graduate. I get that there is this sense of societal pressure to get married and that they might want their own grandchildren, but is it so wrong that I want to focus on building myself first before finding a partner? I just feel that I am not mature enough  and have not gotten over my previous relationship to find a new girlfriend (I know I'm a hopeless romantic, as it has been nearly 5 years but I cannot forget her). I don't want to hurt someone else and not be able to give my all to that person. My mindset is if it comes, it comes. If it doesn't I'm fine with staying single, because at least I can take care of my parents when they grow older. It just annoys me when people will try to set me up with other girls intentionally, encourage me to use dating apps on top of the continuous nagging from my parents.Anyone has advice how to deal with this and how to explain to their parents/people around them? Thanks!-#99294: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99294","['Like: 13 people', 'Care: 3 people']",0 Comments,3 comments
99303,"To all the girls, if you read this, I hope you won’t be like me – a woman who unintentionally destroyed a good man’s career, motivation, and confidence.It all started 3 years ago when he was in Australia studying for his final year of bachelor degree, while I already graduated and started my job. If I were to evaluate him now, I would rate him at least 9/10. He never cheated on me, he never once talked about or praised other girls in front of me, he was extremely focused on his studies and was a good example to his fellow course mates and younger siblings, his hobbies were mostly about self-improvement, career advancement, and learning new skills, which can be boring to most people, he would have Skype video call with me a few times a week when we were in LDR, and he was a caring boyfriend too. However sometimes things in life just didn’t happen in the way it should have happened. Back then he was just maybe 4 or 5 out of 10 to me, because I failed to appreciate him, and thus destroying both our relationship and his career.Just like any other girls, I get jealous too, but it’s not because my ex was very good-looking or attractive to other girls, but because of 2 things, first is he was being too helpful to the point where his female course mates would study with him, second is he treats everyone very nice, and I felt that as his girlfriend, he should treat me much better instead. So due to these reasons, we fought quite a number of times, despite being together for close to 3 years. He is also a person who doesn’t know how to defend himself or use the most appropriate words or sentences to explain himself, so during our fights, I was always the winner. And also I tend to go against his interest like programming and coding, because at that time I thought it was useless, why not just focus on your studies and be an expert in your own field, instead of wasting your time on something else that you might not even need in your future career, so we also fought about it, especially during some weekends where we visited each other’s place, and he just spent hours to learn those computing stuff. I mean it wasn’t actually that bad, but at that point of time I was already quite pissed with his interest, so seeing him spending so much time on it just got on my nerve even more.Although he only had to be in Perth for a year, I felt that it was actually quite long, especially back then I was still a pretty needy girlfriend, so eventually I started to be more suspicious, more jealous, and more insecure too. As usual, we would fight, but it was all because of my silly and unreasonable factors, like he added new female friends on facebook, and I went crazy and asked why he added them or accepted their friend request, and some are even angmohs. He did explain to me that the reason was because of group work, and it was easier to communicate and share information among group members through social media. Before our worst fight happened, this incident whereby his plan to return to Sg for a winter break was ceased. He decided to attend a workshop that he was interested in, and it only happened once a year during the winter break, and so he had to give up his flight back to Sg. I later found out that it was actually a web development course that costs a few hundred bucks. I totally went all crazy since I already disliked his interest in computing, and now he gave up on coming back to Sg just to waste his time to attend this rubbish course.The last straw came after a big misunderstanding. Now as I recall it again, it wasn’t actually a fight, it was just me being a big idiot. As we were having a video call, he told me that he was heading to bed after we finish talking, and I literally thought he would go to bed like he always did, but a few days later when I was scrolling through facebook, I saw his friends posts on another friend’s birthday celebration, and I saw him in those pictures and videos too, which he didn’t mention to me at all. After that, I took quite some time to compose a very long message to breakup with him. Right after sending him that message, I blocked him wherever possible where there was no way he could reach me. Some of our mutual friends tried to contact me too, but I thought they are much closer to each other, so they will help him cover up his lies, so I ignored them too. I went through a hard time by myself because I don’t have many close friends.After he returned to Sg, he came to my place to look for me to explain to me, but there was nothing that I could do about it because I was already attached to my then-fiancé. During his explanation, he said he was really going to bed, but that night was the birthday and farewell of another exchange student, and his friends were celebrating at their dorm and invited him too, so he just went down for a short while to say goodbye to him, and then went back to bed. He didn’t know that he had to share with me such 5-10 min activity that wasn’t so important. Regarding his winter course, it was actually a rare opportunity because some of the speakers were famous profs from ivy league like MIT, Harvard, cal-tech, and he said it is very rare to have such course in Sg, that’s why he chose to stay back instead of returning to Sg. At that time, I was already attached, so even if his explanations were valid, I could no longer accept him.It was only in the recent months I found out that my actions have severely impacted his life. He was an excellent student, but because of me, he failed to focus on his final sem, and did very badly in his final exam though he still passed. He previously wanted to study an MBA and CFA too, but little did I know that he had stopped pursuing his dream. With his resume and degree, he can easily find a decent job with around $3-4k as a fresh grad, but from what I heard from our mutual friends, he is doing a $2k+ job that only requires a diploma. Honestly I’m not that close to our mutual friends too because of that incident, but they did say the breakup had significantly caused who he is today. Although we have stopped talking, my friend actually passed me a hefty red packet on his behalf during my wedding solemnization. Knowing how little he earns, I felt bad to receive it, but I still did receive it as his form of blessing. I honestly have no idea whether he has any future plans, but apparently he has been working for the same low-pay position in same company for two years with little to no opportunity to progress.If you ask me, will I be with him again if I wasn’t attached, the answer will always be yes. Right now there is nothing I could do to rebuilt his confidence and motivation to pursue his dream anymore. I’m married, and I can only devote to my husband, but I feel deeply sorry for what I’ve done to him. If only I was mature enough to understand his situation, if only I knew he was happy doing what he enjoyed, if only I could resist the temptation to meet new guys before he returned to Sg, if only I could be more understanding to walk through difficult path with him. It only took me a few minutes to block him from reaching me, but these few minutes was what resulted in who he is today – a poor broken soul with so much potential to succeed in life. All he wanted at that point of time was just one very simple thing, which was my time to listen to his explanation, but I never gave him any chance to explain himself and ended our relationship when he was still studying overseas.So once again, to all the girls out there, if, if you ever happen to come across similar situation, please, please never be like me. Your ignorance to a guy may just be as easy as you thought, but you will never know how much of an impact on him you can make. There is no harm listening to explanation, especially when a guy is trying really hard, finding ways to reach you just to talk to you. It is easy to block a guy with just a few touches on your phone, but you will never know that you’re indirectly killing him from inside.Once again, I’m really sorry for what I did to you JL. If I could return to where we were 3 years ago, I would have listened to you, and you would have been much better than who you are today. I’m really sorry.-#99303: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99303","['Like: 104 people', 'Sad: 70 people', 'Haha: 20 people']",96 comments,112 shares

When B heard that, he was jealous and salty about it.I just feel that getting hired is not about having good grades anymore. In all honesty, I only had one job interview and I was lucky enough to get the role because I vibed really well with my supervisor. B on the other hand went for more than 5 interviews, but none of them offered him. I just felt like there must be something to do with his character or the way he portrayed himself.But that Beechhhh instead of reflecting on himself, he started to get jealous and spread rumours about me to my other friends.I just feel so upset.

99287,"People often say that GPA is all that matters: this is all bullshit.When COVID hit, many people graduate cannot find job. Even my friends with GPA second upper and above all cannot find job. This is because the university did not prepare students with the appropriate skills to face the working world. All students should wake up from the dream of meritocracy, clinging on to childish beliefs that “hardwork in school will give me good jobs” because there are too many entitled, self-obsessed, “smart” students who expect the society to hand jobs to them on a silver platter. Schools should spend more time slapping these entitled individuals to wake them from their dream land.Nowadays employers look more at social skills, EQ, internship experiences, etc. to hire. Sadly, even being a NUS graduate nowadays is not enough to guarantee a job offer.-#99287: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99287","['Like: 4 people', 'Haha: 1 person']",0 Comments,1 comment

99277,"In my final semester of study, I (25/M) finally got a diagnosis of ADHD (inattentive), which made everything click for me. I always performed considerably worse than all my course mates, even though I’m taking a reduced workload for all my semesters of study.

Getting Bs and Cs for every single module I’ve taken doesn’t feel very good. While my parents are very supportive, I feel like I’m letting them down. All the effort I’m putting in doesn’t really matter since I learn extra slow and have nothing to show for it.On top of this, I have not made a single friend in uni (probably because I don’t attend classes). While I’m not desperate for a partner, the yearning is still there. While I don’t consider myself ugly, being on several dating apps with little to no luck hurts my self-esteem.

99274,"[In serious need of advice]Before anyone judges me too harshly, I just want to put it out there - also for those who are in the workforce and unfamiliar with the university landscape now. University is stressful and for many who have a part-time job to fund our high university fees and are unable to cope with the workload, ghostwriters have been the solution. There are so many ghostwriters on platforms such as Carousell. I found a highly-rated ghostwriter business that is a Singapore Registered Business. Hired their service for a project and it was satisfactory. Hence, as I was stressed out juggling the workload from many modules, I decided to hire their service once more for my online exams. In the end, the online exams were outsourced and badly done - answers were found on google and not paraphrased at all. I failed the exams and was marked for plagiarism with disciplinary consequences. As much as I am at fault for hiring someone to take my online exam for me, I feel that the business should take responsibility too. I did pay quite a sum for the services.I am writing to seek your opinions and thoughts on whether I should publish a full review publicly online (with screenshots and details) to prevent other students from potentially falling for the same thing with them. Currently, the business has a perfectly clean record on Carousell. I'm sure the business will never allow me to publish my negative review there so I am thinking of a public online blog post of the sort.-#99274: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99274",['No Reactions'],0 Comments,0 Shares
99273,"Dear admin, i hope you won't filter my post.I have joined my current company for 2 months, holding a managerial post. After I joined, I found out that my subordinate applied for my position but she didn't get it.  Then I got to find out that she has also applied for my position 2 years ago and didn't get it as well. The best part is, her buddy (from another dept) in the company also applied for the manager position in her dept and didn't get it. So both of them bitch about how sucky the company is but they never wanna resign.Because of this, I became the ""victim"". She does not talk to me unless work-related. On a daily basis, we barely talk. Sometimes, we don't even talk for days. She do her work and I do my work. I tried to be nice, I greeted her, care for her by asking how's her day but she is friendly to everyone except me. There were a couple of times I asked to do something and her response was, ""no need lah, here is like that, no need one"" or ""ya ya, I done already, all I do already"". When I asked her for help on where to find certain documents, she refuse to tell me and say she will send me the attachment. If not, she just say ""oh, it's there, in the folder there, you go and search"".I asked my fellow colleague, another manager, for help. He suggested me to ""buy her in"" with food and whatsoever. So I tried, but doesn't seem to work as well (maybe I only bought her once or twice). And it is not in me to do this. Why should I buy her in? Isn't it ""default"" to have some basic professionalism and team work in your daily work?My partner suggested ""top-down"" approach. If there's anything she refuse to do, just tell her that I am her boss and she has to do. This is not me to do this either. I just wanna do my work and have good teamwork to improve work processes and deliver good service to our customers.My boss is aware of what's happening cause that's what happened to my predecessor. I have recently spoken to my boss on my subordinate's contract renewal cause she is approaching 67 and my boss said he's happy to renew her. My world simply crashed! Maybe I should have spoken up more explicitly on what is happening but, he knows! So I don't know if speaking up again will make it looks like I CMI or just being bad at managing people.

99272,"Seeking advise to help for my husbandI am a 33 years old working mum of 2 son, 4 and 2 years old. My husband is 30 this year but he is very lazy.I met my husband through a common friend 5 years back when he just returned from studies in the UK. We hit off pretty well as he's witty and humorous plus he secured a very good career in an MNC company and decent family. I'm comfortable with him taking the lead and planning for everything so I usually don't have any inputs for his decision despite him always asking me for it.I got my legs swept off by him and agreed to marry him after 1.5 years of relationship. But things start to change much after marriage. He became very lazy whenever I asked him to do stuffs. Like when I asked him many times to get a driving license, he said that he never actually needed one as he has someone to chauffeur him around and taking PHV or cab is cheaper than owning a car in Singapore unlike UK. I was pretty upset when he said that as a car would be convenient for checkups for my gynae visits and meeting up with my friends. He does not help out much in housework except for washing of clothes, windows cleaning and fans as there are much more things to do apart from these. He will usually lounge around or sneak off to go for exercise once he is completed with those chores while I need to look after the kids. I told him there are many other chores to do but he always said that he will do later but never did.His working hours are pretty hectic as he will usually reached office by 8.30am and will only reached home by 8pm. As I finished work earlier, I will usually picked up my kids from childcare and buy dinner, which is quite tiring when my cab doesn't arrived on time or when the food delivery doesn't come early and need to tend to hungry kids. Travelling can be pretty tiring even via taxis. I always tell him to cab home but he likes to travel by MRT as it helps to save cost. Cabbing home can reduce an hr of travelling time which he can help me to tend to kids when i'm tired and he's earning a high 6 digit figure per annual, I can't figure out why he is so petty on money when I'm only earning  1/3 of his salary. Although he pays for all the cab rides and food but I just want him to share the load of actual parenting. I felt so overwhelm by the fatigue that I actually quit my job to take care of the kids when my 2nd kid was born. I told my husband that he should spent more time to take care of the household but he often use work or a need to exercise as an excuse. I don't understand why he needs to choose timing to go for exercise. For weekdays, he has free time from 11pm onwards, but he can choose to go straight after work. For weekends, it's even worse, he can opt for timing like 1 to 3pm where the kids are usually sleeping or 10pm onwards but he choose timing like 6am in the morning or 5pm in the evening when the kids are awake or going to be awake.Things start to have a strange turn of events when he mentioned that he wants to quit his job and spend time. I felt very happy and relieve when he said that. But the downside is that, he told me that I may have to look for a job as he could have difficulty finding a job that has work life balance and decent salary. I was happy and disappointed at the same time, but I guess that's life. So I agreed and he quit his job and he's taking care of the kids at home while I went back to the workforce after 2 years of being a housewife. Things are doing great for me as the workplace is good and the pay is much higher than my previous job, but not for my husband. He has difficulty finding a manager entry level job as he is over qualified, having armed with an Imperial College degree and INSEAD MBA, he has difficulty finding a job that support work life balance and decent salary when he is willing to take up to a 75% pay cut. Despite being at home, I find that the status of the house cleanlines is not up to my standard when I can find small peck of dust on the window grill when I do my spot check and he still has the tired feel when he doesn't even need to work. I don't understand why can't he take care of the house when I'm earning the dough. When confronted, he said that he is making pretty good money while being a day trader and suggested that we should get a maid to do the menial work while both of us earn the money but I don't like strangers to stay with us. I also urged him to be more active on job hunting as we have expenses to pay for. I need his contributions for my parent housing loan and our utility and my cab expenses. Luckily our 5 room is fully paid thanks to his investment. He's pretty lazy as his day trading can fetch about 5k for good months and 3k for bad month and has a emergency savings for 10 years without working, but it can be embarrasing for a guy to be unemployed for long time.I asked my friends for advise but their responds are pretty mixed and I'm also dried up for solutions, which is why I would like to sought for more options to get my husband to help out more.-#99272: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99272","['Haha: 134 people', 'Like: 61 people', 'Angry: 36 people']",332 comments,198 shares

I am very sure I am not intending to get married nor is there any family pressure to do so. I have always wanted to get a property but I can’t afford private and have to wait 10 years to get a resale flat. Hence, I am looking for a single female to BTO with. We will not have any relationship, intimacy etc, just as partners to buy BTO. Any age is ok with me as long as we meet the income criteria and can live harmoniously as housemates. My plan as follows:- Get a new 5 room BTO, we split the cost equally - each of us take one room, rent out the other 2- After 5 years MOP, sell and we split the profit- get another new 5 room and repeat the process - After we sell the 2nd flat, we can split off- I could probably afford a private property by thenWe would thus live as housemates for 10 years+.

99263,"Hi guys, I recently rented a place from Dec 2020-Aug 2021. I moved in with another girl. This girl I said with was quite untidy and had been staying in the house for 2.5 yrs. On handover the owner was super pissed and deducted 70% of the deposit to which I mentioned I got the place in that condition and due to urgency I took and have the pics from when I moved in. The problem is when I moved in that condo the agent mentioned to this girl(main tenant) that no need to add my name in existing contract rather he'll send her a template where in I have a room rental with her. When I asked for my deposit back as my room is in same condition (infact cleanliness miles better than how I got) agent sees you need to get it from her. She gave me only the amount that she got from the owner which is not equivalent to how much I paid as deposit and she literally ran away in grab until I could get message of how much I received. She was also arguing with me on how I owe her coz I stayed there for 8 months. I texted her that I need my full amount as the agent and owner both mentioned they have no complaints with me she started saying she doesn't have money and I need to wait until she gets our pub deposit back but to be frank how can I trust her when she literally ran away.

There were many occasions that they fought and quarreled but somehow patch up after a while. On the day that she committed suicide she called me in the night and told me that she was really sad that after such a long period of relationship, her boyfriend couldn't trust her and suspect that she is having an affair with another guy. At that moment, I told her that maybe she should move on with her life, and shouldn't stay in this relationship anymore, since it is giving her so much heartache. She didn't say anything after that and the next thing I knew is that she committed suicide, I feel really tormented in my heart and I regretted, if I were to show her more support maybe she wouldn't have left.-#99256: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99256","['Sad: 133 people', 'Care: 101 people', 'Like: 63 people']",37 comments,34 shares

99250,"Dear Prof Ben , I have accepted both an offer from NUS to study Humanities and Sciences ( major in chemistry )  and an offer to study Chemistry in University of Oxford . My parents were very supportive and proud that I got accepted to go UK and it’s my dream to study in University of Oxford. However I am in a dilemma now .  Last week , I overheard my dad telling my mum that it will cost around $500k (Tuition fees + living expenses + flights etc ) for a 4 year course and he is not at all sure because I am not studying a specialised course such as medicine which “guarantees”  a certain income level so long I do not screw up along the way. My mum was on the other end fighting to let me go because she knows it’s my interest to study chemistry and she believes I will get to learn from the best in the University of Oxford and she does not mind slogging more years to earn back the money . My parents do not require me to pay them back the money.  Neither do they want me to apply for bonded scholarship for fear that I miss out on greater opportunities after graduation .I really need all your advice . Assuming I become a scientist / researcher or a University professor , how many years will it take for me to save up $500k to return my parents because I feel really bad here . I don’t mind working hard to return them before I start saving for myself . I am happy with simple life , no branded goods , simple dining , public transport , public housing etc so Long I get to study what I like and be a scientist . My dream is to invent things that can improve the lives of people , doesn’t matter if I am not as well paid .  If I cannot find a girlfriend because I cannot pay for her lifestyle , I rather be single also . Or should I consider what my dad say ? Ie. If I am studying a general degree , just stay in Singapore and I will do just fine without incurring such a huge debt . I also want to say that I do not wish to study medicine just because I am more likely to earn bigger bucks.  I want to be happy in life doing what I like and having a purpose in life everyday when I go to work ,even if it means earning lesser money . My friend watched The Big Bang Theory where a smart researcher earns lesser than his not so smart girlfriend who works in pharmaceutical sales , and mock me at my decision . However ,  I am very certain what I want to do because to me ,happiness is not money and owning things . But I feel very bad if I can’t earn enough to return my parents and my mom has to delay her retirement plans because of me . My mum is 52 and my dad is 58 already . My sister is in 2nd year poly and she may have to go overseas if she can’t qualify for local U.  What should I do ..? Should I just stay in Singapore NUS ( humanities and sciences) or should I follow my heart and go University of Oxford ?-#99250: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99250","['Like: 113 people', 'Care: 28 people']",175 comments,40 shares

We are each other’s first partner, I’m born with a golden spoon and his family requires financial assistance. Initially I was attracted to him because of how he pays attention to me, takes care of me and would plan little surprises etc etc but now that we’re at the 7 years mark, everything’s gone. I mean we still love each other, but I think it’s evolving into another kind of love… like family? Anyways recently I can’t help but to compare him to guys around me, because everyone seems so smart, polished and driven while he’s always treating me like a mum and walking encyclopedia, asking me for advices etc. I don’t know how much longer do I have to wait for him to grow up and become a man. I love him, I love his kindness but at the same time I’m running out of patience. Also, I’m worried that he might have a change of heart when he enters the “society”, when he meets new people etc. By then I would’ve lost almost 8-9 years of my youth. Side note: my dad wants me to get married asap while his dad told him to take his time and build his career first.

99568,"Controversial. Please do not delete. Meant to encourage discourse.As a YNS alum, I'm actually glad about the decision to dissolve YNS because it has been from the start, a manifestation of Singaporean prestige-whoring to just a ridiculous degree. This whole experiment has never not been confusing. Why would Yale, a tier-one research institution whose affiliates have won multiple Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes, whose alumni have gone on to become American presidents and supreme court justices, be interested in lending their star-studded history in a project with a university a fraction of its stature? Were it not for the money that they stood to earn for the project, an Ivy League university like Yale would never in a million years consider such a collaboration, especially if it means its name has to be bastardized in such a way. They could just have easily called it anything else. Literally anything else. We have done it before. SUTD wasn't named MIT-NUS, and SMU wasn't named Wharton-NUS. Clearly something was fishy from the start. This didn't matter to my parents, to whom the word ""Yale"" was all they needed to force a decision onto me. This project occurred because Yale was willing to pimp out its brand for a good sum of money, and someone was willing to sanction any decision to make NUS seem a lot more world-class than it actually is. YNS students were never going to be good enough to be admitted to Yale. You can cite acceptance rates and whatever but the fact is that these numbers are inflated. It costs nothing to send an application to Yale-NUS as a Yale prospect, and Yale-NUS clearly wasn't going to jeopardize their yield by accepting students who were never going to come to Singapore anyway. If we simply removed all those Americans whose applications have indicated that they wished to apply to Yale-NUS, just out of convenience and not out of sincerity, the acceptance rate would probably turn out similar to NUS.What we end up getting is a bunch of holier-than-thou SJW-types who would have otherwise have no choice but to be in NUS, being banded together in an echo chamber where far-left ideas, on pain of excommunication, are never held to the acid test of textbook Singaporean pragmatism.Wasn't it a Yale-NUS alumni who got themselves into trouble after releasing a viral video that clearly demonstrates the kind of ""frontier justice"" that promotes aggressive activism? I actually stand by them in principle. But the idea that the only way to change a society is by being angry is childish. If we could change the prejudices of the older generation overnight, LKY wouldn't have had to take his entire life to fail to fix the third-world mentality in Singapore. The decision to wind up the college is good. Liberalism is mostly good.

I got divorced about 2 years ago and currently I’m in a relationship with this guy who’s in his 30s who is also a divorcee with a kid. Some information about this guy. He’s decent looking. He seemingly has mostly the right value and principles in life. Character wise he’s okay, but two things that I can’t stand. He’s hot tempered and I come to realise kind of wishy washy. He is not exactly doing very well. I earn more than he does. He’s in debt and he’s has difficulty scraping through every month. We practically go dutch (I pay more sometimes) on dates because of this. He has his own space and he is renting out to his ex gf and sister (Malaysian zzz) and the rent helps with his finances (still barely scraping if you ask me). Because of this, I have never been unable to go up to his place openly. For the duration of time we are together, we are always quarrelling about this matter. 1. At first he was suppose to get the gf and the sister to move out. But not done. On the account that the rental does help with his finances. I relented. 2. I am only asking for a simple request. I should not be barred from gg up to his place isn’t it? Or am i expecting too much. But it takes so long to get one thing settled.3. He gives the reason that he’s looking for the right time to talk to the ex-gf. He is afraid the ex will be unhappy and decide to look for a better place to stay (loss of rental), or worse case scenario if she’s not over him, she might kill herself. 4. Despite breaking up already for more than a year. Yes wtf - is he thinking too much? Or is this an excuse idk. Freaking foreign girls seriously. We are not looking to get married (becos really that’s overrated, if you ask me). But I find myself feeling stupid and sore to be compromising on this matter. I get nothing out of this, and it is not as if the a portion of the rental goes to me. I’m bitter about it. I dk whether to give up on him. Everytime I try to, he will crawl his way back and I’ll end up relenting. I find myself becoming more bitter about the relationship but idk how to let him go. It’s probably hurting my ego to be with such a person but yet, losing him on such grounds hurts my ego too. I mean, I can be happily single or find a better person out there. But really… people have asked what’s holding me back from giving him up. 1. He’s keeps me company.. a decent company, I guess. 2. The sex; not too bad. We have the same drive and it keeps the relationship gg I guess. But I’m beginning to doubt if we can go on for long term. We can’t communicate because whenever we touch on sensitive topics as above he shuts off. Yes, he does crawl back everytime we quarrel, looking for me, eventually but it feels like this relationship really isn’t gg anywhere. Because everytime I think of the problem he brings on the table, I feel shortchanged. I no longer knows if I truly want him back because of I love him or if it’s really because I don’t wanna be single. Yet I find it very tough to continue working on the relationship with him as it’s just tiring to keep quarrelling about the same issues over and over again. I don’t understand why I even need to ask for basic decency about the ex-gf matter.

99422,"Hi I’m the OP from #98895. Having met more than 10 different guys within the span of half a year, I just wanted to share some observations that hopefully may be helpful for you if you’re using apps!#1 - never trust a guy blindly until he proves it with his actions over time. If a guy tells you that he is looking for something serious, give him the benefit of doubt but don’t fully trust him until he proves it. I’ve mistrusted the wrong guy who told me that he wanted to settle down but turned out he was just looking for FWBs. And his game was damn solid, the way he talked to me, treated me and planned our dates was NOT the typical trajectory of how a FWB relationship would usually look like. He would even spend hours talking to me on the phone everyday. In the end, he put out after I revealed that i was not that keen to proceed too fast physically. #2 - Don’t ever dupe yourself into thinking a guy is interested in you if he texts you everyday BUT doesn’t proactively initiate to meet you. Most likely, this guy is just looking for a text buddy ???? Sometimes, us girls will try to cling on to the hope that if he carries on the convo, or even double / triple texts us when we didn’t reply instantly, he is interested. sure… but I think most importantly if he doesn’t actively tries to meet you, most likely he isn’t THAT interested.From my experience, I have been texting this guy almost everyday for about 6+ months. During this 6+ months, I’ve dated others, some consisting of only 1-2 dates and two of them I’ve dated 1-3 months. Funny thing is, this 6months + guy was so-called the longest standing “date” but we have only met once ???? Ever since that one time we met up, he did drop hints on meeting again but never proactively plan a date. And a few times when I did not reply him, he will double text me again.In the end, I decided to ghost for good cos’ I was too lazy to reply and I wasn’t interested enough either. But yes based on my experience, it’s quite absurd to me that someone can bother to keep tabs and text another person consistently for 6 entire months without even wanting to meet the person!!! But I guess the world is full of strange people with strange motivations. #3 When they say that dating apps allow you to expand your social network and meet people you don’t usually encounter in your daily life, it’s true.. in a good or bad way depending on your luck. I know I’ll get roasted (especially by guys) on the point below but i am sure most girls will agree with meWhat I meant in my previous post about lowering my standards was because 1) honestly speaking, the amount of good looking girls on the apps way surpassed the amount of good looking Sporean guys who dress well on the app. I honestly don’t think I’m very picky already in terms of choosing someone based on his looks but the ”quality” of Sporean guys on the apps is really quite appalling. To the extent that out of 10 profiles, only 1 is average looking with a 5/10 rating looks wise. Sometimes it’s 0 out of 10 profiles who are average looking lol. 2) I think I’ve a bad habit of always trying to convince myself that maybe the person will look better in real life as compared to photo only to feel disappointed most of the time. I think part of me is just tired of restarting the whole process so I would rather meet this person I’ve been talking to for x number of weeks first and reevaluate from there.so my naïveté & the fact that there’re so few decent looking guys on the apps prompted me to give guys I won’t even give a second glance, a chance. And I think most girls might be able to relate to this.-#99422: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99422","['Like: 12 people', 'Wow: 2 people']",10 comments,7 shares
99421,"In Nus, I struggled significantly with my mental health due to a couple of episodes where my physical health was compromised. I fainted a couple of times and these events led to severe panic attacks. This harrowing experience ,that lasted for four years, taught me key and valuable lessons that I hope others can relate to and maybe adopt for themselves. Caveat: What I write is genuinely what I went through and made sense for me but the lifestyles and personalities of everyone else is varied and so if it does not make sense for you, there is no need to adopt it. 1) Learn to find what exactly you enjoy about being in university rather than only seeing it as a burden to complete or seeing it as a perpetual rat race. University is not only a time to excel grades-wise, but it is also a time to build yourself and your personality. Constantly being worried about grades, beauty, relationships and money will only lead to you being depressed and unhappy, while suppressing your genuine inner personality. It is when you shift your mindset to making yourself happy and finding ( people, events, places, activities) to discover who you are, will you have the confidence and develop that bright spark to achieve the rest. I find that 90 percent of the time, it was the reverse where people were drowning in insecurities and compromising what they would genuinely want, in order to achieve what they think they must have. ( ie. Everyone is doing A and so i must do A, even if I dont actually want to or feel ready for it )  Sure at the end of four years, you may have got that first class honours or you may have achieved a certain financial target. Question is: Do you feel proud or just relieved that you made it? If its relief, then you still struggle with an insecurity and base your self-worth on this. It will come to a point where you have made so many compromises to achieve what you think you must have, that you end up being bitter and possibly shallow. For me, because I was impacted by my circumstances, I really had to create environments that would make me happy and help me to feel safe. This led to me joining everything under the sun - from pilates, to dance, astronomy, social dancing and going out of my way to talk to exchange students. I decided to explore my interests, in spite of my grades taking a downward spiral and my self-confidence deteriorating. I found that I actually discovered so much more and it led to me actually figuring out what i wanted to major in and eventually,I turned my grades around so by the time i hit my honours year, I scored straight A's. This is not to say Im less bitter or shallow, its just that I was more at peace with my journey than others who seemed to despise the journey and associated their time in uni as highly stressful and competitive.2) Your intelligence is not tied to your grades. Read this again. okay and again. Read this as many times as you need so you can internalise it. okay now let's try another one: You can be intelligent even if you have poor grades. Having entered university from the JC, and having been in a competitive cca for more than 10 years - I firmly believed the only good and valuable thing about me was my grades. Then uni hit and that went down the drain. Then I realised, there were people I met who understood different things about life that honestly made them intelligent. One knew and deeply understood people, so she knew how to navigate relationships. Emotional intelligence is so important and when you go out into the working world, you will realise that it is this trait combined with confidence that helps you to thrive. There was another who was entrepreneurial and knew where to find the lobang and how to create the lobang. May not have been perfect with the theories or the essays but she could spot opportunities and knew how to cash them. One was a perfectly gifted orator with many unconventional ideas - led to her writing a CV that got her into a top consulting firm despite average grades. There are so many other forms of intelligence and if you can train yourself to start looking away from grades as the almighty one, you may realise that the world is much bigger and has more depth. This is not to say grades are not important- it is but not to the extent we as a society has priced them to be. Overall, I hope this helps and I wish all of you the best in the paths you take and lifes you choose to lead-#99421: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99421","['Like: 2 people', 'Sad: 1 person']",0 Comments,1 share

99406,"My bf has a close female friend - that friend that guys would tell their gf that there’s nothing to worry about. They’re good friends, not bffs but he often shares important news and updates with her and regularly catch up with her. She knows his family and extended family while I have yet to meet any despite being in a relationship with him for a year. Im not particularly concerned about their relationship but my friends kept telling me that something is very off about this friendship dynamic. My bf had previously confessed to his female friend 3 times over 4 years but she turned him down and they remained as good friends. She’s not in any of his cliques so they often hung out 1-on-1. Each time they went out to eat with one another (~every 2-3 months) he would drive up to fetch her and bring her to a high end restaurants, and the bill often goes up to $300++, of which he pays for it 8/10 times. Their meetups often lasted between 4-6 hours everytime, which others say its relatively long for a catch up session as it could go slightly past midnight occasionally. However, he always make sure to keep me updated when he meet with him. On the other hand, he would bring me to eat in hawker centres, fast food places or purchase ready made food from 7-11/donki, not that I complain because they’re delicious! But we never had a fancy date due to budget constraints and i always paid for my share of the meals too or even pay for both of our meals. He would also ask for me to pay for it at the end of the day. My friends are saying that treating a friend, particularly someone he used to like (or still likes) for expensive meals while not doing the same for me, his gf, is a red flag and i should have a talk with him about it. As he was very open about his interactions with his female friend to me and is willing to disclose such information, i generally do not feel jealous or be suspicious about it. Furthermore, i feel that meeting his family would be something i would do in the future, not at present as we are both busy with school and work. But is this issue something i be concerned with and clarify with him about?-#99406: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99406",['Like: 3 people'],5 comments,3 shares
99405,"Has anyone ever tried to feedback to NUS on unfair treatment by internship supervisor? For context, I'm on IA (under FOE) this semester and the IA mod is pass/fail. Despite this being my first internship, I'm putting in my best effort to learn and contribute as much as I can, sometimes even OT-ing at night/weekends to get my tasks done. As a startup intern, there're many things to be done and sometimes, I'd want to do them as efficiently as possible. Here comes the problem. Although I want to do things quickly, I lack experience in finding the fastest possible way (probably because it's my first time doing the task). The moment my supervisor sees this, ___ immediately jump to the conclusion that I'm being lazy. I have tried explaining but there's no use at all. Apart from this, ___ has also threw (very) personal attacks and (sometimes) vulgarities at me. As much as I know that I shouldn't be bothered by these, it still hurts me deeply as I go out of my way to complete the tasks, only to receive hurtful remarks like this. As you probably inferred, there are many more things that sadden and hurt me, but I won't go into detail because it'll make this post too depressing. I am more than willing to continue going out of my way for the company, as long as this situation gets better (maybe someone might lecture me for being naive and stupid, but I really do not mind contributing more to the company). But for now, I can't help but have a mental breakdown after work everyday. Should I reveal some fragments of my grievances to the school during compulsory consultation? What should I do?

99396,"I am 25 and I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD a few years ago. In the beginning, it was very distressing and crippling to the extent where it would interfere with my daily activities and life. One time I had a major anxiety attack and refused to leave a public toilet for 4 hours, which led to my parents freaking out bc I was uncontactable and we had a family dinner that evening. It then got better when I started uni in September that same year. The first two years were a challenge bc I had a heavy workload and was constantly feeling anxious and on edge all the time. Little things would trigger me easily. Things got better during the third year onwards when my psychiatrist started prescribing me a medication that worked for me and my condition. However, my anxiety/OCD did not fully go away. It would still come and go whenever it pleases. However, I have to say that during the last few years, my condition has improved a lot. It would occasionally come and when it does, it is serious, but not as serious as the toilet incident.Anyway, my gf and I went to the arcade one night. We were having such a good time, until the last 5 mins of our visit there when we were counting our tickets. She wanted to do something which I didn’t want her to bc I knew it wouldn’t work. She went ahead and did it anyway, which really triggered my anxiety and my OCD started to flare up. In the moment, I said to her “I told you alr right, you so stupid.” I knew I fucked up right after bc she really hates it when people call her stupid/dumb and I could also tell from her facial expression. She also has a very bad temper. We didn’t talk at all during the whole ride back from suntec to Yishun. I was depressed again.Even though my gf knows about my mental condition and we’ve been together for a year, I don’t think she fully understands what I’m going through and the extent of my condition (which I don’t blame her at all bc even my parents don’t get it and I’ve been told many times by people and my ex-counselor that these are all “irrational” thoughts). I am aware of that and sometimes I feel like I’m just going fucking crazy and start hating myself.Does anyone have any advice for me? -#99396: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99396","['Like: 9 people', 'Care: 5 people', 'Sad: 4 people']",21 comments,2 shares
99395,"TLDR; I recently found out my boyfriend of 3 years paid for sex (prostitutes) when he was younger and question his values because he introduced the world of prostitutes to his married brother.This is gonna be REALLY long, but I'm seeking for advice on my situation. I have a boyfriend of 3 years and he really loves me (vice versa). He will always put my needs before him and is faithful during the span of our relationship. However, I recently found out about something he did when he was in his early 20s that makes me question him/our relationship. To elaborate on what happened, he was young and single (and kind of desperate) back then, so he paid for prostitutes to satisfy his needs. I understand from his standpoint because they have their needs, and his only outlet then was paying for sex. I guess it's the same idea as people having one-night stand and the only difference is he paid for it so I'm actually not judging his promiscuous lifestyle back then since it was before he met me. But what made me angry/sad was his selfishness of not letting me know when we first started this relationship, and instead only telling me 3 years down our relationship (read along the lines of potentially contracting STDs). Yes, he got himself checked and he is clear (but what if the hypothetical 0.000001% chance he was not?). I personally feel that he is really selfish for not letting me know and he could at least let me know out of respect at the start of our relationship. Whether or not I want to commit to this relationship even after he disclose his past is my choice. What he told me was, he really cherishes our relationship, and he is scared that I will leave him after he tells me the truth (especially since it's the beginning of the relationship and stakes were still pretty low). I thought it was really selfish of him to do that. Because it's really a fact right now that I'm 3 years invested in this relationship and the stakes are so high that I can't just walk away. I felt really angry because I FELT (personal opinion) he got exactly what he wanted and I'm really playing in the palm of his hand. Disclaimer, he is faithful to me and treats me really well now. He isn't cheating on me or visited prostitutes during our relationship. But I can't help but feel anger towards his selfishness.I know what some of you might say, let the past be the past. He isn't obliged to tell me, and a lot of guys actually have similar past but they don't usually tell their other half to ""protect"" the relationship, etc. So yes, I acknowledge that and I really appreciate him telling me the truth. But there's more to this story than the above, which made me question him/his values.Timeline: this was also during his early 20s when he was living his best life as described above. He has a brother who is very much older than him. Back then his bro was married to his wife (not sure how long they were married for, but they were together for at least 10 years). I am also not sure how the marriage spiralled, but there was once my bf and his bro went for a drink and his bro told him about how there might be something going on between him and his MARRIED female colleague. At that point in time when his bro told him, the cheating hasn't happened YET. But what really irked me was my bf's suggestion/advice to his bro. He told his bro something along the lines of ""if you're just itching, I have contacts for prostitutes. But DON'T ever start a relationship with your female colleague. She is married ffs"" (paraphrased). When he told me this, my mind was blown because he clearly thinks it's less of an issue when it comes to physical cheating vs emotional cheating (disclaimer: I get it that some people think physical and emotional cheating are different things altogether, but what I'm trying to drive at is that I PERSONALLY am against both physical and emotional cheating, hence the idea is more about my bf and my personal values are not aligned). He said in his defense, he currently thinks both physical and emotional cheating are equally bad. He was young and pretty drunk and he is aware now that his values were questionable back then. Anyway, his bro eventually cheated physically AND emotionally and the marriage broke apart. After introducing his bro to the world of prostitutes, his bro engage in such services frequently (after he and his wife divorced). Let's talk about temptation. Recently my bf and his bro were casually eating (and drinking) along the streets of Geylang, and his bro was itching. So he told my bf he's gonna find prostitute, and HAD THE AUDACITY to ask my bf if he wanted to go as well. Mind you, his bro is 100% aware of my existence and we literally hangout together (as a trio). I'm talking about going out for meals and even travelling together as a trio. More than anything, I really lost ALL respect for his bro and I simply do not want to have any interaction with him EVER. In my bf's defense (once again), he didn't agree to it/didn't cheat on me and was waiting outside the chicken coop instead. He also said his bro could be just joking when he asked him if he wanted to come along. Like if my bf were to agree to it, his bro would most probably question him if he was serious. But hey, this is a mystery we'll never unravel. My bf is all about giving his bro the benefit of doubt, but they are family after all, so you will surely side family no? Doesn't matter to me, I simply lost all respect for his bro as a person because he's got really questionable morals (to me, not my bf). It really got me thinking about how it's a vicious cycle of temptations. Back then he introduced his bro to the world of prostitutes and unknowingly enabled his ""physical"" cheating ways. Right now it circled back such that his bro could possibly and easily enable my bf to cheat, so my bf could possibly be more prone to cheating. I know I sound really paranoid and pathetic, but I really can't help thinking in this 0 to 100 way because my logical state of mind is failing me. I don't know how/what to think about this and I really need some advice/enlightenment (his selfishness, potential temptations, etc.) I'm also finding it really difficult to reconcile with the whole physical vs emotional cheating theory he mentioned back then. Although he regretted what he said, it still makes me question his innate values. It just kind of planted this seed of insecurity/doubt in me such that in the future if he ever itches, he can simply go about his philandering ways? Although he isn't cheating on me today, but what if he cheats on me a year later? 3 years later? 10 years later? The stakes are only going to get higher as time goes by. He says he won't cheat, but all guys say the same bs. I'm just thinking in the future, will I ever look back at my stupid self today for seeing the red flags but not acting on it by leaving this relationship just because he hasn't cheated YET. P.s. appreciate if you can give me some tips to deal with his bro in case we are ever forced to be in the same setting because I'm not going into the whole ""if your bro and I drop into the sea, who will you save first"" rabbit hole. Seriously, I wear my heart on my sleeve and I simply can't hide my disdain towards people I have no respect for.-#99395: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99395","['Like: 13 people', 'Haha: 5 people', 'Sad: 3 people']",47 comments,8 shares
99392,"Hi. How do you deal with elderly parents who constantly go to the clinic? Or even A&E/call an ambulance when it is NOT an emergency? For example, my mom felt dizzy one day and she thought she was going to die. Called the ambulance, went to the hospital etc, and it turned out to be nothing. This was on a weekday night at midnight. The worse was when she went to A&E in the morning for constipation. It turned out to be nothing. She said she was worried it will be appendicitis cause her friend went for appendix surgery a few months back. She said she was also worried about it being colon cancer since it is difficult to detect colon cancer. She told me she is glad they did xrays and blood tests for her. she mentioned previously she had constipation and went to a clinic, they just gave her meds without any xrays and blood tests. I was speechless. She was not even in pain. She also wanted to see a specialist. On the SAME DAY in the afternoon, she felt nauseous and decided to alert all of us (family members) again. Then she went uncontactable. We were worried and rushed down home & she went to A&E again. Of course it turned out to be nothing. Visit A&E twice in less than a span of 8 hours!!This happens at least once a month. Sometimes it’s bad sometimes it’s not too bad but it still gives me anxiety. I am at my wits’ end. Everytime she does this some of us has to drop everything we are doing (like work!!) and rush to her immediately.I’m afraid if I ignore her, it might really be a health emergency. But if I don’t, it’s like answering to the boy who cried wolf everytime?I am also extremely angry at her for using this selfish method to seek attention(I’m assuming). We visit her more than once a week, and i have 2 other siblings who live with her too. My dad is working but is also home most of the time. She also constantly asks me/my siblings questions about her medications when we are not even doctors. I have informed her to ask her own doctor but she just likes to ask us… she will sometimes google random medications and even ask me if she can take it??? She also went to a specialist before to conduct tests and to ask why her feet swells in the morning when she wakes up. She said she was scared it might be sth serious.. even though i have reassured her that it is normal. Even after the specialist confirmed that it is normal for someone her age, she did not believe him and continued worrying about it (and also keep asking me about it to this day from time to time)!!Oh that’s just the tip of the iceberg.. pls help…..-#99392: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99392","['Like: 4 people', 'Wow: 1 person', 'Care: 1 person']",20 comments,2 shares
99390,"Have you ever have such encounter. Sometimes I thought I didnt know how to love, but then perhaps I was wrong. I know this guy for 2 years. He never say he wanted me. But yet at certain time, we can be close, we can behave as a couple, we held hand, we kissed. So that's us. I know that was wrong, everytime I wanted sometimes from him like how a normal couple would expect, like going out on special occasion, holding hand, even if we are in public. Able to cuddle in bed. He give me a ""No"" feeling. He never say he wanted me, neither does he say he didnt want a relationship. It's torturing to me falling and picking up myself each and everytime. There was a special day I wanted him to celebrate with him, we were talking some day back and I was hinting to ask him out. Eventually the conversation die off and nothing happen. I should have asked him, I know ppl would have say so, but I started to feel his unwillingness for the occasion, when eventually I was happy (just because of his presence), but I just felt, he was just appearing to be happy with me so as not to disappoint me. So on this special occasion, I kept myself occupied, but when I was left alone, I was actually crying. I was actually crying when I was walking. I told myself that he can forget about this day, which I cherish so much and wanted his presence, does it not make me realized how insignificant I am to him(ya, I know I am not important). I know I have to move on. I told myself so. But today (jus a few days later). I missed him, I seem to forget all the sorrow I had gone through, I want to be back with him. I kind of told myself I had pack up the feeling to move on, and remain as friend. But I know eventually, I will bump myself on the wall again, and felt the cycle all over again. He wouldnt always say No to me, but I felt he was just trying to keep me happy because I care for him sincerely. I really do. Now, it seem that I was a  burden to him, and make me wanne leave this ""relationship"" when yes, ultimately I wanted to care. I wanted the reciprocal feeling, I know I cant, I pick my broken pieces by myself. And now I got the feeling of being a burden.

She said we can do this medium or long term whenever we both have time. Her only caveat is her drive is high and I must be able to do multiple times in one night.

99389,"I met this girl, a year older than me, online from an app about a few months in mid-May, we texted everyday and two weeks later, she wanted to meet me physically to which I agreed. But a few hours before she our meet up, she told me that she went to meet another guy from the same app and hung out for a few hours. Initially, I was a little puzzled as to why she told me that. So after talking for a couple of hours, she told me that she liked me and to be honest, I’m not sure if that’s a red flag because we only known each other for a couple of weeks and I barely know her and she just straight up tells me she like me like ‘ok….’, of course I didn’t really know how to respond and simply said, ‘I am interest in knowing you more’So she shared freely with me her past that she did a lot of things, physical intimacy with her ex (She knew him for about 2 and a half years) and they broke up because he kept calling her derogatory names, him being super clingy and would blame her for everything that went wrong in their relationship. On the days we hang out, many times she would mention about what she did with her ex and the things he liked and what not (Again, I was a little puzzle and confused as to why she kept sharing about her ex every time). She would also make those ‘uwu/anime girl sounds’ which to me sounded quite annoying and irritating. She would get angry at me over the small things like just changing the time we meet or when I’m just like for 5 minutes, she would blame and criticize me that ‘I am someone who cannot keep track of time’ or another time where I was visiting my grandmother, I told her that I can’t attend this event with her, and she just flared up. It was just the small things she would hold grudges and resentment. For our conversations everyday, she would talk to me about her work (I’m still studying in my 2nd year so I can’t really relate much to it) and rant about her bad her work is and stuff, and I offered some of my suggestions and opinions that could possibly help her but what I got was more ranting. Initially I was okay to hear about her rant for about a week or so but to hear about someone ranting every single day for the past two months, I felt quite uncomfortable about it. I would rather talk about something much more interesting and fruitful instead of hearing all these negative stuffs everyday just felt mentally draining from schoolwork. I really tried my best to help and support her during such periods but it just seems tougher by the week.For a few moments, she would talk about our future together (Keep in mind that we only knew each other for two months) So one day, I decided to let her know that we should stay friends as I didn’t want to hype up this whole thing only to let her down eventually or keep any expectation that she had going up. Furthermore, I personally don’t think I’m ready for a relationship (which probably what she was expecting) and I want to enjoy my singlehood for the time being. At first, she was upset and just gave me a cold shoulder reaction. Thinking back, I thought her being a year older than me, would garner somewhat a more mature response or understand the situation a lot better. Eventually, after letting her know my stand that we can remain friends but going further would be up to anyone’s guess. Our conversation everyday gradually became to a stop where she would make up small talk like ‘Oh look at what I’m eating’, ‘Look at this cat so funny haha’ everyday, personally I’m not really good at small talk so I could only respond so much like ‘LOL HAHAH LMAO’ and she just complained to my close friend that I’m ghosting her when the truth was that I’m not that interested in her but rather stick as friends and it feels like she’s pushing in the boundaries beyond my comfort zone. Our conversation went like this:Her: how are you doing?Me: Doing alright having a ton of school work and projects to submit, wbu?Her: Nvrm I don’t care alreadyThe whole thing just felt bizarre and weird and I tried to ask her what’s wrong but she didn’t really say much. Basically, she just felt like I’m ghosting her and ignoring her when the truth is that I’m just simply not that interested in her and just want to live my life. I suppose different wavelengths, different frequency.But the thing I have on my mind right now is that at times I feel like she’s having traits of her ex and just straight up blaming me for the smallest things and hold some form of grudge to use it against me which I felt was abit toxic, and that she has quite a lot of unsolved emotional baggage on her end and that she’s just dumping onto me, am I in the wrong to tell her my boundaries?-#99389: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99389","['Like: 9 people', 'Haha: 2 people', 'Care: 1 person']",16 comments,3 shares

99386,Embarrassing confession here. My girlfriend told me she does not get wet when she sees me anymore and demand I take the following steps if not she will breakup with me. I am here to ask if people think I should listen to her?She wants me to lose 5kg as I have a muffin top.She wants me to go for a hair transplant as I am receding at the temples. Full head of hair otherwise though. She said it is embarrassing for her to be seen dating someone who might go bald one day.She wants me to go for plastic surgery to shave the bone around my jaw as she said my face is too wide. I actually went to see a surgeon who told me she thinks it is a bad idea as usually this sort of drastic surgery is more for people who have been in serious accidents.Overall I will say I am a slightly above average looking guy. I am not particularly good looking but there are girls who are drawn to my looks. My girlfriend on the other hand can easily be a model. She is super vain and is the sort who can spend four hours just picking the perfect lipstick colour. I am honestly quite dismayed though that she seems to be viewing me as a cosmetic product for herself too.-#99386: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99386,"['Haha: 36 people', 'Like: 24 people', 'Sad: 7 people']",69 comments,6 shares
99385,"This is a question for Prof Ben and also for everyone else with experience in relationships, especially on the financial side of things. Shoutout to Prof Ben as I believe you once mentioned that you leave all your money for your wife to handle?To give some context, I have been with my gf for 2 years. She is from a quite well-off family the kind who owns around 10 properties. My family is not well off, likely bottom ten percent of Singapore if you consider net worth. Her salary is about 3k a month and mine is around 15k a month. I am one year older than her.My gf said some things to me last week which I found quite shocking.Firstly she said she feels like dating a secondary school kid when she is dating me. She said because I often buy basic jewellery and food for her, or bubble tea which is a childish joke. She mentioned her friends' boyfriends buy expensive watches and bags for them and even her parents buy expensive makeup and perfumes for her, so she expect her boyfriend to at least be able to match what her parents can give her because that is her standard. She said instead of giving her small gifts or writing cards to her, she rather I stop being a kid, so immature, grow up and buy her expensive things. She said this is how adults date. Her friends who chose bfs or eventually husbands based on how much money they can give them, are all now very happy.Secondly, she said she is upset at me for being so poor and earning so little money. I was very surprised to hear this come out of her mouth given that I make five times her salary. She said she feels sorry for me that I cannot spend more money and feel like paying for me so often. But I know she say say only, our expenditure when dating is almost entirely paid for by me. She swipes parents' credit card even when shopping for herself. She said I am very incapable and I should reflect on why my salary is so low. She said she is unsure if she can continue dating such a low income guy like me.I countered by saying actually on 3k a month, based on her own earning abilities, her lifestyle should be on the more budget end. By saying all these, it means she wants to use my income to upgrade her own lifestyle. I asked her to clarify if this is fact. She then said that is not true, my lifestyle is too budget for her and I need to up my game to match her standard. I was so confused so I said ok long story short, you just want me to buy you expensive bags and watches is it? She said yes. Then I said did you just contradict yourself then? She said well it is ugly to say it out directly, she is giving me a chance to be a real man and gentleman and take the hint and spend on her without saying it and making everything sound not nice.She then went on to say she is unhappy that I help out my parents financially etc etc and that I cannot give her a sense of security unlike her friends' boyfriends who spend 100 percent of their salary on their gfs and then borrow or take money from their parents to cover their own living costs. I countered by saying isn't that leeching off the older generation? She scoffed and said that is called the power of a family, the power of a community. I know nothing about all these because I am from humble backgrounds and this is how the real world works.I must admit I was super shocked to hear all of these. The only hint I ever got before this that she thinks this way was that she is always telling me about her friends' successful golddigging attempts and how happy they are.Do you people think any of her points are valid?It sounds so messed up to me but she said everything so convincingly and matter of factly that I am not so sure anymore.-#99385: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99385","['Sad: 11 people', 'Haha: 8 people', 'Like: 5 people']",43 comments,14 shares

99364,"[In serious need of advice]Before anyone judge me too harshly, I just want to put it out there - also for those who are in the workforce and unfamiliar with the university landscape now. University is stressful and for many who have a part-time job to fund our high university fees and are unable to cope with the workload, ghostwriters have been the solution. There are so many ghostwriters on platforms such as Carousell. I found a highly-rated ghostwriter business who is a Singapore Registered Business. Hired their service for a project and it was satisfactory. Hence, as I was stressed out juggling with the workload from many modules, I decided to hire their service once more for my online exams. In the end, the online exams were outsourced and badly done - answers were found on google and not paraphrased at all. I failed the exams and were marked for plaglarism with disclpinary consequences. As much as I am at fault for hiring someone to take my online exam for me, I feel that the business should take responsibility too. I am writing to seek your opinions and thoughts on whether I should publish a full review publicly online (with screenshots and details) to prevent other students from potentially falling for the same thing with them. Currently, the business has a perfectly clean record on Carousell. I'm sure the business will never allow me to publish my negative review there so I am thinking of a public online blog post of sort.-#99364: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99364",['No Reactions'],0 Comments,0 Shares

99362,"I am from SoC, going into Year 3 this semester, and seriously considering withdrawing from my course and going into a private school.For some background, I am a PR, did quite well for my high school exam, and had no interest in any course when I was applying to NUS, so with heavy family influence and based on my score, I chose BZA.Ever since the start of Year 2, I realized I have 0 interest in my major, so every semester became extreme torture especially group projects where you cannot afford to not put in the effort because of your teammates.I consider myself a creative person – I like painting, writing, playing music, just any of the creative fields in general. And I do think I have some inherent talent in it, I scored distinctions in my O-Level Higher Art as well as my IBDP High Level Art, topped the cohort. Programming is actually very far removed from my identity.So I don't feel a shred of motivation to continue my remaining 2 years, most likely I may fail a module here and there, and all of this is causing me an insane amount of stress and anxiety, especially when my parents want me to continue and get that degree. I also have a past medical history of a mental health issue and this got a lot worse recently and is affecting my studies especially given the situation from Covid.I do have my plan if I do drop out – I got to know of this private school called 3dsense in Singapore. Apparently, they rank #10 overall in 3D art schools in the world, and #3 in motion graphics and design. I was surprised that such a high-ranking school in 3D art existed in the country. Their requirements for admission is primarily passion, and some portfolio to prove that you do have some aptitude in any creative field.I am under Tuition Grant, so out of the 8 semesters of subsidized fees, I have already used up 4 in NUS. So if I quit, I have 4 remaining( roughly 2 years). But luckily 3dsense offers Tuition Grant and is only 12 months diploma course.Considering all these, my heart says that I want to quit and go into the scene where I would really enjoy what I am learning, but I am extremely afraid not of the social stigma I would receive from not having a university degree but from my parents, as they put in so much money and effort in my education and who are expecting me to get a degree from NUS.What would you do in my situation, in all honesty?-#99362: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99362",['No Reactions'],0 Comments,0 Shares

99349,"Yes, there is a Korean cult (not shincheonji) that has been actively recruiting NUS students throughout the years under a fake student group.I was approached by NUS seniors during open day at one of those booths they put up at central library area. They were giving out freebies like NUS pens and notebooks for people who signed up.They used a personality test called “Art Diagram Therapy” and paired you up with a senior or some kind of career coach. We were asked to draw shapes and they could somewhat say something about your personality (I was a freshie and a sucker for such things). I remember that some of them were not alumni of NUS and boasted that they had affiliations with other schools like NTU and SMU.I was with my friends so they split us up to do the consultation for the “Art Diagram Therapy”. It was done one-to-one (without the presence of the group of friends that were with me).The senior doing the consultation asked me about my interests and whether I had a purpose in life. I was told that I need to raise my level through religion and that they offered Bible mentorship which could be done anywhere on campus or according to my convenience.I met them several times at UTown and other parts of campus. They were nice and cheerful. Then I got invited to a concert at an industrial unit at Ubi Ave 1 Level 3 near Macpherson MRT. Turns out that most of the people who were manning the booth at NUS were from this “church”.After attending a few sessions of their so-called bible mentorship which introduced content like “three division, body-soul-spirit, miracle of sun-stop and parables”, I went to google the content and found that they are most likely from a Korean cult called “Providence”. Ghosted them after that but I was so freaked out and disgusted because most of their members seemed really young (I think some of them looked like they were from secondary school or JC.)Now that there are people speaking up about them, I think it’s important that all the people that were approached by them continue to provide information so that we can guard against such activities in the future.Perhaps NUS should be on high alert with regards to these matters.

99343,"My wife is pregnant in her first trimester, and she is currently unvaccinated. Before labelling her as “anti-social” as part of the unvaccinated population, let me explain why. There is no evidence or studies that vaccination will not cause long term deformity or harm to the development of the baby. Firstly, there is no insurance by the government or any institutions that if few years down the road, it is proven that vaccinations cause development problems to the baby.  What recourse does the parents in seeking physical or monetary compensations from the pharmaceutical companies or the government in pushing out vaccinations for pregnant women? According to CDC, pregnant women should be vaccinated because studies did not show there is an increased risk for miscarriage. How about long-term risk to the baby well-being, what does studies say about such risk? Our gynaecologist does not recommend my wife for vaccination for this reason. The government does not outright states vaccination is okay for pregnant women but to consult with your gynaecologist. The responsibility still lies with the parents to assess the risk. Secondly, even if there is support by the government for any negative side effects. Parents and the baby will endure the consequences for the next 70 years. The effects of any negative side effects will be with the person from baby to adulthood. The person can only endure it for the rest of his life. Can the child blame the mother for taking the vaccination? As stated by the gynaecologist, “If the baby turns out blind or has deformed limbs, is it worth it?”After weighing the risk involved, it is safe to assume that most pregnant women will stay unvaccinated till more conclusive evidence of risk of vaccinations on pregnant women or breast-feeding mothers. Pregnant women already have a hard time dealing with morning sickness and emotional mood-swings. Let us not simply label pregnant women as part of the “unvaccinated population”. So long as they continue to safe distancing measures, let us not “pressure” pregnant women to vaccinate.-#99343: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99343",['Like: 6 people'],0 Comments,0 Shares
99337,"I would like some advise please, I am evergreen and have little to no experience with relationships in general.So I have been working with this girl for a while as part of some project. We have been working together for a while now, but because of the COVID situation, we never managed to get together as a team and really know each other. I am also rather quiet and find it hard to put myself out there. But recently, I kind of realised/caught feelings for her, seeing her in a meeting for the project a while back. I realised that she embodied everything I wanted out of a relationship. We seem to get along fine during meetings and general banter. So I am definitely pursuing this however and by whatever means necessary, but I find myself unsure of how to handle this situation appropriately.Now comes the part where I need advice. I really like her and really want to pursue her. However, since we work together in the same team, and now that I have taken up a leadership position within the project, I don't want to play on this possible power dynamic and make things awkward for her. Also, I don't want to draw a mental connection between me and ""work"", as I really want to get to know her at a more personal level, and if not to get together with her, be close friends rather than just as parallel lines drawn together by the common goal of the project, to part once again as and when I leave. So there is this as one stumbling block that I have to overcome.Secondly, she is a freshman into university and living in hall. So I am also a bit concerned that she would be whisked away by some Prince Charming while I might never get the chance to take the shot. The other thing is that she is incredibly busy in University already right off the bat, so I can't find much time to really ask her out (which she agreed to previously but didn't manage to confirm because Phase 2). Meanwhile I am already in Year 3 and looking towards adult life, the workplace and something long term, which I am willing to wait for her. I am sure she is single at this point (miraculously), but I don't really know how I can ask her about her and my single status in a more casual setting and let it sit in her mind. I also don't know how to get her to ""like me back"" in the romantic sense, as I have never ever even swooned my dog, much less the girl of my dreams.I have decided to do my best to try and arrange sometime to go out with her for at least the next 3 months, and then if it doesn't pan out well, I will decisively just ask and pose the question. If it then doesn't go as I wish, I would do my best to stifle all romantic emotion involved and reset as platonic friends. Furthermore, as we are still working together in this project, I greatly value her contributions in that sense as well, and don't want to make things awkward between us.As such, how should I proceed in this situation?-#99337: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99337",['Like: 1 person'],0 Comments,0 Shares

99324,"To vaccinate or not?Your vaccination is not merely a personal decision but a SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.Yes, fully vaccinated individuals can still be infected but is much less likely to be infected. (https://www.imperial.ac.uk/.../coronavirus-infections.../) Are we not responsible for how our action or INACTION affects another person? Our “personal” action or decision (if we can label it as such), in this case, to be vaccinated or not, should not warrant a different treatment, provided it does not have any repercussion on the majority of the population who also resides in this country. Personal inconvenience of the unvaccinated is not reason to justify endangering the greater public. This is no different from the designated smoking corners to prevent the inhalation of second-hand smoke for the majority who do not smoke.In the hypothetical scenario that a later research study convincingly proves that vaccinated individuals are equally likely to be infected and hence subsequently infect others, only then can we start debating if this differentiated treatment should be done away with.Any adult who consciously choose not to be vaccinated in spite of the above should be required to make an official declaration and relinquish ALL subsidies to their healthcare treatment or quarantine requirements resultant of covid-19. They should also be least prioritized if a shortage of hospital beds becomes an issue as we have observed and continue to observe in many other countries. (https://www.straitstimes.com/.../hospitals-in-malaysia...)Why should tax payers pay more for the healthcare needs of selfish individuals who consciously choose not to be protected? We have limited resources and many needs. Assuming the role of a policy maker, I can choose to allocate the resources that would have been used on the unvaccinated ICU patients for other patients and their medical needs, and who are ill by no fault of their own!Why is a critically ill covid-infected adult who has chosen to unvaccinated more important than say my elderly grandma from the pioneer generation who has had a heart attack?For those who are still reading, I guess this is an analogy that summarizes the whole argument at hand.Let's assume the premise of a military unit in a period of conflict. As a commander, I have ensured that every soldier is issued a set of protective gear, helmets, armour plates, FAD etc (I.e. the vaccine). I have also provided the training for the proper fire movement to maximise your chances of survival (I.e. the proper hygiene routine, safe distancing and contact tracing).Then we have a soldier, let's call him Soldier M. Soldier M has access to all of the above but does not want to put on his helmet and armour plates nor practice the correct fire movement during an actual battle. His says ""wear helmet also not full protection, proper fire movement also still can get shot"" (just like how some argued that the vaccine is not 100% effective). And... its uncomfortable and inconvenient.In the unfortunate event that soldier M is shot and wounded in battle. Is it just soldier M who's paying the dues for his poor and selfish decisions? His section and comrades who were relying on him will inadvertently be compromised. (Just like how the family, colleagues and community will be affected by an infected individual) His comrade, let's call him soldier L, soldier L who was relying him for cover fire is now at greater danger, albeit exercising his personal responsibility to be properly equipped and exercising all the correct procedure based on their training. And yet another soldier will need to casevac soldier M, further reducing the number of soldiers on the frontline.Let's assume in the event that both soldier M and soldier L were severely injured in battle. We have 1 medic and enough medical resources to only save 1 of them. Who would you prioritize? The selfish soldier M who became a burden to his comrades because he was unwilling to bear with a little inconvenience? I say let the selfish bugger bleed out to his death.-L-#99324: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99324","['Haha: 2 people', 'Like: 1 person']",2 comments,1 share

The team is no doubt very capable, however cant help but feel that the culture is discriminatory towards non chinese speaking employees.

She has many grandchildren (more than 20). When i was a kid, my mom said she did not want to take care of me/my siblings but chose to take care of my other cousins. My mom had to quit her job and take care of us full time. Not sure why, but probably cause my dad was not the favourite son. It was pretty obvious that the other son was her favourite.As i grew up, my grandma has never asked me about my school or grades or anything at all. Basically we never talked. Even when i visit her I don’t remember having any conversation with her. I would usually greet her and ask her how is she, but that’s it. She has been this way towards me and all my siblings. All these while, she took in some of my cousins and raised them (they stayed at her place on weekdays, and went back to their parent’s place on the weekends).Writing up all the above, i feel sad. But that’s just how it is.I got married last year, and although she was unwell, she attended my ROM. I have not seen her since then due to covid restrictions etc. To be honest, i was happy about the covid restrictions so I don’t need to waste time to visit her only just out of obligation, not even love.My parents did visit her regularly and they mentioned she asked about me. She also gave her regards to me. This happened multiple times throughout the year. (It has never happened before).Suddenly i feel a little guilty for not visiting her. Of course a small part of me wishes to have a loving grandma while growing up and all, but it’s too late for that. I still resent her for how she treated my family (she also did not treat my parents well). Should i visit her (and it will just be awkward and silent) or should I just ignore this and move on with my life?-#99311: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99311","['Like: 1 person', 'Sad: 1 person']",0 Comments,1 comment

And he is the kindest, gentlest person I know of and I felt like he didnt deserve to die so young cos of some stupid disease. Why him of all people? Please everyone, cherish the people you love. Choose love over hate. It was particularly tough for me because I fought with him over the stupidest things because of my insecurities when he was the only one who truly cared. I wish I wasnt such an idiot for doing what i did to him and i cant forgive myself for this.

99299,"Will you consider her as a true friend? During our schooling days, we always hang up together, we did a lot of fun stuffs together like drinking till midnight, singing k and shopping. Basically what youngsters will do. We enjoy each other accompany and we call each other as best friend. But sometimes I felt that is just one-sided. Usually, when she is down, I will be the one there for her right away without hesitation. For just a call away. She is always the one telling me all her problems and I am always the listener and the one taking care of her. When I needed her accompany, I can feel that she has tried her best to be there. But sometimes she just told me she busy with her bf and stuffs and I felt quite annoyed. She can tell me that she is afraid her bf will get angry if she not with him and what so ever. We quarrel sometimes because I felt that I am just taken for granted. She just took me as an accompany rather than a friend. I am attached too but I am able to juggle the time between bf and friend. I don’t know why she is unable to do that? So she is afraid of her bf who have overpowered her? Or is simply I am not so important like her bf..Okay to cut it short to years after. We become busy working adults. I still try to find time to catch up with her, now she said she married and busy with kids. However, she kept telling me she do not take me for granted and she appreciate the friendship. To add on, on and off during Covid period is even harder to meet and dine in together. I still try to connect by sending her gifts and stuffs. There’s isn’t anything in return from her. I know sending gifts you don’t have to expect anything in return but sooner you still felt you are unappreciated. I felt that I am like a fool really. Maybe she still holding on to the friendship because she is gaining something from me? She don’t even put in effort in birthday gift too and I still gave her expensive birthday gift and putting in effort. I know you guys will said nah she is not forcing me to do that. I am just stupid to do all the great things for her. Because deep down.. I really appreciate and like her as a friend and I want to keep her. But how she is like that, I really don’t know should I continue the friendship or not? People did told me that there’s such people who can be quite insensitive towards other feeling.

99296,"Hi, I'm trying to make new friends who have the similar interests as me. COVID hit hard and having to stay at home made me feel so lonely and depressed. What made it worse was this made me bottle up my feelings even more and that caused frustration to my closest friends and we have since lost contact because they felt like I do not trust them. However, it is not the case but I just find it hard to open up. And so I felt even more alone. My family does not know about such feelings too as I no longer share with them since they don't know how to deal with it, and they too are not having an easy time.Sad things aside, I've recently been trying to pick myself back up one step at a time, and food is something that never fails to brighten my mood. I'm a big foodie and I'm all about cafe-hopping. I love trying out different cuisines, new food trends and doing food reviews too! I also love to take aesthetic pictures and hiking out in nature.If there is anyone who is an introvert like me but also felt the same as me during COVID, let's be friends!-#99296: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99296",['No Reactions'],0 Comments,0 Shares

99294,"I'm not sure if anyone relates to me but I'm frustrated of people trying to persuade me to date because of my age. I'm turning 25 and my parents keep nagging at me to find a girlfriend despite the fact that I've expressed that I'm not looking for one. I am still recovering from the wounds of my past relationship of 2 years (it was my first relationship), but I did not tell my parents about her before our break up because I wanted to introduce her only after I was sure she was the one. Without knowing this, after I turned 20, my parents would tell me the same thing every year as I grow older to be nicer to the girls around me and that it will be harder to find a partner after I graduate. I get that there is this sense of societal pressure to get married and that they might want their own grandchildren, but is it so wrong that I want to focus on building myself first before finding a partner? I just feel that I am not mature enough  and have not gotten over my previous relationship to find a new girlfriend (I know I'm a hopeless romantic, as it has been nearly 5 years but I cannot forget her). I don't want to hurt someone else and not be able to give my all to that person. My mindset is if it comes, it comes. If it doesn't I'm fine with staying single, because at least I can take care of my parents when they grow older. It just annoys me when people will try to set me up with other girls intentionally, encourage me to use dating apps on top of the continuous nagging from my parents.Anyone has advice how to deal with this and how to explain to their parents/people around them?

99303,"To all the girls, if you read this, I hope you won’t be like me – a woman who unintentionally destroyed a good man’s career, motivation, and confidence.It all started 3 years ago when he was in Australia studying for his final year of bachelor degree, while I already graduated and started my job. If I were to evaluate him now, I would rate him at least 9/10. He never cheated on me, he never once talked about or praised other girls in front of me, he was extremely focused on his studies and was a good example to his fellow course mates and younger siblings, his hobbies were mostly about self-improvement, career advancement, and learning new skills, which can be boring to most people, he would have Skype video call with me a few times a week when we were in LDR, and he was a caring boyfriend too. However sometimes things in life just didn’t happen in the way it should have happened. Back then he was just maybe 4 or 5 out of 10 to me, because I failed to appreciate him, and thus destroying both our relationship and his career.Just like any other girls, I get jealous too, but it’s not because my ex was very good-looking or attractive to other girls, but because of 2 things, first is he was being too helpful to the point where his female course mates would study with him, second is he treats everyone very nice, and I felt that as his girlfriend, he should treat me much better instead. So due to these reasons, we fought quite a number of times, despite being together for close to 3 years. He is also a person who doesn’t know how to defend himself or use the most appropriate words or sentences to explain himself, so during our fights, I was always the winner. And also I tend to go against his interest like programming and coding, because at that time I thought it was useless, why not just focus on your studies and be an expert in your own field, instead of wasting your time on something else that you might not even need in your future career, so we also fought about it, especially during some weekends where we visited each other’s place, and he just spent hours to learn those computing stuff. I mean it wasn’t actually that bad, but at that point of time I was already quite pissed with his interest, so seeing him spending so much time on it just got on my nerve even more.Although he only had to be in Perth for a year, I felt that it was actually quite long, especially back then I was still a pretty needy girlfriend, so eventually I started to be more suspicious, more jealous, and more insecure too. As usual, we would fight, but it was all because of my silly and unreasonable factors, like he added new female friends on facebook, and I went crazy and asked why he added them or accepted their friend request, and some are even angmohs. He did explain to me that the reason was because of group work, and it was easier to communicate and share information among group members through social media. Before our worst fight happened, this incident whereby his plan to return to Sg for a winter break was ceased. He decided to attend a workshop that he was interested in, and it only happened once a year during the winter break, and so he had to give up his flight back to Sg. I later found out that it was actually a web development course that costs a few hundred bucks. I totally went all crazy since I already disliked his interest in computing, and now he gave up on coming back to Sg just to waste his time to attend this rubbish course.The last straw came after a big misunderstanding. Now as I recall it again, it wasn’t actually a fight, it was just me being a big idiot. As we were having a video call, he told me that he was heading to bed after we finish talking, and I literally thought he would go to bed like he always did, but a few days later when I was scrolling through facebook, I saw his friends posts on another friend’s birthday celebration, and I saw him in those pictures and videos too, which he didn’t mention to me at all. After that, I took quite some time to compose a very long message to breakup with him. Right after sending him that message, I blocked him wherever possible where there was no way he could reach me. Some of our mutual friends tried to contact me too, but I thought they are much closer to each other, so they will help him cover up his lies, so I ignored them too. I went through a hard time by myself because I don’t have many close friends.After he returned to Sg, he came to my place to look for me to explain to me, but there was nothing that I could do about it because I was already attached to my then-fiancé. During his explanation, he said he was really going to bed, but that night was the birthday and farewell of another exchange student, and his friends were celebrating at their dorm and invited him too, so he just went down for a short while to say goodbye to him, and then went back to bed. He didn’t know that he had to share with me such 5-10 min activity that wasn’t so important. Regarding his winter course, it was actually a rare opportunity because some of the speakers were famous profs from ivy league like MIT, Harvard, cal-tech, and he said it is very rare to have such course in Sg, that’s why he chose to stay back instead of returning to Sg. At that time, I was already attached, so even if his explanations were valid, I could no longer accept him.It was only in the recent months I found out that my actions have severely impacted his life. He was an excellent student, but because of me, he failed to focus on his final sem, and did very badly in his final exam though he still passed. He previously wanted to study an MBA and CFA too, but little did I know that he had stopped pursuing his dream. With his resume and degree, he can easily find a decent job with around $3-4k as a fresh grad, but from what I heard from our mutual friends, he is doing a $2k+ job that only requires a diploma. Honestly I’m not that close to our mutual friends too because of that incident, but they did say the breakup had significantly caused who he is today. Although we have stopped talking, my friend actually passed me a hefty red packet on his behalf during my wedding solemnization. Knowing how little he earns, I felt bad to receive it, but I still did receive it as his form of blessing. I honestly have no idea whether he has any future plans, but apparently he has been working for the same low-pay position in same company for two years with little to no opportunity to progress.If you ask me, will I be with him again if I wasn’t attached, the answer will always be yes. Right now there is nothing I could do to rebuilt his confidence and motivation to pursue his dream anymore. I’m married, and I can only devote to my husband, but I feel deeply sorry for what I’ve done to him. If only I was mature enough to understand his situation, if only I knew he was happy doing what he enjoyed, if only I could resist the temptation to meet new guys before he returned to Sg, if only I could be more understanding to walk through difficult path with him. It only took me a few minutes to block him from reaching me, but these few minutes was what resulted in who he is today – a poor broken soul with so much potential to succeed in life. All he wanted at that point of time was just one very simple thing, which was my time to listen to his explanation, but I never gave him any chance to explain himself and ended our relationship when he was still studying overseas.So once again, to all the girls out there, if, if you ever happen to come across similar situation, please, please never be like me. Your ignorance to a guy may just be as easy as you thought, but you will never know how much of an impact on him you can make. There is no harm listening to explanation, especially when a guy is trying really hard, finding ways to reach you just to talk to you. It is easy to block a guy with just a few touches on your phone, but you will never know that you’re indirectly killing him from inside.Once again, I’m really sorry for what I did to you JL. If I could return to where we were 3 years ago, I would have listened to you, and you would have been much better than who you are today. I’m really sorry.-#99303: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99303","['Like: 104 people', 'Sad: 70 people', 'Haha: 20 people']",96 comments,112 shares

This is because the university did not prepare students with the appropriate skills to face the working world. All students should wake up from the dream of meritocracy, clinging on to childish beliefs that “hardwork in school will give me good jobs” because there are too many entitled, self-obsessed, “smart” students who expect the society to hand jobs to them on a silver platter. Schools should spend more time slapping these entitled individuals to wake them from their dream land.Nowadays employers look more at social skills, EQ, internship experiences, etc. to hire.

I always performed considerably worse than all my course mates, even though I’m taking a reduced workload for all my semesters of study.

99274,"[In serious need of advice]Before anyone judges me too harshly, I just want to put it out there - also for those who are in the workforce and unfamiliar with the university landscape now. University is stressful and for many who have a part-time job to fund our high university fees and are unable to cope with the workload, ghostwriters have been the solution. There are so many ghostwriters on platforms such as Carousell. I found a highly-rated ghostwriter business that is a Singapore Registered Business. Hired their service for a project and it was satisfactory. Hence, as I was stressed out juggling the workload from many modules, I decided to hire their service once more for my online exams. In the end, the online exams were outsourced and badly done - answers were found on google and not paraphrased at all. I failed the exams and was marked for plagiarism with disciplinary consequences. As much as I am at fault for hiring someone to take my online exam for me, I feel that the business should take responsibility too. I did pay quite a sum for the services.I am writing to seek your opinions and thoughts on whether I should publish a full review publicly online (with screenshots and details) to prevent other students from potentially falling for the same thing with them. Currently, the business has a perfectly clean record on Carousell. I'm sure the business will never allow me to publish my negative review there so I am thinking of a public online blog post of the sort.-#99274: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99274",['No Reactions'],0 Comments,0 Shares
99273,"Dear admin, i hope you won't filter my post.I have joined my current company for 2 months, holding a managerial post. After I joined, I found out that my subordinate applied for my position but she didn't get it.  Then I got to find out that she has also applied for my position 2 years ago and didn't get it as well. The best part is, her buddy (from another dept) in the company also applied for the manager position in her dept and didn't get it. So both of them bitch about how sucky the company is but they never wanna resign.Because of this, I became the ""victim"". She does not talk to me unless work-related. On a daily basis, we barely talk. Sometimes, we don't even talk for days. She do her work and I do my work. I tried to be nice, I greeted her, care for her by asking how's her day but she is friendly to everyone except me. There were a couple of times I asked to do something and her response was, ""no need lah, here is like that, no need one"" or ""ya ya, I done already, all I do already"". When I asked her for help on where to find certain documents, she refuse to tell me and say she will send me the attachment. If not, she just say ""oh, it's there, in the folder there, you go and search"".I asked my fellow colleague, another manager, for help. He suggested me to ""buy her in"" with food and whatsoever. So I tried, but doesn't seem to work as well (maybe I only bought her once or twice). And it is not in me to do this. Why should I buy her in? Isn't it ""default"" to have some basic professionalism and team work in your daily work?My partner suggested ""top-down"" approach. If there's anything she refuse to do, just tell her that I am her boss and she has to do. This is not me to do this either. I just wanna do my work and have good teamwork to improve work processes and deliver good service to our customers.My boss is aware of what's happening cause that's what happened to my predecessor. I have recently spoken to my boss on my subordinate's contract renewal cause she is approaching 67 and my boss said he's happy to renew her. My world simply crashed!

I have left my previous 2 jobs due to human relations issues (one played out by boss and one verbally abused by boss) and because of this, I am seeing counsellor now.

99272,"Seeking advise to help for my husbandI am a 33 years old working mum of 2 son, 4 and 2 years old. My husband is 30 this year but he is very lazy.I met my husband through a common friend 5 years back when he just returned from studies in the UK. We hit off pretty well as he's witty and humorous plus he secured a very good career in an MNC company and decent family. I'm comfortable with him taking the lead and planning for everything so I usually don't have any inputs for his decision despite him always asking me for it.I got my legs swept off by him and agreed to marry him after 1.5 years of relationship. But things start to change much after marriage. He became very lazy whenever I asked him to do stuffs. Like when I asked him many times to get a driving license, he said that he never actually needed one as he has someone to chauffeur him around and taking PHV or cab is cheaper than owning a car in Singapore unlike UK. I was pretty upset when he said that as a car would be convenient for checkups for my gynae visits and meeting up with my friends. He does not help out much in housework except for washing of clothes, windows cleaning and fans as there are much more things to do apart from these. He will usually lounge around or sneak off to go for exercise once he is completed with those chores while I need to look after the kids. I told him there are many other chores to do but he always said that he will do later but never did.His working hours are pretty hectic as he will usually reached office by 8.30am and will only reached home by 8pm. As I finished work earlier, I will usually picked up my kids from childcare and buy dinner, which is quite tiring when my cab doesn't arrived on time or when the food delivery doesn't come early and need to tend to hungry kids. Travelling can be pretty tiring even via taxis. I always tell him to cab home but he likes to travel by MRT as it helps to save cost. Cabbing home can reduce an hr of travelling time which he can help me to tend to kids when i'm tired and he's earning a high 6 digit figure per annual, I can't figure out why he is so petty on money when I'm only earning  1/3 of his salary. Although he pays for all the cab rides and food but I just want him to share the load of actual parenting. I felt so overwhelm by the fatigue that I actually quit my job to take care of the kids when my 2nd kid was born. I told my husband that he should spent more time to take care of the household but he often use work or a need to exercise as an excuse. I don't understand why he needs to choose timing to go for exercise. For weekdays, he has free time from 11pm onwards, but he can choose to go straight after work. For weekends, it's even worse, he can opt for timing like 1 to 3pm where the kids are usually sleeping or 10pm onwards but he choose timing like 6am in the morning or 5pm in the evening when the kids are awake or going to be awake.Things start to have a strange turn of events when he mentioned that he wants to quit his job and spend time. I felt very happy and relieve when he said that. But the downside is that, he told me that I may have to look for a job as he could have difficulty finding a job that has work life balance and decent salary. I was happy and disappointed at the same time, but I guess that's life. So I agreed and he quit his job and he's taking care of the kids at home while I went back to the workforce after 2 years of being a housewife. Things are doing great for me as the workplace is good and the pay is much higher than my previous job, but not for my husband. He has difficulty finding a manager entry level job as he is over qualified, having armed with an Imperial College degree and INSEAD MBA, he has difficulty finding a job that support work life balance and decent salary when he is willing to take up to a 75% pay cut. Despite being at home, I find that the status of the house cleanlines is not up to my standard when I can find small peck of dust on the window grill when I do my spot check and he still has the tired feel when he doesn't even need to work. I don't understand why can't he take care of the house when I'm earning the dough. When confronted, he said that he is making pretty good money while being a day trader and suggested that we should get a maid to do the menial work while both of us earn the money but I don't like strangers to stay with us. I also urged him to be more active on job hunting as we have expenses to pay for. I need his contributions for my parent housing loan and our utility and my cab expenses. Luckily our 5 room is fully paid thanks to his investment. He's pretty lazy as his day trading can fetch about 5k for good months and 3k for bad month and has a emergency savings for 10 years without working, but it can be embarrasing for a guy to be unemployed for long time.I asked my friends for advise but their responds are pretty mixed and I'm also dried up for solutions, which is why I would like to sought for more options to get my husband to help out more.-#99272: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99272","['Haha: 134 people', 'Like: 60 people', 'Angry: 36 people']",331 comments,199 shares

99270,"Hi, earlier on I saw a post about a guy looking for someone to BTO with for purely investment purposes. I’m looking for the exact same thing as well. I am 26, have been working for a year since graduation and earning 5.2k pm. I come from a single parent family and my dad is working overseas long term and I barely see him. Since young, I have lived with my aunt’s family but she told me due to some circumstances, she will need to sell her current house in a few years time. I am very sure I am not intending to get married nor is there any family pressure to do so. I have always wanted to get a property but I can’t afford private and have to wait 10 years to get a resale flat. Hence, I am looking for a single female to BTO with. We will not have any relationship, intimacy etc, just as partners to buy BTO. Any age is ok with me as long as we meet the income criteria and can live harmoniously as housemates. My plan as follows:- Get a new 5 room BTO, we split the cost equally - each of us take one room, rent out the other 2- After 5 years MOP, sell and we split the profit- get another new 5 room and repeat the process - After we sell the 2nd flat, we can split off- I could probably afford a private property by thenWe would thus live as housemates for 10 years+. Would any girls be interested?-#99270: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99270","['Haha: 98 people', 'Like: 70 people', 'Wow: 13 people']",117 comments,24 shares
99269,"In my current final semester of study (25 this year), I've finally been diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive) and everything clicks, like why I am just always trailing behind my fellow coursemates. I've been taking 16MC every semester, delaying my graduation, but still having lousy results. Everytime I get my results and see Bs and Cs, I just sigh to myself. Despite all the effort I put in (or try to due to my condition), it just doesn't ever seem like enough. Of course, this just discourages me from attending lessons, which doesn't help me improve at all. I've also had a semester where I had to take LOA due to my depression crippling me. It's under control now, but it's scary to think what it could do to me.Everyone also tells me that in uni, you get to meet a lot of new people but I have yet to make 1 friend. Now that I'm graduating, the feeling of being alone is just overwhelming. Being on multiple dating apps to find a partner is also extremely difficult, despite taking the advice of my other (few but close) friends. I would consider myself average looking, so it could be my height (1.68), or maybe its the vibe I'm giving off? I don't know anymore. It would be nice if I could just find someone, maybe through an introduction, who can connect with me. I'm not really desperate? But I am afraid that I would just die alone.I'm not really sure what I want out of uni, but it hasn't gone as smoothly as I hoped it would.

99263,"Hi guys, I recently rented a place from Dec 2020-Aug 2021. I moved in with another girl. This girl I said with was quite untidy and had been staying in the house for 2.5 yrs. On handover the owner was super pissed and deducted 70% of the deposit to which I mentioned I got the place in that condition and due to urgency I took and have the pics from when I moved in. The problem is when I moved in that condo the agent mentioned to this girl(main tenant) that no need to add my name in existing contract rather he'll send her a template where in I have a room rental with her. When I asked for my deposit back as my room is in same condition (infact cleanliness miles better than how I got) agent sees you need to get it from her. She gave me only the amount that she got from the owner which is not equivalent to how much I paid as deposit and she literally ran away in grab until I could get message of how much I received. She was also arguing with me on how I owe her coz I stayed there for 8 months. I texted her that I need my full amount as the agent and owner both mentioned they have no complaints with me she started saying she doesn't have money and I need to wait until she gets our pub deposit back but to be frank how can I trust her when she literally ran away. If money was issue she could have given me a date by which she can give it to me simple.

99250,"Dear Prof Ben , I have accepted both an offer from NUS to study Humanities and Sciences ( major in chemistry )  and an offer to study Chemistry in University of Oxford . My parents were very supportive and proud that I got accepted to go UK and it’s my dream to study in University of Oxford. However I am in a dilemma now .  Last week , I overheard my dad telling my mum that it will cost around $500k (Tuition fees + living expenses + flights etc ) for a 4 year course and he is not at all sure because I am not studying a specialised course such as medicine which “guarantees”  a certain income level so long I do not screw up along the way. My mum was on the other end fighting to let me go because she knows it’s my interest to study chemistry and she believes I will get to learn from the best in the University of Oxford and she does not mind slogging more years to earn back the money . My parents do not require me to pay them back the money.  Neither do they want me to apply for bonded scholarship for fear that I miss out on greater opportunities after graduation .I really need all your advice . Assuming I become a scientist / researcher or a University professor , how many years will it take for me to save up $500k to return my parents because I feel really bad here . I don’t mind working hard to return them before I start saving for myself . I am happy with simple life , no branded goods , simple dining , public transport , public housing etc so Long I get to study what I like and be a scientist . My dream is to invent things that can improve the lives of people , doesn’t matter if I am not as well paid .  If I cannot find a girlfriend because I cannot pay for her lifestyle , I rather be single also . Or should I consider what my dad say ? Ie. If I am studying a general degree , just stay in Singapore and I will do just fine without incurring such a huge debt . I also want to say that I do not wish to study medicine just because I am more likely to earn bigger bucks.  I want to be happy in life doing what I like and having a purpose in life everyday when I go to work ,even if it means earning lesser money . My friend watched The Big Bang Theory where a smart researcher earns lesser than his not so smart girlfriend who works in pharmaceutical sales , and mock me at my decision . However ,  I am very certain what I want to do because to me ,happiness is not money and owning things . But I feel very bad if I can’t earn enough to return my parents and my mom has to delay her retirement plans because of me . My mum is 52 and my dad is 58 already . My sister is in 2nd year poly and she may have to go overseas if she can’t qualify for local U.  What should I do ..? Should I just stay in Singapore NUS ( humanities and sciences) or should I follow my heart and go University of Oxford ?-#99250: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99250","['Like: 113 people', 'Care: 28 people']",175 comments,41 shares

We are each other’s first partner, I’m born with a golden spoon and his family requires financial assistance. Initially I was attracted to him because of how he pays attention to me, takes care of me and would plan little surprises etc etc but now that we’re at the 7 years mark, everything’s gone. I mean we still love each other, but I think it’s evolving into another kind of love… like family? Anyways recently I can’t help but to compare him to guys around me, because everyone seems so smart, polished and driven while he’s always treating me like a mum and walking encyclopedia, asking me for advices etc. I don’t know how much longer do I have to wait for him to grow up and become a man. I love him, I love his kindness but at the same time I’m running out of patience. Also, I’m worried that he might have a change of heart when he enters the “society”, when he meets new people etc. By then I would’ve lost almost 8-9 years of my youth. Side note: my dad wants me to get married asap while his dad told him to take his time and build his career first.

99421,"#99421: In Nus, I struggled significantly with my mental health due to a couple of episodes where my physical health was compromised. I fainted a couple of times and these events led to severe panic attacks. This harrowing experience ,that lasted for four years, taught me key and valuable lessons that I hope others can relate to and maybe adopt for themselves. Caveat: What I write is genuinely what I went through and made sense for me but the lifestyles and personalities of everyone else is varied and so if it does not make sense for you, there is no need to adopt it. 1) Learn to find what exactly you enjoy about being in university rather than only seeing it as a burden to complete or seeing it as a perpetual rat race. University is not only a time to excel grades-wise, but it is also a time to build yourself and your personality. Constantly being worried about grades, beauty, relationships and money will only lead to you being depressed and unhappy, while suppressing your genuine inner personality. It is when you shift your mindset to making yourself happy and finding ( people, events, places, activities) to discover who you are, will you have the confidence and develop that bright spark to achieve the rest. I find that 90 percent of the time, it was the reverse where people were drowning in insecurities and compromising what they would genuinely want, in order to achieve what they think they must have. ( ie. Everyone is doing A and so i must do A, even if I dont actually want to or feel ready for it )  Sure at the end of four years, you may have got that first class honours or you may have achieved a certain financial target. Question is: Do you feel proud or just relieved that you made it? If its relief, then you still struggle with an insecurity and base your self-worth on this. It will come to a point where you have made so many compromises to achieve what you think you must have, that you end up being bitter and possibly shallow. For me, because I was impacted by my circumstances, I really had to create environments that would make me happy and help me to feel safe. This led to me joining everything under the sun - from pilates, to dance, astronomy, social dancing and going out of my way to talk to exchange students. I decided to explore my interests, in spite of my grades taking a downward spiral and my self-confidence deteriorating. I found that I actually discovered so much more and it led to me actually figuring out what i wanted to major in and eventually,I turned my grades around so by the time i hit my honours year, I scored straight A's. This is not to say Im less bitter or shallow, its just that I was more at peace with my journey than others who seemed to despise the journey and associated their time in uni as highly stressful and competitive.2) Your intelligence is not tied to your grades. Read this again. okay and again. Read this as many times as you need so you can internalise it. okay now let's try another one: You can be intelligent even if you have poor grades. Having entered university from the JC, and having been in a competitive cca for more than 10 years - I firmly believed the only good and valuable thing about me was my grades. Then uni hit and that went down the drain. Then I realised, there were people I met who understood different things about life that honestly made them intelligent. One knew and deeply understood people, so she knew how to navigate relationships. Emotional intelligence is so important and when you go out into the working world, you will realise that it is this trait combined with confidence that helps you to thrive. There was another who was entrepreneurial and knew where to find the lobang and how to create the lobang. May not have been perfect with the theories or the essays but she could spot opportunities and knew how to cash them. One was a perfectly gifted orator with many unconventional ideas - led to her writing a CV that got her into a top consulting firm despite average grades. There are so many other forms of intelligence and if you can train yourself to start looking away from grades as the almighty one, you may realise that the world is much bigger and has more depth. This is not to say grades are not important- it is but not to the extent we as a society has priced them to be. Overall, I hope this helps and I wish all of you the best in the paths you take and lifes you choose to lead","['Like: 121 people', 'Care: 12 people', 'Love: 11 people']",11 comments,41 shares

99395,"#99395: TLDR; I recently found out my boyfriend of 3 years paid for sex (prostitutes) when he was younger and question his values because he introduced the world of prostitutes to his married brother.This is gonna be REALLY long, but I'm seeking for advice on my situation. I have a boyfriend of 3 years and he really loves me (vice versa). He will always put my needs before him and is faithful during the span of our relationship. However, I recently found out about something he did when he was in his early 20s that makes me question him/our relationship. To elaborate on what happened, he was young and single (and kind of desperate) back then, so he paid for prostitutes to satisfy his needs. I understand from his standpoint because they have their needs, and his only outlet then was paying for sex. I guess it's the same idea as people having one-night stand and the only difference is he paid for it so I'm actually not judging his promiscuous lifestyle back then since it was before he met me. But what made me angry/sad was his selfishness of not letting me know when we first started this relationship, and instead only telling me 3 years down our relationship (read along the lines of potentially contracting STDs). Yes, he got himself checked and he is clear (but what if the hypothetical 0.000001% chance he was not?). I personally feel that he is really selfish for not letting me know and he could at least let me know out of respect at the start of our relationship. Whether or not I want to commit to this relationship even after he disclose his past is my choice. What he told me was, he really cherishes our relationship, and he is scared that I will leave him after he tells me the truth (especially since it's the beginning of the relationship and stakes were still pretty low). I thought it was really selfish of him to do that. Because it's really a fact right now that I'm 3 years invested in this relationship and the stakes are so high that I can't just walk away. I felt really angry because I FELT (personal opinion) he got exactly what he wanted and I'm really playing in the palm of his hand. Disclaimer, he is faithful to me and treats me really well now. He isn't cheating on me or visited prostitutes during our relationship. But I can't help but feel anger towards his selfishness.I know what some of you might say, let the past be the past. He isn't obliged to tell me, and a lot of guys actually have similar past but they don't usually tell their other half to ""protect"" the relationship, etc. So yes, I acknowledge that and I really appreciate him telling me the truth. But there's more to this story than the above, which made me question him/his values.Timeline: this was also during his early 20s when he was living his best life as described above. He has a brother who is very much older than him. Back then his bro was married to his wife (not sure how long they were married for, but they were together for at least 10 years). I am also not sure how the marriage spiralled, but there was once my bf and his bro went for a drink and his bro told him about how there might be something going on between him and his MARRIED female colleague. At that point in time when his bro told him, the cheating hasn't happened YET. But what really irked me was my bf's suggestion/advice to his bro. He told his bro something along the lines of ""if you're just itching, I have contacts for prostitutes. But DON'T ever start a relationship with your female colleague. She is married ffs"" (paraphrased). When he told me this, my mind was blown because he clearly thinks it's less of an issue when it comes to physical cheating vs emotional cheating (disclaimer: I get it that some people think physical and emotional cheating are different things altogether, but what I'm trying to drive at is that I PERSONALLY am against both physical and emotional cheating, hence the idea is more about my bf and my personal values are not aligned). He said in his defense, he currently thinks both physical and emotional cheating are equally bad. He was young and pretty drunk and he is aware now that his values were questionable back then. Anyway, his bro eventually cheated physically AND emotionally and the marriage broke apart. After introducing his bro to the world of prostitutes, his bro engage in such services frequently (after he and his wife divorced). Let's talk about temptation. Recently my bf and his bro were casually eating (and drinking) along the streets of Geylang, and his bro was itching. So he told my bf he's gonna find prostitute, and HAD THE AUDACITY to ask my bf if he wanted to go as well. Mind you, his bro is 100% aware of my existence and we literally hangout together (as a trio). I'm talking about going out for meals and even travelling together as a trio. More than anything, I really lost ALL respect for his bro and I simply do not want to have any interaction with him EVER. In my bf's defense (once again), he didn't agree to it/didn't cheat on me and was waiting outside the chicken coop instead. He also said his bro could be just joking when he asked him if he wanted to come along. Like if my bf were to agree to it, his bro would most probably question him if he was serious. But hey, this is a mystery we'll never unravel. My bf is all about giving his bro the benefit of doubt, but they are family after all, so you will surely side family no? Doesn't matter to me, I simply lost all respect for his bro as a person because he's got really questionable morals (to me, not my bf). It really got me thinking about how it's a vicious cycle of temptations. Back then he introduced his bro to the world of prostitutes and unknowingly enabled his ""physical"" cheating ways. Right now it circled back such that his bro could possibly and easily enable my bf to cheat, so my bf could possibly be more prone to cheating. I know I sound really paranoid and pathetic, but I really can't help thinking in this 0 to 100 way because my logical state of mind is failing me. I don't know how/what to think about this and I really need some advice/enlightenment (his selfishness, potential temptations, etc.) I'm also finding it really difficult to reconcile with the whole physical vs emotional cheating theory he mentioned back then. Although he regretted what he said, it still makes me question his innate values. It just kind of planted this seed of insecurity/doubt in me such that in the future if he ever itches, he can simply go about his philandering ways? Although he isn't cheating on me today, but what if he cheats on me a year later? 3 years later? 10 years later? The stakes are only going to get higher as time goes by. He says he won't cheat, but all guys say the same bs. I'm just thinking in the future, will I ever look back at my stupid self today for seeing the red flags but not acting on it by leaving this relationship just because he hasn't cheated YET. P.s. appreciate if you can give me some tips to deal with his bro in case we are ever forced to be in the same setting because I'm not going into the whole ""if your bro and I drop into the sea, who will you save first"" rabbit hole.

But a few hours before she our meet up, she told me that she went to meet another guy from the same app and hung out for a few hours. Initially, I was a little puzzled as to why she told me that. So after talking for a couple of hours, she told me that she liked me and to be honest, I’m not sure if that’s a red flag because we only known each other for a couple of weeks and I barely know her and she just straight up tells me she like me like ‘ok….’, of course I didn’t really know how to respond and simply said, ‘I am interest in knowing you more’So she shared freely with me her past that she did a lot of things, physical intimacy with her ex (She knew him for about 2 and a half years) and they broke up because he kept calling her derogatory names, him being super clingy and would blame her for everything that went wrong in their relationship. On the days we hang out, many times she would mention about what she did with her ex and the things he liked and what not (Again, I was a little puzzle and confused as to why she kept sharing about her ex every time). She would also make those ‘uwu/anime girl sounds’ which to me sounded quite annoying and irritating. She would get angry at me over the small things like just changing the time we meet or when I’m just like for 5 minutes, she would blame and criticize me that ‘I am someone who cannot keep track of time’ or another time where I was visiting my grandmother, I told her that I can’t attend this event with her, and she just flared up. It was just the small things she would hold grudges and resentment. For our conversations everyday, she would talk to me about her work (I’m still studying in my 2nd year so I can’t really relate much to it) and rant about her bad her work is and stuff, and I offered some of my suggestions and opinions that could possibly help her but what I got was more ranting. Initially I was okay to hear about her rant for about a week or so but to hear about someone ranting every single day for the past two months, I felt quite uncomfortable about it. I would rather talk about something much more interesting and fruitful instead of hearing all these negative stuffs everyday just felt mentally draining from schoolwork. I really tried my best to help and support her during such periods but it just seems tougher by the week.For a few moments, she would talk about our future together (Keep in mind that we only knew each other for two months) So one day, I decided to let her know that we should stay friends as I didn’t want to hype up this whole thing only to let her down eventually or keep any expectation that she had going up. Furthermore, I personally don’t think I’m ready for a relationship (which probably what she was expecting) and I want to enjoy my singlehood for the time being. At first, she was upset and just gave me a cold shoulder reaction. Thinking back, I thought her being a year older than me, would garner somewhat a more mature response or understand the situation a lot better. Eventually, after letting her know my stand that we can remain friends but going further would be up to anyone’s guess. Our conversation everyday gradually became to a stop where she would make up small talk like ‘Oh look at what I’m eating’, ‘Look at this cat so funny haha’ everyday, personally I’m not really good at small talk so I could only respond so much like ‘LOL HAHAH LMAO’ and she just complained to my close friend that I’m ghosting her when the truth was that I’m not that interested in her but rather stick as friends and it feels like she’s pushing in the boundaries beyond my comfort zone. Our conversation went like this:Her: how are you doing?Me: Doing alright having a ton of school work and projects to submit, wbu?Her: Nvrm I don’t care alreadyThe whole thing just felt bizarre and weird and I tried to ask her what’s wrong but she didn’t really say much. Basically, she just felt like I’m ghosting her and ignoring her when the truth is that I’m just simply not that interested in her and just want to live my life. I suppose different wavelengths, different frequency.But the thing I have on my mind right now is that at times I feel like she’s having traits of her ex and just straight up blaming me for the smallest things and hold some form of grudge to use it against me which I felt was abit toxic, and that she has quite a lot of unsolved emotional baggage on her end and that she’s just dumping onto me, am I in the wrong to tell her my boundaries?","['Like: 30 people', 'Care: 9 people', 'Haha: 7 people']",42 comments,12 shares

99227,"Sharing this to all ladies who are in the same situation as me. BF and I have been together for a couple of years and are going to collect the keys to our flat soon. That said, I have been feeling some regret about making it all the way here with this guy. From the outside, he is a pretty above average guy but deep down I am beginning to realise his selfishness or some would say stinginess? He has a pretty stable career and earns above average but whenever it comes to us, everything is about money. You might think prudence is good but there comes a point when prudence turns into self centeredness (if theres such a word?). For example, when it comes to eating out many places are deemed too expensive or not worth for him. I am not talking about high end restaurants but your usual outlets in the malls. Taking grab on very hot days is also ""expensive"".  In short, everything is expensive as long as he does not like it. For things that he likes ( cameras, watches, food that he likes etc) then those things are "" worth it"". He acts like a beggar with me but has many watches close to the 5 digit range for EACH watch. The last straw came when he wanted to use COVID to skip having a decent wedding reception. Of course i have to agree to let him save face but deep down I am seriously questioning if i should just forgo the flat and spend the remaining years of my life with someone more normal. And yes, he also thinks wedding rings, wedding expenses and all that are useless. When budgeting for the upcoming renovation he only wants to spend minimally to the point where the home looks like a joke. My point is whenever he does not see meaning in something, it is a waste of money regardless of how others feel about it. Before you guys bash me, let me tell you that he is not poor by any means at all which is why I feel like I am not asking for the moon here. I understand the importance of spending within your means and saving money but I also have a life to live. Ladies, what will you do if you were me?

99226,"Disclaimer: Long post ahead. Apologies for any grammatical errors. I remember clearly on that day when my school counsellor told me that I might be experiencing major depressive disorder. She referred me to get some help from a professional. I was only 17 back then. I couldnt get the help that I needed. Why? Financially, I couldnt even afford for a consultation back then. Social support? Funny you should ask. My parents were the main cause of it. They dont believe in childhood trauma neither do they believe in mental health status. Friends? My JC friends...I cant even label them as friends since I left the clique during prelims. ""I think you are just being too sensitive"". ""Lets not talk about it. It makes the mood dark"". ""Think positive, your parents still love you"". Those were the comments I received everytime I tried to talk to them about my problems and mental health. Ironically, I only talk about it 3 to 4 times throughout the time I know them but it sounded like I was complaining and ranting everyday. Because of my sensitiveness, I ended up getting excluded in certain conversations and activities. I realised that they probably create another group without me inside with the reason ""Ohhh we know you are a very sensitve person. Plus, we talk a lot of things that you didnt know about it. Thats why"". That was it. We had a few more fights to the point where I felt my depression clouded my judgement. Thats why I decided to leave my JC clique. We ended on good terms before I leave. I apologised profusely to them saying that its all my fault that things had turn the way it is. I apologised to them for being sensitive and I apologised to them that I had to receive counselling every week after school due to my depression that i couldnt join their activities. I realised I was at fault too. At the end of the day, it has always been my fault. Thats how I was brought up at home where everything has always been my fault. No one but only me. I was suffering. I was yelling desperately for help badly. But no one was there. No one could hear me. I felt alone. Helpless. Having this silent battle everyday that is slowly eating me up. As time goes by, I can feel that Im slowly losing this battle. Suicide? That word seems to be no longer foreign to me. Should I just jump down the building? Should i get drug overdose so that i could die peacefully in sleep? Should i hang myself? Should i purposely walk across the road so that I could get hit by the truck? I weigh my options everyday. While others woke up and were worrying about their A levels, I woke up, trying to think on how to end my life. I wasnt doing well academically anyways so A levels is probably the last thing I had on my mind. I didnt study for any of the papers. Right after my last paper, I decided that I should end everything. I felt really tired. I felt exhausted. For all I know, I have always been getting blamed at for everything. Let this be the last blame I will received towards the end of my life. I sent a suicide text to my best friend and thought this could be it. I can finally be free. I can finally get rid of this horrible illness of depression that has been killing me slowly for the past few years. A single text save my life. My best friend wrote ""I love you and I need you. If you need someone to talk to or just be there with you and spend time, you are always welcome to my house. I promise that I wont leave you alone"". Those were some of the texts I received. I realised that there is still someone out there who cares about me. I had given some thoughts over the past few years and I realised it wasnt cause I was being overly sensitive. Its probably cause I didnt had chemistry with my JC clique right from the start and that was how our relationship had strained from time to time. It took me some time for me to accept and realised it wasnt my fault. It was nobody's fault. The situation just wasnt favourable. Fast forward a few years later.... as ironic as my background situation, I am currently in NUS Nursing. Im pursuing a course where I had to do lots of giving. The only reason why I am in this course was because I wanted to give everything I could to people who need it. I really didnt want others to go through the same thing that I had went through. The only thing that went through my mind when I applied for this course was ""My mental health and heart is almost broken and its clinging on a cliff. I should give everything I could (my heart and my care) to someone else before its finally fully broken"". I thought I had recovered after a few years fighting with it only to realised that I am not completely recovered from my depression. It didnt go away. It just stays on with me. One day, I was on the way home from my clinical attachment at night. As I looked down at a canal near my house, I started to question myself, ""How long can I last? How much more can I give before I am left with nothing?"" I can feel the end is near for me but I am unsure of the time I am left with. Its a miracle that I could last this long. Maybe my best friend didnt really saved my life after all. Her actions..... had made me delayed my suicide instead. To people who are reading this, if you know someone who is struggling with depression, please tell them that you love them from time to time. They dont need your solutions. They dont need you to fully understand them because you are not in their shoe. All they need is acknowledgement of their struggles. And that is something....... that i couldnt get all this while.-#99226: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99226","['Like: 92 people', 'Care: 92 people']",30 comments,19 shares

99275,"Saw a few post here related to certain religious groups which are allegedly affiliated to a Korean cult and would also like to share my experience when I was an undergrad. I was invited by my not-so-close JC friend to join a religious group when I first started out in school. I didn't have many friends so I thought to myself, why not join this group to make more friends? The members seem very friendly at first and I really grew to like them. However, there were a few things which felt weird. Firstly, most of the members are females, and mostly in their early twenties and are quite attractive.Secondly, we were not allowed to tell anyone outside the group about the existence of the group and we had to come up with a list of reasons of what we have been up to, in case our family members asked.Thirdly, we could invite our friends to join the group but only after providing a photo of them to our group leader along with a brief background of our friend. The friends we plan to invite are also encouraged to be female, in the same age group and best if they are single. Apparently, the more friends we invite, the more powerful we can be and the more we will be rewarded in our afterlife.The last and the most alerting indicator was that the lecture materials during our sessions had very poor grammar and frequently included images with Korean origins. Sensing something was amiss, I did some research into Korean religious groups and chanced upon this group called Providence where their leader is a convicted rapist who duped the female members to have sex with him. I got cold feet about the potential shit I got myself into, and stopped attending the sessions. The leader contacted me multiple times and told me that I will be punished for leaving the group, and that I will never be able to find a boyfriend and will be single for life. Jokes on her, I got married after graduating and am expecting a boy soon.Would like to encourage students to open your eyes big big and be super cautious when dealing with religious groups. You never know whether whether a horny leader lies underneath the innocent exterior waiting to prey on their foolish followers.-#99275: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99275","['Like: 143 people', 'Wow: 26 people', 'Haha: 23 people']",41 comments,38 shares

99206,"I’m not vaccinated. (Not by choice.) I’m in the middle of another vaccination programme and have been told to finish that vaccine, wait 3-4 weeks, before getting Pfized. Just as well, because studies on the effects of mixing vaccines are incredibly rare. I haven’t been able to locate a single article on the possible effects of the commingling of Pfizer and the particular vaccine I’m currently undergoing. I intend to be vaccinated but the earliest I can do so is end of this year.My husband is also unvaxed. He has a congenital heart issue – and recent post-vaccine deaths are mostly heart related. The authorities have denied any causal links between the vaccines and deaths, citing “pre-existing conditions”, but under what circumstances, really, would a determination that death was linked to a COVID vaccine be made? My husband has been told “benefits outweigh risks”, but the fact that there are “risks” leave me unsettled. I don’t want him to take the COVID vaccine until there are reliable studies on the effect of the vaccine on persons with his condition. Again, his cardio hasn’t been able to point me to one. The point of this is, I don’t think the current dining in policy is fair. Hawker centres can be a hotbed for virus transmission – haven’t we established that with the recent spread of the KTV cluster? The “open air” vs enclosed space justification can’t take us very far. Beyond that, vaccinated persons can also be carriers of COVID. My husband and I stand a chance of contracting the virus as long as a (vaccinated) carrier eats at the same coffee shop as us, or enters the same lift as us and sneezes through a fabric mask, or if we happen to have had lunch with him/her at work. The permutations are endless. I can’t help but feel (1) unfairly penalised by the government, when allowing us to also dine in would make scarcely any difference. Surely the fact that my husband and I are still COVID free speaks to the sort of caution (and precautions!) we have exercised? And (2) the overemphasis on dining in restrictions are frankly illogical. If the government’s objective were to protect us, then the policies have got to be all-encompassing. At least start by compelling employers to let the unvaxxed work from home, until vaccinated or until positive cases decrease to negligible. That one-sided focus on dining in is incomprehensible. It’s as though the only way of contracting the virus is through dining in (???) – as if a person cannot get the virus through workplace interactions, social gatherings and such. I simply cannot understand why employers can mandate my and I to return to office, but we can’t be allowed to dine in?!

99204,"Here mostly for advice, and also partly to rant: I've been working in the healthcare sector for about 4 years since graduation, and I really want to quit my job. I can't tell if it's because I've grown lazy or if the hospital is genuinely stressing me out. I really can't recall the enthusiasm/ passion I once had in wanting to make a difference. Everyday at work just feels like a mad rush for time: patients on the list have to be cleared on top of the additional administrative tasks and miscellaneous services that we have to provide. Lunch time is almost always compromised just so we don't have to stay back too late after work. Manpower is obviously lacking but we're expected to give more and more and more - even if we try to sound out that the workload is too much to manage, we still have to accept the implemented changes because ""it is in the patients' best interest to do so"". We can't cut corners because that would be unfair to the patients, and we can't take less workload either because that would just mean more work for our colleagues - there just seems to be no feasible solution available. Some days I just really want out - I'm so sick of facing patients I don't even care if I take a pay-cut (heck, it's not even like our pay is great). To those who are still working in the public healthcare sector: Please share some tips with me on how I can love my job again?

She just blasted  ""IT IS NOT AN EXCESS SKIN, IT IS A F-ING WART""Yes, she is a doctor, so she is familiar with this kind of stuff.I am just wtf, i thought i have excalibur, turned out it is a toothpick, and worse, i have a wart?? So, the next day, we decided to straight away go to nearest GP to ask for morning after pill and remove the excess skin/wart.However as it is the National Day, all nearest clinic were closed. So we finally went to the GP that was quite far.When we were waiting for registration, my wife saw a familiar face in the GP and she just said ""F, she is my classmate""Yes, the GP is her classmate and it was kinda weird that we needed to explain the unforgettable moment that we had to a person that she knowsI could see my wife and her friend were kinda embarrassed talking about this, even though they are doctors.Though after the consultation, my wife just keep consoling me, during our journey home she just kept saying""Ur lil bro and that 'cauliflower', haha""My pride just plunged to the bottom of the ocean.Not sure whether she still love me after this.Sigh...-#99196: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99196","['Haha: 483 people', 'Like: 202 people']",238 comments,251 shares

99188,"Having lived with my grandma since young, I grew inevitably attached to her. Whenever I needed any advice or someone to talk to, I knew that I could always turn to her and she would be there for me. As I started growing older, my grandma's health started deteriorating. The past 2 years was excruciating for all of us. She was brought in and out of the hospital frequently. Her sons didn't see to care much about her wellbeing while my mum was clueless about what to do. Therefore, I felt the need to step up to look after her. I remembered that I would spend time reading up on my grandma's conditions to find ways to help her. A condition she had was dementia and it was painful to see her slowly forgetting about me. She started thinking I was one of her sons and I felt disappointed that she would think that her unfilial son would be looking after her like I did. However, I slowly realized that what was most important was that she was blissed. Even though I would spend time with her to keep her mind active, I felt that I wasn't doing enough. I felt that if only I had spent more time with her then her dementia wouldn't have progressed  so quickly. A year later, covid happened. My grandma was unwell again and I thought it was unwise to send her to the hospital, thus, I decided to call a housecall doctor I found online to visit her. I regretted that decision badly as she got a stroke a few days later, which I felt was due to the dubious injection the housecall doctor had given her. I googled and found out that this doctor had been suspended in the past for disregarding medical guidelines. Although there were no evidence that proved his injection caused the stroke, I felt immense guilt nonetheless. My grandma lost the ability to move one side of her body and I felt that it was all my fault. However, the doctor said that with intense therapy, my grandma could regain some of her functioning again. I felt hopeful and kept encouraging my grandma to exercise. I even tried engaging home occupational therapists in hopes that she would get better. Unfortunately, she didn't get better. In fact, her functioning got worse over time. She became bed bounded, she was asleep most of the time, and she started eating and drinking less as well. In the weeks before she passed, she couldn't swallow her food properly, she couldn't speak, and she could barely keep awake. Despite all that, she would still put a big smile on her face whenever she sees familiar people at her bedside. Soon, she couldn't even eat and struggled to breathe before she inevitably passed on. As I looked at her death certificate and see the words "" passed away peacefully"", I thought to myself, did she really passed away peacefully? I always thought that I would just wake up one day to find my grandma motionless. To me, that was my fantasy of a peaceful death. Nobody ever told me that witnesssing the death of a loved one would be so painful. I was feeling so helpless when I see my grandma's vitals getting weaker everyday, knowing very well that her imminent death was coming. And as she gasped her final breathe, I heaved a sigh of relief as I know her suffering had ended. As I stood beside my grandfather at my grandma's casket, I asked my grandfather to pen down any last words he has for her. With his limited knowledge of English, I saw him struggled to write these words.... ""I LOVE YOU"". It was then that I felt a sharp pain in my heart. And as I'm writing this at 3am in the morning, I think to myself, how will I ever move on from this loss?-#99188: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99188","['Care: 220 people', 'Like: 99 people', 'Sad: 87 people']",24 comments,24 shares

99184,"Tdlr: how do you stop toxic behaviour from depressed people?I have a good friend who I’ve known for a couple of years now. 2 years ago she went through some major life changes and long story short she was diagnosed with depression. When she came out to me, I was shocked but also glad that she trusted me with this piece of news. After all, that put me in a position to support her emotionally. I went to read up a lot online about how to help and support. Initially things were still the same for the first three months after she told me. But I slowly started to see a change in her behaviour. Every time we argued over something small or when she did something wrong she’d blame it on her mental state. She also started using more and more emotional blackmail, saying things like “oh isit because I’m depressed, that’s why you said.. (something unrelated)?”, etc. honestly i think she’s the most self-conscious about her depression and she feels like the world judges her for it, but none of us do.There was this incident where she owed me some money (I offered to pay for her textbooks first in coop) and when I chased her back for it, she exploded and said “why you keep rushing me for money? are you trying to make me more depressed?” Which made me really scared because it felt like she was super on the edge and me chasing back my money would be the last push. Needless to say, I never got my money back and I just let it go.Presently I’m one of her few friends left because a lot of her friends couldn’t tahan this change in her personality and her victim-mentality. She thinks the world is against her. I really want to be very patient with her but when I hang out with her I feel a bit stressed and anxious, as if I’m treading on thin ice and I don’t know when is the next time she will use her mental health as a weapon to attack my actions. Normally the first instinct is to talk to her right? I’ve tried that but she’s get soooo defensive it’s a bit pointless. To give an example, after one of her friends cut ties with her over her behaviour, she ranted to me and I tried to use that opportunity to tell her “yaa that friend is quite bad for cutting you off like that but XX I think maybe  need to tone down a bit when you’re...” she blew up at me right after and more emotional blackmailing started again. I really feel like cutting ties with her too because this is giving me anxiety but at the same time I don’t want her to be without emotional support and helpless. You get what I mean?Whisperers, if I need to confront to her again, please advice me on how I should approach a depressed person regarding toxic behaviour? Or how should I help her and myself at the same time? I’m open to criticisms too if you see that I’m not handling something well from my texts above.

99180,"I'm a young father/husband with a 1 year old son. Life was good until my mother-in-law stays with us for more than 6 months taking care of the kid/family/housework. She literally dominates all aspects of our lives, primary because both my wife and I are newbies to parenthood and housework, and she is also kind of a perfectionist.I got scolded multiple times in a day for small little things (sometimes my wife also get scolded). It was out of love initially, because she cares the good habits of her son-in-law. But it becomes somewhat despise or hateful. I even have the feeling that she hates me/my family (except the kid)/my condo/everything.30+ years in my whole life, I never felt as unconfident and unmotivated as of now. I tried to escape by going to the office to work, locking myself in the home office even doing nothing.For small problems, it may be more bearable as I can comfort myself by telling myself that these are just small issues, I can adopt and try to make it work to her standard.However, for big problems that cannot solve easily, such as my spine/neck issue and weight loss, I really cannot bear the frequent complaints. Though I've lost 12kg in weight(3kg more till the targeted weight), I don't hear any encouragements or positive feedbacks. Most of my life is filled with positive feedbacks and I keep the self-esteem  throughout. Now, it's been really damaging.Meeting her expectations is already a super challenging job, I don't have enough energies taking care of other things. Luckily my wife is not that demanding. However, she is like a mini version of my mother-in-law, with strong expectations, just that she is a bit more positive. I find myself becoming someone with ""pleasing personality"", which is no good in the long run.My mother-in-law used to be a very happy and content lady, but not sure what has changed. Probably the following:1. COVID is adding anxiety for her.2. It's really tiring taking care of baby and the young family.3. We've stayed a bit too long together and there are weaknesses which she didn't spot before staying with me/the family.4. She has got menopausal syndrome.Anyone encountered similar issues and any suggestions on how to solve the relationship problems?-#99180: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99180","['Like: 21 people', 'Care: 8 people']",36 comments,2 shares

If your SO started following micro influencers months after your relationship had became official, is that something to be wary of?My bf and i are together for a year and i always assumed that we have a strong r/s, sharing with each other how our day went every day and any trouble we faced etc. Recently, i realised my boyfriend following count has increased by 20+ even though he has not met anyone new over the last few months. When i looked into his following list, i realised he has been following many asian micro influencers ~5-70k followers who poses in sexy swimwear or tight fitting photos. Some even had their instagram account set as private. It came as quite a shock to me as he often expressed his displeasure towards influencers who exposes their body for fame and money so i did not expect him to be following them, much less liking their photos. As those models have really voluminous body, i felt a new sense of insecurity as i am the exact opposite of them. The fact that he had always reassured me on how big boobs and big butts are not his type, his actions of following and liking their photos goes against his words. Furthermore, i realised he has only started following the models 3 months ago. I tried asking him about it but he brushed it off saying they are just photos he see online and since he only likes them and does not comment on it and won’t ever meet them, there’s no reason for me to be sensitive or worried about. Im not sure if this is happening because im not good enough for him and does not meet his standards, hence he resorted to following influencers? My male friends and brothers were never interested  in these model influencers and definitely not the least bit interested in liking and following other girls online once they got into a relationship.

How is this still a thing?How are woman still being cultured to see men as the dominant provider? Media displays of equality and feminism have progressed so much in the recent decade, I would think girls have grown to expect an even split on the bill; not expect the male to still pay for everything. Girls that do that now seem to come from a place of Machiavellian than sincerity.On my recent date, when the bill came, I paused to see if she would grab her wallet -- nope, nothing.

But as a part of the CS, cannot run away from the broken appraisal system but it is really unfair for some colleagues, whether positive or negative. Many young ones quit because of this, along with other factors like unreasonable expectations from students, parents, school management, the Ministry and country. I have officers who are mentally unwell because of the extent that they care for their students and no one cares for them other than persuading them to take NPL or to leave service. What can we do to help so that our kids can have teachers who really care for them and not have the system bleed out these exceptional ones and retain the vases?-#99140: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99140","['Like: 52 people', 'Love: 7 people']",39 comments,29 shares

He came along and accepted me. I don't have much feelings for him, but I said yes when we got together. But in doing so, he would now share that burden with me. All these while, i was talking to this guy whom i never knew i had feelings for, mainly because he was in a relationship too. We got close, he confessed his love for me and he subsequently dumped his girlfriend to be with me(just when i started my rs with my bf) . He understood the burden i had to carry and was willing to accept me too. The only difference between him and my bf is, i genuinely loves him, and i see ourselves together. But i feel responsible for ruining my bf's life. Please help me. I dont know what to do.

99137,"Just wondering if there are any legal repercussions if I leave a detailed bad review for a certain business in a forum page? I am thinking of going into the details, but will not share screenshots of our text message exchange because I think this infringes PDPA laws (or... is this allowed?). This individual has a very bad temperament and is so full of himself. I am quite afraid of what actions he will take against me e.g. suing me, claiming that this is defamation. I leave bad reviews for other businesses on their Google business page, but this business has no Google business page.This business/individual used expletives on me, and used my weaknesses to confront me e.g. ""No wonder you ... (weakness) because your character is like that"". The interactions were overall very rude, unprofessional, unethical and overboard. I am very taken aback by this event. I have no way to leave a bad review for this business as it does not have a Google page (smart of him, he may have treated others this rude but others could not leave bad reviews). The only testimonials available (of course, positive ones only) were on his website. I really want to enlighten people on his real personality because he was very popular, seeing how he is able to pick clients and be this rude without caring about his reputation. Many engaged him after reading his blog posts which were honestly thought-intriguing. He prides himself for being straightforward, but unfortunately, he is just outright rude.

99121,"Hi all, a person who is lost in direction.My bf (27) and I (28) started our relationship about a year ago. He started off being all lovey dovey, sweet, sincere, talking to me about our future as months went by and constantly telling me he loves me and would love to work hard for our future so we can get married and stay together in our own home. At that time, my heart was trying to make sure this particular person is not just sweet talking, but really work hard to build the future with me. And that is when I told myself he is the right guy, as long as we are both going towards the same direction. When we started off, he would want to meet every day, even though it would be a short meet up but it’s all worth it as long as we get to see each other and spend some quality time together. He was WFO, while I was WFH, thus, his days were long and exhausting.I started WFO and he started WFH this year during Phase 2 HA. This time, I felt like things have changed. He doesn’t meet me daily now, we do not spend time together, we could just meet once a week for a dinner or go for a half-day date. During the weekdays, when I got back home from work, he would be sleeping and wakes up when I’m about to sleep…. I offered to drop by his place, or asked him out for dinner, or just to see him for a few hours, but he always tells me “you should go home and rest”, “we can spend time doing things online”. But 7/10 times he told me he falls asleep right after dinner and disappeared for at least 1 to 2 hours. I had no choice, I became suspicious, overthinking, and starting to doubt him. There was one day, I found out that he was lying to me about him sleeping, instead, he went for a jog with another female friend, for 2 hours. When I confronted him why he lied, he said he felt “tired and annoyed” that I am always asking him why he is sleeping after working hours, and he just want to get everything out of his mind at that point. He clarified that he didn’t tell me he went for a jog to avoid us starting to argue. I asked if his love for me has changed, but he said nothing changed. I feel that the reasoning is just unacceptable. Is this what we call love? Am I too clingy? Or am I just a no one to him?

I understand that most mods from y2 onwards are very competitive and selective, in which application will require an unofficial academic transcript, such as IT2900 which was announced later in the summer. I hesitated to apply because of my poor grades. Although it was stated in the email that personal statement/motivational fit would be prioritised, I wonder how much of this holds true because it's definitely easier to filter out by CAP. In the future, I have concerns in applying for competitive mods like CS3216/CS3217. I do not know much my CAP can improve from y2 onwards.

99112,"Can someone advise me? or just let me rantI am in an abusive relationship. It didn't start out this way, over the years she became abusive. When she is ""ok"", she is cheerful, funny and caring. When she is ""not ok"", she flies into a rage easily and puts all the blame on me. What I mean by all the blame; she blames me for the past, the present and the future. The past - she can be quite unforgiving. The future - again, she can be unforgiving and angry that the past would be repeated. In case you are wondering, these are stuff like unable to pick her up from work as my team lead was chasing for a summary report at 6pm. Well, she also vents her frustration on me for stuff like her manager chided her, her colleagues being unhelpful, the customers were nasty. Last year, her anger issues really took a turn for the worse and her family, mostly her brother, persuaded her to see a therapist which she reluctantly agreed.Fast forward to today, situation is only slightly better. I consulted her therapist to understand her condition better. It seems that only if my girlfriend is willing to change and embrace the therapy sessions, will the situation improve. Unfortunately, she isn't and she claims the right to be angry and vent on me as I am her boyfriend - I am supposed to love everything about her. The therapist told me to consider the relationship - whether I could see myself living with this for the next 50 years. Well, maybe I could put up with the anger episodes, threats, guilt trips...What shook me was:Therapist mentioned she has a choice - a choice to do something with her actions. Like you would see news of wife-beater - they beat their wives but not the neighbors/strangers they see on their way home. They all chose to vent on their wives.I am not sure what to feel about this.I love her very much. We have been together for 12 years, proposed to her in 2019, will be moving in to our bto next year. I do not want to give us up, but there is nothing I can do if she does not see the problem with her beliefs and actions and be willing to change.

99107,"Hi Prof Ben, I have been reading your advice to various posts in this space and am hoping you could give me some advice too. Apologies in advance for the long post and I want to state that everything here is true and has not been exaggerated. Please be mindful that there be some triggers for readers in terms of mental health. I am in my early 30s, married with a young child. My paternal family is a traditional Chinese family. By this, I mean that my cousins and I were compared constantly on all aspects of our lives. When I was younger, the focus was on academic results. I have an older sister who is the second oldest grandchild in the family. The first oldest grandchild (let's call her A) is the same age as my sister, just a few months older. And since young, A has been stellar in everything she does, topping her class and literally scoring all As, and my sister was constantly put down in anything she did. The year I took my PSLE, my sister cried infront of me and told me I better score well to give my parents 'face'. And I devoted myself to my studies. I could study from 9 am - 9 pm with just meal breaks and bath time in between. I did not know what rest was. This allowed me to score well for my PSLE and in secondary school, I consistently topped my class and never dropped out of top 15 in the whole level. I scored all As for my O levels and went to one of the top 5 JCs then. However in JC everything came crumbling down. Due to a combination of factors, I started suffering from depression and scored (in my own opinion) rather dismally for A levels. My biggest regret stemmed from not being able to enter the medicine course (besides scoring A for GP and Econs, I scored B in everything else). I felt I was a disappointment to my family but I had really tried my best to study, sometimes while crying and with some self harm episodes in between. While waiting to enter uni, I was admitted into IMH under the MHTA due to attempted suicide. After discharge, I subsequently had treatment and was fully discharged only 3 years later. In between I built up a good social support network by indulging in new hobbies that I would never have dared to try in the past. It has been 7 years since I have recovered from depression. This is not to say that I was completely 'free' from depression. I feel it is like a shadow, sometimes not present when it is very sunny, but always there. I lost the confidence I once had (I will feel fear from speaking to supervisors, when I used to be a public debator) and I was pretty sure I suffered from post-natal depression though I didn't seek a diagnosis or treatment. I also tend to overthink and overworry about everything, and struggle to speak infront of supervisors (I tend to stutter, and sometimes just go silent and let another colleague take over). Naturally, these traits haven't had a good impact on my career. After graduation, I joined a certain government agency with a mission to help the poor and disadvantaged in Singapore. However 5 years on, I am feeling stuck in my career. Despite trying my best at work, I increasingly feel left out of the team and not contributing. This is largely because I had switched departments 1.5 years ago - I was doing well in my previous department and my colleagues expected me to be promoted soon. But the promotion did not come and I was advised to switch departments to have more exposure and learn more things. I did learn more things, but I became very insecure in my own knowledge and abilities as everything I did was constantly corrected (though a colleague assured me it is normal. She too had switched from the same previous department). I feel I am not performing as well as I should and am disappointing my supervisors who initially had high expectations of me. It has come to the point I feel very lost and stuck at work daily.Why not change jobs? I considered that, but my current job's boss and colleagues are understanding of my family situation and I can take urgent leave without worrying. I am also planning for a second child within the next year and am mindful that other organizations may not be happy that a new staff would be going for ML soon. And yes, there is the fear that if I leave my current job, the new one won't be any better in terms of work life balance (which I have now) and career progression. Going back to the previous department is also not possible as it involves shift work which I cannot commit to now that I have a young child (1 year old). Also, now that I have a daughter, I inevitably feel like I should provide more for her. When I look at my friends from secondary/university, I can't help but realize that I am at the bottom of the pool. Every single one of them had been promoted at work already, or will be in at least the next year. Their incomes are at least $1K or more higher than mine, despite us being the same age. For those with children, they are able to provide a lot more for their children - in terms of sending to enrichment classes, having a car, etc. However, I struggle with my salary, unable to afford a helper (which most of my other friends have). I come home from work exhausted daily and have to take care of her then do housework before getting my own 'me' time. However, I also acknowledge that it is hard for my colleagues to get promoted - most have been working for 7-10 years and not promoted yet. For those who went up fast, a small minority really have the skills. The vast majority have relationship connections with upper bosses or are very good bootlickers. Everybody tells me that because we are in the social service field and we don't earn money for the government, we have the least budget and therefore least promotion chances. What about my husband? For all my female friends, their husbands also earn higher than them, but I earn higher than my husband as my education qualification is also higher (uni vs dip). You can say I married 'downwards'. This caused some unhappiness within my external family when we married, but I ignored them. Now that we have a precious daughter, we sometimes argue more when it comes to finances. I guess I am feeling very stuck in life currently and wondering if you have any advice for me in terms of career and life. I wonder if I am going through what is known as a mid life crisis. I am hesitant and fearful to switch jobs despite feeling unfulfilled at my current one, and feeling generally useless because despite the same number of working years, I am so behind my same aged peers in terms of career progression. I wonder if you have went through this yourself, or have any students who did, and what did you advise them?

They did a false declaration for my mum claiming she is healthy when purchasing the insurance. Usually pple with high blood pressure cannot buy an insurance due to its complication. Thats why they get nothings out of it. Is it my fault why she shouted at me? I noticed that she likes to scream & shout at me becos i m too good to bully. I endured her each time because i respect her. But this endurance became an abuse. She always did that to me.When i twisted my ankle my foot while walking in the rain . It is swollen for a month due to poor blood circulation which a stroke patient has. She forced me to go to work during that period. Her obessive behaviour is abnormal? She asked my mum to scold me for that. Is that a normal a real sibling will do that kind of cruelity to a younger sister? I really doubt her real intention. She is simply a cruel person without any empathy to a stroke patient whom trying to struggle with her new life. As everythings change over the night. Initially, i dragged my left leg to try to learn to walk. Sometimes it simply feel nothings numbness like i hv no leg. My left arm also like useless refused to work when one of my brain cell die off everythings changed. She enjoy mentally tortured me. She has obsessive 强迫症 behaviour which is a type of mentally illness. She do not provide me with morally supported at all. She is very cruel, inhuman person.-#99102: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99102","['Sad: 5 people', 'Wow: 4 people', 'Like: 3 people']",15 comments,1 share
99101,"(Pretty long post)Hey everyone. I was born and did most of my schooling in Singapore before I moved countries where I currently reside. A little back of background info, I do have underlying medical conditions and have suffered strokes.Towards the end of my high-school life, I met my now ex-girlfriend who was my first girlfriend and we were together for 3+ years. At the time being in high-school and then early uni, you don't really think of effort in relationships and kind of think it is just, ""there"". Needless to say, I was dumped and all my friends said to me that, ""we'll help you get her back"" though they were hanging out with her much more than they were hanging out with me, but I was too gullible and didn't think much of it.After this breakup and my world getting much quieter by the day, you do start to feel a little different. She would always say she would try this relationship again but, ""needed time"" only for me to hear from others that she is saying that to toy me around. I did try to kill myself several times as you psyche really gets messed up and I was in uni as well (Failed that). Due to my underlying medical conditions, my circulatory system started collapsing and my oxygen level in my blood was getting dangerously low. I would cough up blood and my eyes would always be blank red. Not blood shot but blank red, my vision was always fuzzy which necessitated surgery. Thankfully I was ok.Fast-forward a year or so after this and I started to make a new group of friends, particularly these group of girls whom I got along with rather well. The first one, let's call her girl X and I would go to parties together and always be each others' +1. I did think that she was into me because there was once I was picking her up and she was wearing a short+tight dress and unzipped to flash me and zipped back. Furthermore, a friend visiting from Singapore, girl X and I went on a mini road trip and later that evening my friend from Singapore was telling me that when I was in the bathroom, he was talking to girl X and she said she was waiting for me to ask her out. I did so a few weeks later only to be postponed weekly for which the date never happened.At this same time, I had changed degrees within uni though still within the science side of things. I was to give an old laptop to a friend of mine, let's cal her girl Y. While waiting for girl Y, just my luck that my ex-girlfriend walked past me to her new boyfriend. She still had the balls to come talk to me asking how I am etc. I really tried to me civil about it tough my left leg was spasm-ing out due to being nervous. She said bye in a rather patronising way as she went to her class and I saw the boyfriend walk off. Only to meet another girl. I did think about messaging my ex-girlfriend but I thought that there was no point, she won't believe me anyway and I left her top find this out on her own.Months later within the same year, I walked into the student room in uni only to see a guy I was in high-school with. I knew he was friends with my ex-girlfriend and I said to him that he can be friends with her but please don't talk about her infront of me. He said he had to go because he had to send her home as she had a breakup and was feeling very upset. I am much taller than this guy so I grabbed his phone and held it above him as he tried to wrestle his phone from me. His phone was ringing because she was calling and my plan was to her here to I can talk to her. She eventually came and nearly screamed when she saw me.I took her aside and we talked. All those years of me wandering in the dark and she rolled her eyes saying that it is my misinterpretation and I yelled at her and asked if she wanted me to recount exactly what happened when she went to class and her new boyfriend walked off with another girl. This ex-girlfriend stayed silent and had the look on her face because she fucked up. (At this point, I would like to apologise to the reader that this is becoming a Korean drama but there is still more)I opened the uni student room to see the guy who was going to send my ex-girlfriend home and threw his phone at him (Not sure if he caught it). A week later this same guy confronted me in uni to scold me that I was a piece of shit for talking to a poor defenseless girl that way and the he is very happy for her that she was moving on shortly after our breakup while I was being an asshole and this guy got his dates/years mixed up and slipped only to reveal that I was being cheated on the entire time in my relationship. He tried to backtrack but at that moment, I was thinking that all my friends knew but no one told me. All my friends back then were hanging out with her more because she was tapping them all. I had wanted to kick this guy down the stairs but I was too in shock. I was in severe depression yet again. This time, because you don't know who your real friends are if people you once held close to you can do this. I did try to go to those praise and worship sessions simply because I needed something to distract myself from the cold vice of depression as I've already suffered it years ago. One girl got closer to me (Call her girl Z) and we used to chat alot and go out for dinner often where I paid. Again the whole, ""When have I ever given you the hint that I like you?"" trope was used again and by this time, I've already been burned at least three times and I didn't want to argue anymore and I removed myself from girl Z. All of this happened years ago and I've now graduated from uni. I live a rather simple life with a very supportive girlfriend and we've been together for several years. I did have plans to pursue a phd but medical conditions and physical/chemical brain trauma due to all that history does take a toll on you and now I work as a private tutor. My reason for this long post is that, I see many people who are in their early 20's saying they've never had a partner, their job sucks, their partner and them often get into blows. 1) Sadly, there will always be shitty people. 2) With regards to jobs, we all have to start somewhere (I charged 10 dollars an hour when I first started). 3) The biggest thing you can do with your partner is to talk and communicate. True that there will be some who won't listen but then refer back to point 1.Thank you for reading.-#99101: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99101","['Like: 24 people', 'Care: 3 people', 'Sad: 3 people']",3 comments,4 shares

My hubby who works in government sector find it very hard to switch job to private sector- he has been working in government after uni graduated and never had private company interviewed him. He said he will need to take paycut due to difference in govt experience which he don’t want hence he stop applying job in private sector. Then when I stopped working for like 4 months this year, he kept asking me how was my interview - very anxious in me to have a job after leaving my last perm role for 5 years. Even in the past when I did not get promoted hence not much increment and was kind of underpaid he keep saying why no promotion despite having good performance rating. Then I just started a new job for 2 weeks, got 70 per pay jump to 8k now but everyday I am very stress and tired. Work without much rest or lunch 10 mins got to start my work again yet he prefers me to still work than not working. His salary is 8.5k. If I take admin job he will say huh the salary is low leh. I am really very unhappy everyday that I don’t want to play with my kids or keep doing my work even on weekend. I hope this working in weekend won’t stay long after I have managed to learn the new things in my new job. Will you still stay on to get the good salary though it’s very stress and tired or quit to look for simple low pay job?

Many other organisations have moved on to an effective wfh arrangement, but sadly not NUS. We seem to be backward on a lot of things. You roll out a circular, and expect it to take effect almost immediately. Most of us are not even keen to come back to campus, and now non-residents are required to do an ART test as well? Who's paying for the kits then? And if we refuse to return to campus because of the ART tests, does the fault lie with us? Honestly, the ART kits are not even proven 100% effective.

99086,"Hi everyone ( I hope admins do not filter this away) sorry for the long rant/post. Recently, I realise that I dislike one of my aunts and I'm not sure how I can approach this subject to my father ( the aunt is his sister). Also I think I need some opinions because I need to check that I'm not being an a** before I even consider speaking about it. I'm slightly hesitant because I understand that this is his sibling and I think I would be absolutely gutted if my child said they hated my sibling as well, but I feel like I've just.. had enough. Many things have happened for my to feel this way but I think it became more apparent in the past 3 years or so to me (and probably much earlier for my mother). My father dislikes confrontation so he usually tries to accommodate to others and my mother (who is usually more defensive) is no longer in the picture for my family. A large portion of my disdain for this aunt comes from the fact that I don't think I can trust my father to defend me and I end up becoming extremely defensive as I feel attacked by her (even if it might not be the case). The only reason I have not confronted her is out of respect for my father. If I could I would have totally gone-off on her in a rampage. In my mother's POV (or at least what I can remember), this aunt would drop off my cousin (who is just slightly older than) me at our house during the holidays. For me as a child,  it was fun because I liked playing and hanging out with her but as an adult I see my mum's frustration because my aunt would drop off my cousin without much prior notice and it happened a few times when my mum took leave to spend it with me. In a sense her leave was ""Wasted"" and as a working adult now I think I would be damn annoyed if this happened to me. For myself, I think the problems starting surfacing to me after we attended a family event 3 years ago. My aunt's second daughter had activities near my house and wanted my father to drop her off since it was nearby. I don't have an issue with this and usually am quite happy to help. However throughout the event, my aunt kept reminding her second daughter that it was ""so and so"" time and her activity was going to start soon. I paid no attention to it but was slightly annoyed. Towards the end, I left to go to the toilet and when I came out my father was standing outside with my belongings saying that we had to go. I found it odd since I was not done but complied thinking the event had already ended. I only found out when I got home that we left because of her second daughter's activity and I completely lost it and basically gave my father the silent treatment for 2 days (which is very uncommon for me as I am quite chatty). Me isolating myself in my room and locking the door means that I really don't want to talk and the fact that I did it for 2 whole days really showed how angry I was. I did talk to this him about this matter recently and he apologised as he didn't know that I was holding on to this grudge for such a long time and for a while I forgot about it. Clearly my aunt as no knowledge of this grudge I have against her and I still strongly believe that back then, if she wanted her daughter to leave for her activities she should have just called a grab or a taxi instead of forcing me to leave before I was done.Recently, due to some family issues, I am suddenly reminded of this issue and she added more reasons for me to dislike her. My grandmother was unwell for a long period of time and I had just started a short-term contract job around that time as well. Initially, I did want to help to take care since it was my grandmother and had planned to use some of my AL (which was only 7 days) and even take unpaid to do so,  but after my aunt asked me to I just.. didn't want to because the way she asked for it sounded so entitled, as if I was obligated to do it. She quoted that she exhausted her own leave and that even her daughters helped her so it would be nice if I could help as well. I understand that she's putting her kid's well-being first but It felt like she was belittling my work and no one was concerned with how I felt and how stressed I was attempting to adjust to my own new working environment + the pandemic. Recently, we were also at another family event and she (and her youngest daughter) wanted to take our transport back to their residence, which was out of the way for us. She just decided she wanted to save money on a grab and practically just got on our car without regard that it would be tiring for my family to make the detour (easily 30 minutes through and fro in total ). I requested to be dropped off first because honestly I don't think I could have controlled myself from being snarky had I joined the whole ride. There were many other issues like this as well, but these are some of the more recent ones that really made me dislike her and honestly want to cut ties with her because I feel like she's too toxic for me. I understand she cares about her children, but I don't think that caring should be at the expense of another child's well-being. And since no one would stand up for me, I often end up taking it out on my father or acting out my emotions almost immediately and have to control myself from making rude remarks. tldr am I being a b***h or is my aunt being a b***h-#99086: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99086","['Like: 2 people', 'Wow: 1 person']",0 Comments,2 comments
99085,"Been reading lots of advice from fellow professional and friends/families about mental health issues, suicide etc recently. There are great advice and perspectives shared. But people generally assume that going for counselling/therapy is the best option. It is not always the case for every person who has mental issues or struggle with their mental health. For some, the issues they deal on a daily basis (family, socio-economic, other crisis) are enough to drain them of their energy. When they finally have some free time, they would rather spend it on anything else rather than working on their mental health issues - going for counselling/therapy requires self work to be effective (not to mention the physical and mental energy to explain and walk through things during the sessions themselves). They rather spend time with their friends or by themselves doing some activities that can bring them joy, meaning or even an hour o f escape. Any some of these activities may help their mental health.There are many factors involved when someone decide to or not to go for counselling/therapy. Yes there are many people who benefitted from counselling/therapy but not everyone is going to benefit from it. Reality is talking about it may or may not help real issues people face. And maybe we should be more understanding about their decisions too. If your family member or friend does not want to go counselling/therapy, please respect their decision and try to support them as much as you can. Let me end by drawing a simple comparison to physical aliment: if your friend/family member has a fever or hurt themselves falling down but choose not to see a doctor as they rather self medicate and rest, would you force them to go to the doctor?-#99085: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99085","['Like: 22 people', 'Care: 2 people']",0 Comments,9 comments
99082,"As someone who had suffered from mental health issues when I was younger, I always felt that more could be done to bring about mental health awareness in the community. Educating students on mental health would not only help them to understand their thoughts and feelings better but also bring about awareness on the available avenues of help. Mental health issues among students is not a new phenomenon. In fact, earlier this year, it was reported that MOE and MSF were very concerned about the rise in youth suicides. It is really unfortunate that it took the death of a 13 year old boy to drive about a nationwide effort in promoting mental health. Nevertheless, I am encouraged that more people are finally talking about mental health and more measures are being taken to bring about the awareness of mental health. Having gone overseas for exchange, I have seen how freely the people in western countries talk about their mental health issues. Singapore has a long way to go before we can break the stigma associated with mental health but I believe that we are moving in the right direction. I do hope that one day, we as a nation can be open about sharing our mental health struggles with one another as well.

99078,"Hi #98964, I saw your post. After reading many people’s uninformed comments and coming from both the public and private sector, I felt the need to share with you some perspectives for you to make a more informed decision. On the first question on whether a civil service job will provide developmental opportunities and challenges, it will largely depend on which Ministry/Statutory Board you are posted to. For some of the regulatory Statutory Boards, your assessment is quite accurate as you will find yourself tied by the processes. In my first job, I seen most of the scholars in that agency counting down the days of their bond so that they can leave the organisation. On another perspective, if you are posted to economic agencies like EDB or ESG, you get the chance to meet many industry stakeholders/business owners and learn new perspectives that will be precious in your next career move. While it is true that scholars are given more opportunities, they are also expected to perform better. I have personally seen quite a few scholars being black-listed in the organisation. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that being a scholar ensures promotion and job security. It is true that you can still pivot to private sector but the rule of thumb is that you should pivot within after staying no longer than 5 years. I transited from public sector to private sector after close to 6 years and regretted not pivoting earlier. I am not sure how much you love the banking and finance role, but do a bit more homework on the opportunities to rotate to different Ministries/Statutory Boards if you are more interested in other functions in the public sector. It always helps to have some safeguards. Most importantly, I hope you remember that it does not matter even if you make a decision now and it did not turn out the way you want. Our life is a marathon not a sprint. Enjoy the process in whichever role you are in. ????-#99078: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99078",['Like: 7 people'],0 Comments,3 comments

99067,Hi guys I'm in a dilemma now.  So my bad and grandpa both got me a phone at the same time. And idk what to do with the both of them.  Let me explain. My boyfriend got me a Samsung S21 without me knowing.  He ordered it weeks before as he knew sooner or later my phone was going to break(which it eventually did). He also got an expensive screen protector and an otterbox phone cover. Was suppose to collect it from him in the next few days. He said it was an early birthday present. Fast forward to a few days later...my grandpa came ovee to my hse. He overheard my parents conversation.  They were talking about me breaking the spare phone screen.  The next day he bought a Samsung S21+ with a leather cover($78) with other accessories. He told me about it after he bought the phone. He said it was an early birthday present. So now idk what to do.  Use one and keep the other as spare(use and keep which one?)?  Or use one and sell the other? Or any other ideas? I don't really support the idea of selling items which were given to you as gift but I'm open to listen to your opinions. I really don't want to hurt both parties.

On the other hand, I work long hours but I don’t make very much. It really bothers me that most of the time he has a lot of free time.

99065,"To #99024 from your post, all you mention about is only how your brother should have reached out/changed and how much damage/grief it has caused you but you’ve never once talk about how you could have done something different or showed more care and concern.As someone who have been through suicidal thoughts and have friends who have been through similar incidents. Many times it’s the action of close ones that cause the depression. It could be as simple as a slap or even usual parent scolding (or nagging to some) that cause them not to feel loved and feel that they are a burden to the family/society. It could just be embarrassment from you sharing a personal incident from their life to your friends and relative and betrayed their trust.Tdlr: Many times its not so much about them reaching out but what you should have done to show more care and concern and just to respect their wishes instead of brushing them off. To you it might have been insignificant but to them it is significant incident that build up to their suicide-#99065: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99065","['Like: 9 people', 'Sad: 3 people']",1 comment,1 share

99063,"“Eyyyy BRO”The fist bumps, bear hugs and back thumps are quickly exchanged as we took each other in. Jibes and cheers resounded as fingers pointed at each other’s dapper new outfits. Hell yeah, everyone is looking hella fly, and packing the confidence to roll with it. Last minute ice bags were procured from 7-11, and we were imbibing ourselves on the cheap liquor soft drink mix. Sporadic screams would sound out every time a new girl joined a group, or when familiar faces identified each other. Everyone was here to have a good time, and the mood was one of excitement, cheer and anticipation.The time read 11pm on my fake rolex, and the Red Berets had just left after clearing the bridge that we are now once again gathered on. The groups of men took in the sight of scantily clad females, while the females checked out the overdressed men with similar intent. Tongues wagged as rival groups of girls critiqued the clothing choices of their competitors, while the men sized each other up. “Hell yeah, I bet we can take them, no sweat. Just look at them, and look at how many of us there are.”The testosterone steadily rose as the men increasingly intoxicated themselves while talking about how they could beat up the other groups of men and impress all the girls, all while the increasingly inebriated ladies laughed louder and more obnoxiously in a misguided attempt to express their happiness and willingness to ‘fuck the world and all the judgement coming their way’. The happy partiers got exponentially clamorous, while the rest chugged away. A few concerned frowns and shared knowing looks were exchanged between the ones designated to take care of the rest. The designated drivers shared similar resigned nods with their fellow responsibility laden caretakers.Cigarettes were shared, and even those that previously swore off smoke would puff away. Girls would gung ho try a cigarette and cough, to the laughter of the rest present. Inhibitions were lowered, and the reservations anyone had would quickly be stripped away as the hour wore on.The plastic cups and styrofoam receptacles drained fast amongst the men, and the bottles were quickly empty. The ladies would offer up their leftovers, and some mixed groups would quickly form, as an initial contact quickly enveloped the entire group to become a huge group of ‘friends all here to have fun together’. Those looking for a warm body would quickly pair up, and be lost within their own conversations, while the rest would curse their friends at dragging them into a group and leaving them with the unattractive leftovers. Some scrambled to hide their left over liquor, in the futile belief that they would return to their stash if they felt dry, but the exodus was apparent. Groups left one after the other, all determined to convene before the witching hour. The men; some strutted, some slung their arms around each other’s shoulders as they made their way over. The ladies; their arms entwined each other by the waist, linked arms, or simply held onto each other’s hands as they pulled each other through the crowd. Goddamn, the drinks were really kicking in as I felt my brain floating, and a stupid smile slowly creep over my face. The euphoria felt great, and for the briefest of moments, all was right in the world.Lines would form outside the most popular haunts, as everyone claimed to be friends of friends with a guest list, flaunt their black cards with free access, or grudgingly cough up the entrance fee. My friend laughed as I pointed out the fact that only ugly girls had to pay for entry. That stupid statement was inherently true, as gaggles of girls were ushered past the queuing men, laughing and giggling all whilst the men drank in the spectacle and set their sights. “So we ugly girls?” The men were all paying up as we hollered at the joke amongst ourselves.“Well, if you ain’t paying, then you are the product, man.”2 free drinks, the coupon read as I stuffed it into my back pocket. One last check for all my valuables as I gave myself a pat down, and we visually affirmed each other’s presence. The adrenaline rose to a crescendo as I stepped forward to the curtains separating the baggage area from the floor. The dull thump of the bass accentuated our bodies as we started feeling the music pervade our senses.  Midnight, just in time.Here we go. I grabbed the curtains and pulled it open, and with a flourish, we entered. The dark lighting and mass of bodies made it all the more packed, as the loud music forced intimacy amongst communicating persons. The music got steadily louder as we made our way over to the podium. The music was great, and the crowd was willing. We swayed, we pumped, we twisted and gestured. We yelled at each other over how great the music was, all whilst trains of girls continually snaked through the crowds, each grabbing onto the hands of the other. The men never did move around much, but the girls always seemed to be going somewhere, be it the toilet or the rear of the dance floor, or to the DJ stand or podium. The continually changing sight of different women and different body parts brushing against me was not a bad thing, I thought.My dressing was extra sharp today, and I felt no need to approach any woman. I’m the attraction, and besides, our objective today was to have a good time celebrating a buddiy’s birthday, not to hunt. We just laughed as the birthday boy continually got shot down, whilst some of the other boys effortlessly had women hanging off them. It was good fun, and the sexual tension was heavy as the partygoers visually undressed each other. Hands roamed, and tongues explored, all whilst the crowd leaned and swayed with the rhythm. The hot mess of bodies against the freezing cold of the club brought images of emperor penguins to my mind. A random fat bro awkwardly holding his drink tried to strike a conversation up with the uninterested texting girl, who simply ignored him. I shot him an apologetic look as he shrugged his shoulders.“Why the fuck are you here to text if you are not here to dance sia?!” Fat bro and me agreed and we instantly became best buddies for the night, all whilst texting girl continued staring at her glass shell encased iphone screen. There would be an occasional shove, and a bright light would flash. The bouncers would quickly yeet troublemakers out, and the crowd will form over the empty space mere moments later. Similar attempts were made as we cheered and chanted to occasional tunes. None of us were gangsters, but the chants were too electrifying for anyone to care, for it was the anthem of the night. The atmosphere was stimulating, and we rode on the waves of ecstasy.The hot girls on the podiums would rotate, and little by little, we were crowded towards the front. Before long, we were at the front, and suddenly, my buddy was pushed up. The ever loving mushroom(fungi) that he was, he was quick to drag me up as well, and all of a sudden, we were shamelessly gyrating around as the rest of the group laughed. The hot girls locked their eyes on us, and we danced with such intensity that it felt obscene. We were having too good a time, that it almost felt like the other partygoers were voyeurs. I was jolted from my merrymaking, when I felt my buddy crowding against me, and I looked over to see where a larger lady had tried to join the fun. The podium was not that big, and together with the hot girls, we tried to shove the newcomer off. She stepped off, and tried to come up again. This was a fun game for her, as she was laughing and smiling whilst her friends guffawed and encouraged her. In a last ditch attempt to regain her footing, she grabbed onto my attire with both hands, akin to a man attempting to start a fight where they scrunch their adversary’s collar. For the first time in my life, I contemplated striking a woman. The thought was quickly overcome with sense and reason, as I tried to convey my discomfort to her. My desire for her to release my clothing was falling on deaf ears, as she was happily laughing away at my requests. A few more repeat attempts, and I had no choice. I grabbed her wrists and pried her dead clammy fingers off, condemning the poor fools beneath her to a soul crushing experience as she fell back with shock and screams rose. The men cheered and laughed as back thumps were dealt out, as did the ladies who were now grabbing me and puling me and my buddy back into their warmth. All while the pulped screamed in terror. We were heroes, Ahab and Peleg who had done a great service, and we were accorded the treatment as such. The brave would blatantly rub their bodies against us, while the shy settled for quick strokes and discrete squeezes. Either way, there was no shortage of women and drinks for the rock stars of the night, and the initial guilt I felt was quickly drowned out amongst the soft flesh and gentle caresses. The night melted away into a deluge on the senses, and the next thing we knew, we were stumbling out into the dead of the morning. It was silent and dark, with hushed whispers and pools of vomit and drunk revellers. Men that had struck out stood around smoking, while the ladies that were unclaimed lay in a heap as their friends tried to rouse them. The air was stale and sticky, with the allure of the handsome men and beautiful women now a repulsive mess of smudged makeup and sweaty hair gel. It was dead quiet, but our ringing ears and hoarse throats made speech troublesome, to say the least.We bid our good byes and stumbled into our individual waiting cabs and private hires. The eye rolls of the drivers and sympathetic onlookers was quickly forgotten as I pass out in the speeding vehicle. It was a night to be remembered, and the memory will be recounted for years to come. Nonetheless, the toll it takes on the body and mind is a cost too much to bear often.Never again, I told myself.And lo and behold, my wish was granted when covid came. I dust the covers off my instagram bed time stories archive, and heave a sigh as I look back upon how different life has been since 30 years ago. My grand son has fallen asleep, while my daughter tuts at my tall tales as she changes out from her day use hazmat suit. With a sigh, I close the chapter of my untimely youth, but cannot help rue that the younger generation never had theirs.-#99063: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99063","['Like: 58 people', 'Haha: 15 people', 'Care: 6 people']",25 comments,11 shares
99062,"I'm so tired of being at home. Anyone here had to grow up with emotionally abusive parents? The kind of suffocation you can never get away from feels really overwhelming at times.I remember when i was a kid, she would always guilt trip me with the standard 'when i die already you will regret it' and 'there is no one who will treat you better than me' whenever i do not listen to her. She is the most paranoid person i have ever known. I lock my room's door before i go to bed as i do not like my parents barging into my room as and when they want and overstep their boundaries. Whenever my mother knocks on my door and I do not respond within X minutes, she would assume that I have fainted or died, and then use the duplicate set of keys to barge into my room. Being a heavy sleeper myself, i really do not understand why she has to be so paranoid when i or anyone around us do not have any history of suicide.When i was interning, there were days with OTs and sometimes after work we had dinners with colleagues. My mother would start spam calling me if i was not home by 8.30pm. After some time i started ignoring her calls as her tone made me really mentally drained. If i tell her that i am having dinner outside and will reach home slightly later, she would say things like 'so tmr no need to work? No need to sleep?' and proceed to hang up the call before i reply, only to call me again 10 minutes later. I have very minimal social life because of how controlling she is. Over time i found out that she has this sick habit of looking through my things when i am outside or when i am bathing. I have slight OCD so i do remember the way i place my things.She monitors me around the house and even checks on whether i have finished my food. I have caught her opening up my takeaway containers several time just to see how much food i have left. She tells me that i am hungry and that i should eat when i am really not hungry. Then she accuses me of lying about not being hungry. Really speechless about this.Before you trash me for being unfilial because i complained about my mother, please consider how tough and toxic it is growing up with a manipulative person. As far as i can remember, she always tells me that she does not like it when i go out and she is the happiest when i am at home. She tells everyone that she treats and understands me the best when in fact she does not. Is that not downright manipulation? Whenever i try to communicate with her about how much additional stress she was giving me because of everything she did, she does not feel that her parenting method is wrong. She even brings home amulets for me to drink because she feels that 'dirty things' are making me stressed. Since then i have given up all sorts of healthy and proper communication with her and i just have to endure till i am ready to move out on my own. My aunt had tried to talk her into being more open and letting go but it does not get to her. My father does not try to persuade her at all and even sides with her during confrontations.Thank you for listening to my rant. I find my situation so pathetic and laughable. Some days i really want to go to sleep and never wake up again so i do not have to face them.-#99062: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99062","['Care: 94 people', 'Like: 90 people']",63 comments,29 shares

99060,"Not sure about what people have been thinking about NUS staffs' salary. However, I do feel strongly that NUS HR should provide a more enticing (competitive) salary. Even though with years of experience under my belt, I was only given a monthly salary about a few hundred more than a fresh grad. Moreover, I would be graduating from a NUS masters program soon and the HR informed me that there would be no change in the salary package even with a re-contract. Isn't it weird that NUS HR is undermining their own students and also their own value by providing a salary that is way below the market perceived range? The reason the HR provided was a NUS policy stating that they would only be able to provide a 10% increment in salary if you had just left a NUS position which was anything that is less than 2 years. This kind of disregarded the efforts taken for self improvement during the gap that was mainly caused by the current Covid-19 situation. Also, a few of my friends had gotten job offers from NUS, but the salary package is so minimal that it is even lower than what they had been earning. I have known of vacancies that had been opened for an entire year simply cos the salary that is being offered is too low, wont leaving a vital position open for so long result in a detrimental effect to the entire department? The other staffs would have to take on more responsibility and beyond what they can handle, these staffs would quit as well. Granted that we are not the top level managing executives but I felt that if the operating staffs are underpaid, as soon as knowledge and experience is gained, these staffs are going to leave, this leaves NUS with only fresh and inexperienced staffs which in the long run would just result in a loss to NUS as a whole.-#99060: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99060","['Like: 12 people', 'Care: 5 people', 'Sad: 3 people']",16 comments,6 shares
99044,"Hi all, posting this here since I'm not too sure where to ask this question. My dad recently received a quarantine order that was supposed to end at 12pm. However, the person doing the exit swab for him only called near midnight saying that he's coming soon, when it is supposed to be done within the QO period. Of course my dad refused and asked him to come back the next morning, since his QO has ended and he has to work the next day. Instead of coming down to swab in the morning, MOH decided to slap my dad with another QO for another week. My dad is self employed, and while he understand and has complied fully with the QO, he is paying for the negligence of the swabber who failed to come on time. Furthermore, this could have been resolved simply by swabbing the next morning, instead of further delaying the swab test by imposing another QO. Tried calling MOH, but then learned about the difficulties others faced trying to get through any of their hotlines. I suspect that any emails will also be ignored, because what's stopping them right?What should we do about this? It seems like my dad is being forced to choose between the swabber banging on our door at midnight or having another QO. He is fully vaccinated and has complied to the QO fully, so why is he being treated like some criminal under surveillance?-#99044: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99044","['Like: 22 people', 'Sad: 13 people', 'Angry: 10 people']",36 comments,12 shares
99043,"@prof benI understand where you are coming from with regards to the rent seeking behavior of singaporeans. I myself worked hard from a lower-middle class family to become business owner recently, I am realizing the economic realities of the world we work in.The rent is controlled by people who have disproportionate resources to purchase lump sums of land and be able to build up on it. One can justify that these individuals have put in the work and organized resources/labor to achieve this and as such are rewarded for it. But now understanding how my neighbouring businesses work (we talk occasionally) I realize that a lot of the prices are due to 1. the salary expectations of the businessmen (most expect to earn at least 20-30k per month at least) 2. the rental that we pay. These two factors are the main things that determine where the prices are set. Its very easy to see that, just a 5 minute walk away from the mall we work in, the drastic difference in prices and the way things are run operationally.As such, they cut down on the prices of the labour. by pushing wages for entry level jobs to 1.7-1.9k, even though they could easily pay much more, and the government knows about this (clearly from taxes) but doesn't do anything to encourage the rise in wagesBut on the otherhand, as a business owner, I am guessing that the govt might be doing this on purpose because they recognize that if the labor force is able to pay off their housing loans quickly, and then have enough disposable income to afford a comfortable lifestyle, then guess what, based on supply and demand, the cost of living will increase, and people will be less motivated to work hard at their jobs for a sustained period. It is the pricing of houses (shelter being a basic necessity) and the tiered pricing of private housing that keeps the populace continually striving, (“its been 5 years we shuold upgrade to condo/ I hope to live in landed in 30 yrs”) and continually contributing to the economy and keeps the wheels spinning. There is a certain narrative around housing that Singaporeans have perpetuated already. With housing being one of the largest portions of spending each month for most adults, it is these narratives around housing and the social status attached to it that keeps our labor force constantly churning. Which is good for the government.Otherwise why else do we constantly hear stories of our friends accepting jobs that make us work almost 10 hours a day 6 days a week, and complain about how long the hours we work are.. but they dont/cant do anything about it (because they 'need' to work to pay for their kid's tuition or housing loan or car loan etc)I think the structure is on purpose. and housing prices arent coming down anytime soon, not in singapore at least-#99043: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99043","['Like: 58 people', 'Haha: 9 people']",24 comments,8 shares
99040,"i got to know a guy from tinder in 2018 and he seemed like a really great catch. He is a pilot flying with a budget airline, so the flights are short and he will text me throughout the day as long as he is not flying. he will also try to meet me after his flights or arrange to have a short coffee even if he might be busy that day. From the time we met, he was always upfront about being close friends with his ex-gf. However, there was once i spotted him having lunch with his ex-gf and they did not look like they were just friends. When i asked him about it, he says that it's bcos she was still into him and wants to get back together. After that, he started asking me who i was out with when i spotted him and got jealous that i was out with a male colleague for lunch. it was rather sweet, so i did not question his actions further.A few weeks later, i saw a picture of him and ex on someone's IG story (cos they were helping out to be extras on a video). i sent him the pic and commented to him that his ex is really pretty and they he should've try again with her since she still into him. He just replied ok and disappeared.For the longest time, i blamed myself for chasing him away. But i eventually found out that he has been together with his ""ex"" the whole time we were dating. He was able to meet me so freely at the beginning because she was overseas! and all that time he suddenly cancelled cos he was ""busy studying"" was actually bcos she her time was suddenly available.i am sharing this because i recently found out that i was not the only person that he has told the ""ex"" story to and dated while being with her. I met someone who said that he tried to ask her out before during the same time frame. i am sharing this because his gf seems like a really nice girl who doesn't deserve a scumbag like him. They have been together for so many years and looks like it's heading for marriage which will be a great mistake for her. i feel responsible to let her know what he has been doing behind her back. but i also feel bad if i am messing things up for them.

99036,"Why do jobs with the ""Manager"" in the title warrant such high pay? Associate Manager, BD Manager, Product Manger, Project Manager etc.Correct me if I am wrong, but these people (often) don't have domain expertise (ie hard skills) and rely on their soft skills which arguably is so easy. ie just write reports (as long as the general proposal/direction makes sense), reply emails, user outreach, ""manage"" technical people (which may include designers, artists, writers, producers, engineers, on the ground staff doing manual work etc). In this case, I am not referring to managers who are domain experts like Art Directors, Engineering Managers etc.The thing is - let these non creative and non technical managers switch jobs with technical people. The staff with hard skills will definitely be able to ace hardest task of the manager with ease, while most managers can't even do the easiest day to day job of the technical staff. Something as simple as design a logo, or maybe write a script to automate stuff; let's see how long a manager - who often earns significantly higher or at least on par with the technical staff - takes to do such a task. You can say managing people is an ""extremely difficult"" soft skill. I beg to differ. Soft skills are simply a byproduct of assimilation into your environment, and require no special effort to hone. How many people who pride themselves on their ""soft skills"" have picked up a book, or gone to a class to learn it? Place someone with little soft skills in a social environment, and they will be able to pick it up automatically. Place someone who has no hard skills in a creative, technical environment, and most likely they will be able to produce results. For those managers who actively try to learn about their domain by reading up on books and taking courses, fair enough. Or managers who actively go above and beyond to improve company culture, processes and the overall team dynamics, then sure, the manager probably deserves the high pay. But for managers who sit on their high horse and think that the title and pay makes them better than their technical staff, think again. The technical staff can replace you with a click of their fingers, it's just that they choose not to.

We did not have many common interest but the comfort of each other seemed to be enough to keep it going. After a year she started to show her true self, constantly bashing others and putting me down. Whatever I did was always wrong, and that was the same way she treated others. I started to spiral, when you're constantly told that you are wrong no matter what you do by someone you love it gets to you. Eventually I grew numb, I withdrew from my friends and family and just became a punching bag for her when she was stressed out about anything.

I agree with you that economically, it kinda make sense - match demand and supply, also as a mechanism to keep young Singaporeans in singapore because now house = home. But socially, it’s nuts. It make young people commit to possibly  biggest financial expense in life 4-5 years in advance, and let BTO drive their life timeline. What if you are not ready when the BTO is ready (and worse still, you secured a great location say Queenstown, Geylang, Bishan)? Money makes people emotional, and emotions drive less than rational decisions. And when you’re young, that 500k value is SIGNIFICANT.

99023,"Why are some Singaporeans so fixated with Joseph Schooling doing his NS?All these comments about how Joseph should be sent to Tekong makes it sound like he was trying to chao keng his way out of Tekong?! Lets be real, Olympic training is 1000x harder than any NS training. If you look at the typical training schedule of an Olympian, it is intense! And it doesn't just go on for 2 years. They do it since young and for over a decade!In my opinion, Joseph should be exempted from NS. By winning Singapore's ONLY Olympic gold medal. That in itself, should qualify as National Service.Even though he didn't perform up to expectations at this year's Olympics, so what? He has contributed more to the nation than any NS man already. Better to send him back to US to train properly for the next Olympics than waste his youth in Tekong, which will effectively kill his swimming career.-#99023: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99023",['Like: 615 people'],124 comments,63 shares
99022,"Admin pls don't filter this. I need some advice.I felt that my family always doubts me and I end up defining myself. I'm tried of doing that but sometimes it's just my reflexes. Let me give you an example. When I refill the body wash and my sister feels that ist running out too fast, she would ask me ""Is it you use too much or when you refill you never refill properly?"". I always use only 2 presses the same as I have always used. No chnage. And I'm confident that I squeezed the refill. Sometimes when the dog asks for more food after a meal, she would ask"" You give very little is it? "". I give the same amount as any other time. 3 spoons of died food with boiled ground pork and frozen vegetables. I know these things sound trivial. Most of the time I tell myself that it's a trivial and let it slide but once in a while it gets on my nerves. It's like she thinks I'm dumb and she is questioning me. She is the judge for everything. Things are only right if she thinks so. If she thinks I'm not doing a good job, she is welcomed to add on. If she thinks I'm not feeing the dog enough then be my guess. Give him more when he asks. There's no need to ask if I gave too little. Deviations happen once in a while. I have grown to be nervous around her. Anything I do can be questioned and I have to be ready to defend myself. ""Is it you never do properly? Is it you not persuasive enough? Is it you never say the right things? Is it you never do what she!/he wants?"". And the worst question I was asked was ""Is it you lying? I don't think so. What you say and the results don't match leh"". How do I get out of the last qn? If my sis alrdy thinks I'm lying then what would make her believe I'm telling the truth? This is my house too. Its stupid that I have to tipt toe around. Life is complicated. Things do happen outside of our expectations. Evetytime I defend myself. She gives me the cold shoulder for months. She ignored me for almost a year at home behind my parents, she only talks to me in front of our parents. Only these few weeks then she start talking to me in private. I really don't want to go back to the times when she ignores me. Its horrible.

99021,"I am an NUS alumna and a mother of two. Before more people start attacking the KTV culture and deeming it to be a “dirty old men's hobby that can be easily eradicated”, I think there are some points for the public to understand:The KTV is not a dirty old men's hobby. Patrons come in all shapes and sizes. Many patrons are young – army boys “walking this rite of passage”, university students, young MNC executives, etc. Patrons are not people who cannot get girls, some just feel that the commercial intimacy path is more honest and hassle-free (more on this in the next point). Patrons are not bad, sleazy people. Patrons can be your JC crush, your kind mentor, the family member you love regardless. Understanding this is important because it is an issue that must be approached with empathy. Seeing it as an unrelatable far-away dirty old men's thing does not help.KTV (alongside all other businesses in the commercial intimacy scene) is not immoral, because how else should single people get intimacy? Getting a girlfriend at all costs? Is it really ethical to start relationships for intimacy and putting all long-term considerations in the backseat? Will this lead to more heartbreaks and disillusionment? What about Tinder hook-ups? Are hook-ups moral then? Is the exchange really fair for both parties? In a commercial transaction, every unfairness is balanced out with money. Given that intimacy is a basic need in the Maslow’s hierarchy, where should guys who cannot get hook-ups go?If KTV (and all other forms of commercial intimacy) is close/relatable and not immoral, then what should we do? We should accept it. Think of it like having a gay child: the only way is to acknowledge his orientation and accept him. If you do not, he will simply keep inside his closet, and you will lose touch with him and miss opportunities to ensure his safety. There will only be less transparency, more secrets and lying and betrayal. When society fully accepts commercial intimacy, regulations and protocols to protect all parties can be implemented, and all outbreaks (of COVID-19, of STIs, of violence) can be prevented. Society will always be safer with authority-managed hostesses than with hostesses hiding underground. As a mother, I will not call for the closure of hostess KTVs and instead call for hostess KTVs to be government-managed: with robust health checks and identity tracking (albeit keeping all data confidential).Blaming and self-denial will not stop COVID-19, only openness and acceptance can.-#99021: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99021","['Like: 81 people', 'Haha: 19 people', 'Care: 7 people']",41 comments,14 shares

I found out that I actually like my supervisor .. But the thing is my supervisor has a girlfriend, and i have no intention on breaking the both of them. What I know is that his girlfriend is inside Malaysia while he's a PR here. We use to have eye contact all the time and we could stare at each other for awhile and i will always look at him like out of no where, and will always be wondering when will he come over (as he is station a little far away from me, PS working at a warehouse) and there was a time he started calling my name and honestly i am happy whenever he calls my name but I didn't reply him because i get nervous whenever he's around and that I couldn't help but to just look into his eyes. i know it sound very stupid but ya, i do get nervous whenever I'm around him is just that I try to uknow, faking that i am not nervous at all. everyday I stalk his fb account to see if he posted anything, all he post was some random live video or shared post. and his ig acc is private so ya, unless i follow him which i dont want to ..? cause i scared it will be way too obvious and that i am not surr if he feels the same way as i did. he act normally, there was once I wasn't happy and he came to talked to me but URGGHH cause i was nervous and I didn't reply and somehow we rarely speak to each other, and honestly that is kinda sad .... cause all i wanted was to like chat with him about our personal life, get to know each other more, and uknow become friend. But it seems like he isn't interested in it and that he is some how a shy guy i guess ..? cause i rarely see him talking to others, other than work related he have to.

Just wanted to share my story.I’ve been single practically my whole life (25 years) and been on multiple failed dates (mostly through apps). None of them ever lasted more than a month. After each failure I always wondered, ‘is there something wrong with me?’ ‘are my standards too high?’ ‘why doesn’t anyone seem to get me?’ ‘why can xxx get attached and I can’t?’ and I would get very disheartened coz I thought all my efforts to find ‘the one’ were useless.But, looking back I realise, all those ‘failures’ were not for naught. Thanks to all those failed dates, I learned more about the person I am, what I can and cannot tolerate in a person and what I am truly looking for in a partner. (Plus, I have some GREAT ‘weirdest dates ever’ experience.) Now, I am happily attached to the sweetest, most caring person I’ve ever met. My partner dotes on me and I’ve never had to be more than myself when I’m around them. TLDR… Put yourself out there and trust the process, the right person may appear when you least expect them to!

As weeks and months went by his condition got even worse that he can’t even do his daily routines properly without the help of my mum. Last week we admitted him to the hospital and after analyzing his condition the doctor told us that he does not have much time to live and recommended to send him to a hospice care.

And being single i thought maybe we could start talking and develop a relationship and maybe one day date if things work out. Things were going well at one point. Honestly we barely talked in messenger. It was mostly in comments. I would give him hints that i liked him. Like obvious hints. But maybe not obvious enough it seemed. I really like the guy. No one makes me laugh like he can. I wake up in the morning and the first thing i do i open facebook to see if he commented or liked my posts. No one else has gave me this feeling before. But recently he showed less interest in me. Less comments, likes, messages. It has made me quite depressed to be honest. Waking up and not seeing any notifications from him hits me pretty hard. I like him. But he doesn’t know it and I don’t know how to tell him because im afraid of rejection. Should i just leave our friendship as is and suffer in silence or try to make a move?

Whenever I think about this, I am always reminded that I am the guy that has never been worth kissing or dating. This is not even because I am consevrative. I am actually very liberal. I am up for anything. It isn't even due to a lack of trying. I am on 4 dating apps and honestly it's exhausting. I barely get any matches and most people I talk to don't even proceed beyond a few messages. I usually just get ghosted. idk what I am doing wrong. My only romantic expereince was a girlfriend I had for 6 months 5 years ago. SHe told me she was conservative and therefore wasn't comfortable doing anything sexual. But she cheated on my by sleeping with one of my friends while we were together. So clearly she was uncomfortable about me and not activity itself. I have a lot of close female friends with whom I have very platonic relationships with. But I really crave something more. I really crave intimacy. It's not just sex but just to feel loved, feel cared for, to feel like someone in this world actually gives a shit about what happens to me. I want some level of exclusivity in my relationships. I also want to have sex with someone I love and someone who loves me and to feel that connection. I want something more than just friendship. When I see other people in happy relationships, it makes me sad, jealous and envious. I am severely depressed because of this and idk what to do. I have been told to just focus on improving myself and that i will find a girlfriend when it is time but that is clearly bullshit advice because nothing good seems to be happening.

99009,"My BF and I have been dating for 3 years now. Coming from a religious and traditional family, my family initially did not like him as he did not go down the traditional Singaporean kid route - he did his own business, went on to work overseas for a few years (now he's back indefinitely cos of covid)and isn't in the same line of work as me. When we were doing LDR, we kept in constant contact. We have come a long way since we met. The days that he was overseas, it was really really tough for me but Im glad I survived that through weekly Skype and phone calls. I feel we are very compatible in all areas, and we are thinking about marriage. We have mostly worked and talked through most issues successfully, but 1 big mountain stands in the way -  religion. Religion wise, I have accepted him as he is and do not expect him to convert, but Im not sure if my parents will. They still try to convert him, and although he is civil when he is with them, he says that it makes him very unhappy as he feels unaccepted. He needs their acceptance before marriage, of which I have promised a talk with my parents but they are also very strong headed people. I cannot bear the thought of losing him. He says he does not want to cause a conflict between me and them, but there is already disgruntledness now at the thought that I may lose him because of them. I am even willing to distance myself from my family if it causes him so much unhappiness (ie cut down on the time he needs to spend with them) but he needs 200% acceptance from them. Not willing as well to believe that acceptance is a gradual thing and hopefully eventually they will. What are your thoughts? I want to be a filial child but on the other hand I cannot lose him. I know that if I do, I will really distant myself from them. Is there a compromise? Am I being fair to him to continue this relationship or this does not sound like a relationship that should go on?-#99009: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99009","['Like: 15 people', 'Sad: 4 people', 'Care: 1 person']",20 comments,2 shares
99008,"I would like to share my childhood story. Now I'm close to 30. I realised I have had unfairness in my childhood, which affected my life and career choice. I remember I was an active, sincere and talented child who loved painting, singing, dancing and I was very enthusiastic student in my primary school. I helped (I believed that I was helping) my younger brother with his classes in his primary studies, mostly doing his homework assignments by myself, as my brother was lazy. I used to draw different paintings and I enjoyed it. I dreamed to send my paintings to national journal for children and publish it there. And I did it! But... I felt that I didn't have much support and encouragement (as much as I needed) from my parents about my paintings. My brother was funny and cute child and also loved drawing, and he received so much encouragement from our parents and relatives. One day, me and my brother gave (casual) interview to a local newspaper and gave them our paintings. When our interview and two of our paintings are published, I found out that both of the paintings are drawn by me, but for one of them they gave the credit to my brother! (I know my parents made it, because this painting was the good one and they wanted to give false credit to my brother)! My school teacher told me that my brother's painting is better than mine, but both paintings are actually mine! I was 11 y.o. at that time, I was a sensitive child and I didn't know how to digest it, but for my parents and brother, it was not a big deal. After more than 15 years, I realise it was so unfair towards me!Now I realize that for whole my life till today, I have been seeking the approval of my parents in whatever I was doing. Somehow my parents believed in my abilities in math. Since I was good at my school studies, my parents always encouraged me to have excellent grades (so that I can have good career in the future). So I continued to focus in math in middle school, high school, college and after. Now I realize that math is not my passion and it changed my artistic nature. But I still remember that unfairness and want to let it go. I am writing here to give advice to young and future parents. Please ask your child what he/she enjoys doing and encourage them in this path for 100%. And please always be fair. Also, I hesitate to bring this topic to my parents. But I would appreciate your advice  (may be someone had similar experience with career choice).

99007,"Hi Prof Ben,I am doing my engineering phd at US and most of my work involves HPC and GPU. Just want to check with you whether what is the demand out there for HPC in case I cannot make it to academia and have to go to industry. I am aware that HPC is used a lot at national labs, esp in the US but what about industry? HPC doesn't seem to be demanded by industry as it is expensive and most industry problems can be solved on a regular pc, esp in SG.Additionally, how do you overcome the feeling of insecurity during your graduate years. For instance, seeing how all my friends are working, marrying, BTOing, etc make me feel a little unsure. Don't get me wrong I am happy with my choice as I get to do something I really like but what if my research fail and what if things don't work out?

99001,"Closure with an ex-lover:  Dear Mr _ _ _ (a pet name I gave you), it's been 1.5 years now since I made the decision to end our 3-yr-plus relationship. That was a time in our late twenties when I'd actually wanted to settle down. It was definitely an excruciating decision and a painful memory now, though I don't regret it. ""Do good and be kind"", you said. I griped to you afterwards that that kindness wasn't for us. I remember the wonderful days we used to strive together in the same job, talk at length about our hopes and dreams into the night and cradle each other as we retold childhood memories with tears streaking down our faces. I remember watching Titanic with you on yr desktop and then having you sob uncontrollably in the middle of the night as you related to me the grief after your grandfather's passing, a knowledge only we share. I remember having long conversations with you near my workplace, walking around the CBD area and just soaking in each others' presence. When we'd just gotten together, you travelled with me on my first company trip and threw me a well-planned birthday shortly after. I remember preparing welfare items for you when you juggled uni and work. We loved the same food, had the same adventurous sprit and were both intellectually curious. We were very much in love and very much aligned. I really did love you and what came after broke me.There was the gambling vice, acts of disrespect and numerous lies... all of which unveiled a very different character under pressure. As we progressed on in the relationship, you appeared more selfish, materialistic and less caring in general. Remember the time I broke down after I'd thought you'd died when you didn't show up at work, when in fact you'd been arrested for being in an illegal gaming den? You smiled (almost) when I received you at the police station when my whole heart had imploded with disappointment and hurt. That wasn't the first time you failed us but it was the worst and the subsequent many other lies exacerbated them. From the beginning, there were traces of questionable values but i didn't let them stop me from agreeing to be your girlfriend. For instance, for the purpose of achieving sales targets at work, you got cheated by a supposedly wealthy Indo lady (who turned out to be a con artist) and paid for her expensive phone bills in the belief that she'd buy a huge-premium product from you. I spent much time hunting her down and getting her to return you the thousands you'd lost in installments. During argument periods in the relationship, you disrespectfully chatted up your ex crush to confide in her about our private struggles or check out other girls on social media because you said the relationship wasn't fulfilling. As your career took off, you also became increasingly fixated on making money/appearing successful on social media and focused less on the relationship. I started blaming your job and also became afraid of losing you to your vices and became paranoid and clingy. It was through checking on you that I subsequently realized how many more times you'd lied about going for sales appointments when you were out gambling or drinking with friends. Back then, nobody knew the full story and were puzzled about my paranoia and frustrations. Unbeknownst to them, I only uncovered your lies after the 9th or 10th time that you'd lied precisely because I'd trusted you; the price of that was hurt. I know today that what went 'wrong' (e.g. yr vices/materialism) wasn't about yr job or surroundings per se, the onus was on you who chose those courses of actions. A healthy relationship shouldn't require doses of checking because both parties are truthful and responsible.  Recognizably, I became a bitter, angry and unlikeable person in the relationship and I hated how it had messed my emotions. In the later stages of the relationship, I even subconsciously wanted to conceal my face whenever I went out with you because I was ashamed of who I'd become. It's been a long time coming to terms with our demise, but at least, I can respect the person I am today. I chose to stay true to my values and my happiness is no longer dictated by the one who stopped caring. It is with regret that we will always be strangers from hereon out. I saw that you'd messaged me last year but I couldn't see the attachment and neither did I wish to reconnect. To me, the hurt you'd brought to my life is unforgivable. To the man I used to love, in health or in sickness and amid the plenty of lemons that life may throw at us ahead, we're on our own now. Time does reveal a person's character, so I hope you're no longer sucked into the life of posing for social media to sell your material success and instead strive to be a better person (inside) always.

98996,"At first I thought, hey Joseph. Why you never guard your gold? Why let other ppl take it from you? Then I went online to Google about the games. Saw some photos of him and did a compare and contrast with his photos from the past. Did he get bigger? Gained weight? Did it affect his performance? I started to think about what could have caused his loss. Physique is one thing. Next comes the lane he's in when he was doing his heats. He was placed at the edge of the pool. I believe many of us have watched a lot of pool action, and would have noticed that most wins happen at the middle lanes. But Joseph was at a disadvantage. He got the last lane. Sure, all pools are the same. Water same. Environment same. But the feeling is just not the same. Y'all know what I mean? Being able to see your opponents left right is an important adrenaline pumper. But for his case, he was not able to..Then I see ppl commenting on his body shape. I'm not sure of the gold standard body for swimming, but I compared his current form with Michael. Yeah the Michael he defeated. Michael is longer, a bit more streamlined, and leaner. Not entirely sure whether his current physique played a part, but I hope not? Because I'm pretty sure there are many nutritionists, coaches watching his weight and condition. So I'm not inclined to believe this point I saw online. And Joseph won Michael once too. Which brings me to reality. Yes, we have to face it. His experience brought me, and I'm sure many of y'all, back to the days in uni. Before an exam, you think you put in all of your efforts. You gave your best. Studied your tutorials, redid your tutorials, consulted tutors and lecturers, rewatched lectures and discussed with friends. You practised for finals. Your progress looked great. You felt prepared! But fast forward a few weeks when the results came out. Hey..what happened? C? Not even a B? Then, that's when you knew. Effort and your 'best' do not always equate to success. Yeah it hurts. You think you gave your all? Someone out there might be better than you. Someone in your major might put in more effort than you. Someone beside you might know more tips than you. You never know! You cry. You lament the harsh reality and unfairness of it all. C is a low pass. It will affect your CAP. Should you retake the course? Waste time on it again? Or focus on other courses? It's what Joseph is experiencing now I guess. I'm very sure he put in his best effort. His coaches gave him their all too. He felt well prepared, he felt great and he felt that he could win again. But someone out there got the better of him. From the initial skepticism and criticism within me to thinking about how his experience is just like any of ours years ago in uni, I feel a bit embarrassed. Too quick to judge. Too hasty and nitpicky. That's when I could feel his sadness within me, and I saw myself in my room again, holding onto my phone looking at the SMS results. C. Joseph (like I'm your friend lol). Or anyone reading this, know that your best effort may not always work out. Yes, it's reality. Most of us have been through similar experiences, just not at an international level. Know that you are not alone. You have your friends. Your coach. Your family. And many of us back in sg waiting for you and cheering you on. You may not have the chance to bring back the gold this time. But I hope the next time when you meet your opponents in the pool, you bring together with you our support, our cheers and our passion with you. Your best effort is enough. P.s. some people may think that prayers do not come into the picture.

Since then I have been thinking of her from time to time and it was like she gave me the physical contact that i craved for when i was still crushing on her. It felt nice but i am not supposed to feel this way so I'm vexed. It was like this soft spot in me suddenly pops up. Is this considered cheating? How should i deal with this?-#98992: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98992","['Like: 20 people', 'Haha: 9 people']",40 comments,6 shares
98988,"I come from a humble background where affording even the tuition fee of xyz per year would be difficult for my family.Yet, I applied to NUS keeping faith in my belief that ""hard work pays off"". My father runs a small travel agency. The travel and tourism sector in India has evolved over the past decade due to online booking sites and advanced technology. Travel agencies slowly became a dying career prospect.I received my offer letter from NUS to study Economics, Humanities and Sciences with the provision of a grant on 17th June, 2021.The pandemic dealt a final blow to the already dwindling business. Business was negligible during 2020 due to travel restrictions resulting in the lowest income in years. Business had to be shut down completely and my father had to start a new business from scratch this year. We cannot take education loans with high interest rates at this juncture with such an unstable and weak financial position. Additionally, my brother will go to college this year hence it will add to the expenditure. In the present circumstances, my family will be unable to afford even the subsidised fee.I have applied for scholarships, but, haven’t received a positive response yet, mainly for two reasons. First, I am an International student, hence that makes me ineligible for most of the externally funded scholarships and ALL the faculty donated scholarships. Second, most of the scholarships are for science / tech / engineering / medicine courses, hence, that makes me ineligible for both scholarships funded by external organisations and ALL NUS funded scholarships as well. I am reaching out to you, because I have heard you have helped students like me before with questions like these. I would be highly obliged to you if you could let me know about any other unexplored avenues that could be of help to me. My name is Ayushi Marwah and I look forward to hearing from you soon with any helpful response/leads.Thank you!!-#98988: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98988","['Like: 22 people', 'Haha: 12 people', 'Care: 5 people']",0 Comments,42 comments
98985,"I just want to thank Prof. Ben for reminding me (and us) that life is only a rat race if you choose to live it that way. His advice on this forum has saved me from implosion by leading me to make a life-changing decision to give up a high-paying job that I absolutely hated, in exchange for a job that I was okay with, a job that paid me an above-average (comfortable) salary, but a job that ultimately allowed me to spend more time with my wife and daughter.Dear Proffy,I went to RJ like you did. I studied CS (and applied math) like you did (albeit at Berkeley). My parents paid through their noses for me to go. My wife was my childhood friend. Our mothers were very close friends and we practically grew up together. When I decided to leave for California, I had already been dating her. I knew then that I was going to marry her. She knew too. In my mind, I felt that I had a responsibility to earn as much money as I could so I can give her the best life she could ever have asked for. But I never asked her what she wanted. I came back for a few years after graduating to work at a stat board, but I wasn't able to make a lot of money. I got married, had a beautiful daughter, but we were living in a HDB and I wanted better for my family. Partly through my college connections, I got a job at a FAANG. I discussed it over with my wife, and she agreed to let me go. She has a really mild personality and she tends to bottle everything in. In hindsight I should've sensed that she was heartbroken, but I was too distracted by a need to give her the best life that I could that I didn't realize the fact that all she wanted was just to have me around. I left for the valley and I spent 4 years there. I tried to come back as often as I could.I hated that job. I won't go into details about why I hated it, but I now understand that it wasn't just the job, I was just in a really self-destructive headspace. I was never from a very wealthy family and my expenses are very low. But after I got married my whole outlook changed. I wanted to be able to afford the best, not for me, but for my wife and kid. After 4 years of missing my family every second of every day, I decided to come home. I now work for GovTech, doing boring stuff, but I am happy every day because I get to go to sleep with my wife by my side. I get to watch my daughter grow up.No amount of money ever bought a second of time.-#98985: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98985","['Like: 692 people', 'Care: 89 people']",47 comments,82 shares
98984,"Writing this because life has been pretty overwhelming recently. At home, I am expected help my siblings in everything - house chores, cleaning up after them & even financially. (Just an FYI, I am not the oldest among my siblings) my parents expect things from me that they didn’t expect from my older sibling when she was my age. Sometimes, I feel like a servant. Whenever there is something that needs to be done, it automatically becomes my responsibility. My siblings could be home all day & not lift a finger but when I come home after a whole day of work, I am still expected to help with chores. No one is even grateful for what I do. Instead, my parents keep harping on things that I don’t do. I have only recently started my full-time job but they expect me to buy my siblings things that they want, treat them to meals, etc. It’s as if they are pushing the responsibility of being a parent to me. They always tell me it’s only right for me to help with chores since we are siblings. But how come they never ever say that to my siblings? Just because I am obliging and don’t voice out anything? I can’t wait for the day I have the ability the move out.

98978,"Something popped into my mind recently after seeing my friends get promoted. Is it just me that would prefer forgo a promotion if it means I have more work to do? It’s not that I don’t want career progression, but after some time, I don’t feel it’s necessary to rise all the way up and mid tier is good enough for me. As long as I have enough to save and spend I would be content. I would rather have time to actually spend my money. To be fair i am single with no debt so perhaps others with families would feel otherwise? I do feel that if I were married with kids I would still opt for this if my income with my spouse is sufficient as I would rather be able to spend time with my kids instead of working all the time.-#98978: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98978",['Like: 100 people'],29 comments,12 shares
98975,"Out of genuine curiosity here: do guys tend to take after their father more in terms of personality and habits the older they become?My boyfriend's father is a very authoritative person. He gets angry when things do not go his way and he is not afraid to show it. He likes to control things like the seating arrangement during family dinners and yes, he gets angry when anyone is unable to make it. Whenever my boyfriend's mother did not follow his instructions, he would tell her off and make the situation very awkward.I have been with my boyfriend for four years and he used to be a sweet guy. But lately i feel like i am beginning to see more traces of his father's personality on him.After i took my first dose of vaccine i was really lethargic and i told my boyfriend that i did not want to have dinner. I probably said it when i was really sleepy but i had no idea why he got frustrated with me. He then gave me the cold shoulder for the entire night plus the next day. On the third day he acted as if nothing had happened so i asked him about it. He actually said that he ignored me so that i could learn to figure out that i should not communicate with him that way. Another incident was when i was busy working from home and he kept trying to show me a video on youtube so i got impatient and said 'can you wait? I'm busy now' and he did the whole ignoring shit again. Guys please enlighten me whether these are red flags that show that my boyfriend will eventually become someone like his father. From the way the father treats the mother, i am pretty sure that i will not be able to put up with a husband who does not respect me.-#98975: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98975","['Like: 6 people', 'Sad: 4 people', 'Haha: 1 person']",31 comments,4 shares

98966,"One thing I regret was studying too much during my Uni days.As a working adult in a managerial position, it really irks me that I'm usually the ONLY person in the interview panel who actually cares about what the applicant's GPA is. I'm talking about entry-level hires by the way, not mid-career hires. Obviously nobody cares what your GPA is once you are applying for mid career positions but I would have thought GPA would be a significant factor in entry level roles.I've noticed that the rest of the interviewers usually don't pay much attention to the candidate's GPA. For me, I always found that good grades reflect important qualities such as discipline, diligence, responsibility, capability and to an extent, intelligence. All important qualities needed to succeed in the work place.But I feel like I'm in the minority as everyone else usually just takes a passing glance at the candidate's GPA, and generally pay more attention to internship experience, attitude and vibe. Call me old fashioned but internship experience is normally negligible (how much can you possibly learn in a few months) and attitude and vibe are very superficial qualities that anyone can easily fake during an interview. But you can't fake a good GPA.So unless you are gunning for a high level position like IB where GPA is a requirement, the rest of you just pass and get degree can already.I see so many of you here stressing over your GPA but trust me, it's like NS like that.When you are in NS, doing well and getting into command school can feel like the most important thing in the world. It's only when you ORD that you realise nobody gives a shit about what you did during NS.Same for GPA. It will feel like the most important thing in Uni but in the working world for MOST jobs, it really doesn't matter as long as you pass and graduate.-#98966: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98966","['Like: 154 people', 'Haha: 69 people']",98 comments,40 shares

And when we couldnt have it, how we felt as we looked on in envy at those who had it. Then we grew up and we felt this when we saw others getting the schools we wanted, the relationships we desired, and eventually the jobs/house/blahblahblah we dreamt about.we are affected by the lives we see our friends haveL the staycations they have, the meals they eat, the friend groups they seem to have, and this is further extended to instagram where we see lives of people we dont know and incorporate them into our idea of what is the standard of how “everyone else lives”it is so small, the places we live in, that we meet people we can compare ourselves to daily. our idea of what constitutes the baseline of being valued and having connection is skewed by these comparisonsis there a way to change this culture? I think perhaps not. My grandfather was not a bitter man. He was average by all means, and left the world with a memory imprinted on his close ones hearts, but nothing significant either, in his own words. in his many years seemed to believe it was a life of random variables, and people could be trusted here to keep their word and not do anything immoral, but beyond that, he did not seem to think we were capable of doing.could he be wrong? is the only solution out of this constant comparison to move across borders in search of a place wehre constant comparisons is not the norm?“The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life, seems to arise from over-rating the difference between one permanent situation and another.”― Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments-#98963: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98963","['Like: 84 people', 'Care: 5 people', 'Sad: 5 people']",25 comments,33 shares

98955,"There’s this girl I knew about 15 years ago. It was only during the first 3 months of JC. Even after going to another JC, we still kept close contact. She’s like the kind of perfect girl anyone can dream of. A very nice and funny girl. Comes from an above average family background. Looks pretty, cute and with a lovely smile. Problem is, shit happens along the way. She went on to NUS and went on to be a teacher. For the both of us, we just drifted apart. The trigger was something that wasn’t even my fault. I even apologised for it because ultimately, I was the only person she send her photo(it was only a normal photo) but apparently, my dick “friend” went  through my phone while I was playing football to download it off, and somehow, she found out. I didn’t even bother to ask her how she knew. Probably that dick guy was messaging her, gotten her number from my phone as well. (That dick guy was out of my life, and that was the day, I set password to my phone using her birthdate till now)That was probably the start when she couldn’t trust me. I felt so guilty, I didn’t know what to do. I chose to accept the consequences. And walk away. Previously, I knew her ex-bf, schoolmate of us during that first 3 months and he was jealous of me being her classmate and close friend, I did told him that she will only be my good friend, nothing more. I totally regret that statement. Cos the relationship evolved and grew deeper after that first 3 months. And I just couldn’t dare to ask her out formally on dates. Cos I did told her exactly what I told her ex-bf. From JC, and then she went to NUS, and then to NTU. Bumped into her in school back then, couldn’t talk much. Cos I still felt so guilty, when she ask me again about the photo. That was when I realised, the bus has left. I think she’s giving me a chance to tell the truth. But that was the truth!10 years later, I still miss her. No other girl ever made me feel connected and special. She was the one who made me into a better person, write formally even in messages. Shared similar interest in music and anime. Funny thing is, I was never attracted to her sexually even though she look above average, I was more attracted to her personality and her thoughts. 15 years on, I did try to search on her, and saw her wedding(without her face of course, just the wedding card and her guests). The guy is a smart guy, just like her, who shares similar music interest like the 2 of us. Could have been us. But the mistake of the youth could never been undone. I tried to forget about her. But 15 years later, fuck it. Just gonna keep good memories of her instead. I’m just glad she changed me for the better. The kind of person I am now, is largely thanks to her. And I don’t regret meeting her for those few years. She’s married now, what’s the point of trying to contact her. With that, this is probably an anonymous letter to end it as just memories.

98941,"I never thought i would submit a confessions after years of seeing NUSWhispers. Idk if this will be posted but I need to rant.I think I'm just here to know the opinions of others, not to actually look for advice. I have been single for a long time without having been officially attached for almost 10 years. I have gone on dating apps and met many people but things just seem to fall short or seem forced with a lack of connection or chemistry. Recently I have met a match and it was a totally different kind of feeling compared to any of my matches. This is a combination of both chemistry and character compatibility that not just fits my threshold requirements but far outstrips it. However I am also having issues as my date recently came out of a long term relationship and they went on the app to have fun initially. However after meeting me we both hit it off really well and have this desire to keep seeing each other, it has progressed to the point where we talk about future stuff and do couple stuff like holding hands, hugging or cuddling (I'm less casual so this is kind of a big level of physical contact to me). In fact even though we are not official, there's really not much diff in the way we act now.However, there is this other match my date has from the app. Someone they matched just a week before me and didn't meet. When I found out I was quite upset, cause I'm the type who would want to date exclusively(not official) once I do physical stuff and open up about my life and hopes for the future. However my date still wants to meet others and we've talked back and forth about this 3 or 4 times. I ask them how isit they like me so much to do all these couple stuff with me but still have this need to see this one other date (they said they won't want to see others anymore, just this date) because I can't do the same thing after being this close with any of my dates. My date seem to be unsure of what they're feeling as they keep saying that they don't feel like the other date is a hopeful match but is fun to talk to. But when I ask if they can stop talking to the match since they have only talked for awhile and don't have any actual connections other than thru the dating app, my date doesn't seem to be able to stop talking. Had a heated discussion about this recently as I really don't understand. But my date said after going through a long relationship they are really scared to go into another relationship seriously and if they stop talking to the other match and only to me then it will be like an all in commitment for them already. I believe this firmly as my date cried out while saying this to me. So I try to rationalise that my date is talking to the other match because if they stop then its like a full on commitment to me but my date isn't ready emotionally. In my head I understand now and am fine with It logically, but today they went out again to meet up and I feel emotionally unhappy about it. I don't feel like talking to my date or it seems like there's a clink in the usual chemistry we have cause of this and I can't bring myself to pretend like nothing is going on. I think ill just be myself and do what I can, if it really turns out into the worst scenario where my date ends up choosing the other guy in the end, ill at least know I did what I could.Sorry for the long rant.TLDR: I'm in love but I'm tormented-#98941: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98941","['Like: 16 people', 'Care: 7 people', 'Sad: 2 people']",46 comments,8 shares
98938,"Dear Prof. Ben,Since you went to RI, I’m sure you would have gotten to know some classmates/schoolmates who have now become wildly successful in their careers. And by wildly successful, I do mean very wealthy. I also don’t mean the punch-cards who are working upper-middle class jobs, being paid upper-middle class wages. I mean those who are being paid millions a year, or entrepreneurs whose businesses are making millions a year in profit.Since you were probably at the top of your cohort, do you secretly wish that you “deserve” more success than you have now? Or that they don’t deserve the wealth they’ve accumulated for not being as smart (or as hardworking) as you were in high school or in college?I ask this question because I went to Hwa Chong and I was among the top of my cohort. I pursued academia at first, because it was what I was really good at (just generally learning stuff deeply). I dragged my ass through grad school and ended up doing dead-end research for 5 years before I started a job in the industry (CS) where I was paid the same as people 10 years my junior, doing work that to me, is in all sense of the word—stupid. I have some ex-classmates who are now living in detached houses around Bukit Timah, driving luxury cars, one of whom was a middling student who used to copy my homework (he was smart just lazy). Almost every one of my crazy-rich ex-classmates are business owners, none of whom were particularly talented back in Hwa Chong. Maybe wealth doesn’t mean much to you, but I was hoping you could help me reconcile being one of the smartest person in school and now having to capitulate to the reality there’s little profit in being so academically-inclined.-#98938: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98938","['Like: 732 people', 'Haha: 75 people']",288 comments,1K shares

98895,"Hi 27F here. I was in a long term relationship for a couple of months before my ex broke up with me. After that, I went on a dating app spree and met over 10x guys. I was initially very fixated with the idea of finding a serious relationship. I dated one guy for a few months even though I knew he wasn’t looking for anything serious. I held on to it as I didn’t have anyone else I fancy and also I thought that time would change his mind. obviously, that didn’t happen and we eventually ended things. After that, I went on to meet many other guys. Out of those guys I’ve met, I was only interested in 1 or 2 but my interest eventually also faded off. Now, I’m starting to wonder if I just have bad luck in my love life or if I’m just not ready for a relationship. On hindsight, I wouldn’t have stuck with the first guy who wasn’t even serious about me if I was looking to settle down. Maybe it was societal pressure that compels me to want to find a serious relationship? Also, it’s very superficial of me but I also feel that many a times I’m lowering my standards when matching with or talking to guys on dating apps simply because the pool of guys on apps is not that great…-#98895: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98895","['Like: 46 people', 'Care: 8 people', 'Haha: 7 people']",56 comments,6 shares
98894,"Have you ever been in a relationship and it feels miserable? I was together with my ex bf for a year and he was not the type of son-in-law my parents like. My parents think my bf should be the type who brings them gifts on occasions like Chinese New Year, Mother’s Day and Father’s Day and he’s just the type of person who will do this. He’s thoughtful towards me like he will prepare slippers for me when my feet hurts from high heels, prepare towel for me when I need to take a shower after exercise. I do miss him every now and then and it has become more intense recently. After daily constant nagging from my parents, I caved in to pressure and broke up with my ex bf. My current bf is the above mentioned traits that my parents like. Not to mention that his parents owns multiple properties and collects rental for passive income on top of their full time job. But, whenever we go out we are almost always on dutch. I don’t get the feeling that I have a bf and he doesn’t last as long as my ex bf. He has brought up the topic of BTO in August and Im contemplating on it already but I keep it to myself and don’t let him now. He has also told his parents that we are going to BTO and if I do not go ahead, I feel bad. How to bring up the fact that I don’t like it when he reaches home and don’t shower then lie down on the bed, don’t brush his teeth when he is tired, don’t wash his hands when he’s home, leave dishes at the sink?I don’t want to marry and end up divorce because I may be the type who divorce without my husband having an affair since I’m financially independent myself and earns more than him.-#98894: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98894","['Like: 38 people', 'Haha: 16 people', 'Wow: 6 people']",58 comments,9 shares
98893,"Hi everyone I am in need of some urgent advice. Any police officers or lawyers here please help me..Recently my parents and I have been in what I would describe a dispute with a shop. The shop has closed down recently (they used to have a physical outlet in a mall). The dispute includes them (bosses of the shop) keeping our money that was meant for a package. They claimed that as the package had expire therefore no refund (few thousand dollars). However my parents and I was still allowed to use the package even after the expiry date before they closed down (they have accidentally showed us the signature card with the dates that service was provided). I know it is my fault for trusting them but is it entirely my fault? How am I supposed to remember everything. They also keep blame it on the service staff who we have no contact with since the shop is close. The service staff probably is only there to work, can they be held liable?We tried to explain our point of view to them but they refuse to come to a conclusion and did not want to refund a single cent. I don’t know how packages work as I am a male and not to stereotype but I thought the money should auto refund when the package is up? Correct me if I am wrong….To add on, they did not inform anyone of the closure. I went down one day and saw it closed. I did see some others who were standing outside confused as well.I am very puzzled about it and wanted to report to the police but I was told from my police friends that the police will most likely not do anything about it. Did anyone face the same situation as me?

98889,"I am a 27 (F) working in the town area. I would rate myself decent-looking and have had several ex-es who looks pretty good. A month back my company hired a new colleague who is 28 (M). My first impression towards him based on his appearances weren’t very good to be honest. He is not very tall (16-ish), nerdy-looking with an outdated hairstyle. He always goes out to lunch alone, probably because he’s shy and have not blended in yet. I tried my best to avoid him around work (I felt so guilty right now about that) but because of work-related issues, I can’t avoid him completely. There were times he consulted me and I had to teach him. Only just very recently, out of total coincidence, I found out his daily routine during our lunch break and after work. There will always be an old aunty selling tissues in a corner during lunch break and she always almost get ignored by the passer-bys, but this colleague of mine, he always gets her a cup of coffee/hot milo and buys her tissue packs at an overpaid price. I saw this while I was behind him heading to the same place for lunch. He would even tell the aunty he will be back later after work to see her. I was astonished. I later found out he literally does that everyday he is in the office. The packs of tissues purchased are now all stacked up neatly in his drawer. There was also another incident at work whereby he got reprimanded for doing the wrong things. I soon realised what he did were actually all instructed and taught by me. I thought he would tell on me but he just kept quiet throughout the entire lecture. When he came out, I hurriedly went over to apologise and all he said was, ‘it’s okay’ and gave me a wide smile. That was one of the brightest and genuine smile I have seen in my entire life. I feel that I have developed feelings for him although his appearances is entirely not my type. I feel that I can actually bypass all these judgemental impressions of mine of a person because of his character for the first time in my life. Please tell me how do I make my feelings known for him in a subtle way? I don’t think he has much confidence in himself and would definitely not be the one to initiate or confess. For the rest of the ladies out there, please take my heed. Looks are only temporal. What stays is the heart and mind. His heart is greater than everyone’s else.-#98889: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98889","['Like: 711 people', 'Care: 117 people', 'Love: 104 people']",255 comments,158 shares

98918,"TLDR: I don’t want to give money to NUS Annual Giving because it sponsors Scholarships that benefit those who are already rich.I think this opinion would be unpopular and some would say would be detrimental to those less fortunate who could really benefit from the NUS Annual Giving. However, I m going to say it anyway and let the dice roll.I graduated from a faculty where my batch had the tuition fees pegged at about $10k per year. It is amongst the most expensive in NUS. When I matriculated, I found friends in my faculty who resided in landed/private property and/or are given their own vehicles, who were also awarded scholarships by NUS.My point being that those already from well-off families are given an additional push with monies that would have come from the NUS Annual Giving. Heck, I have no issues with them being wealthy because the Almighty or whatever favored them but the system could do more to help those from less fortunate households with scholarships than the already rich.On the other hand, I have been told that scholarships reward the smart ones (regardless rich or poor) to ease their studies. Alternatively, to attract the brightest minds with financial incentives. But hey, you want recognition (either for the institution through its intelligent cohorts or for the student), that’s good, but not at the expense of those who want to give money to those who actually need it.Ultimately, I could be wrong but my personal interactions suggest there is a need to re-look at the criteria to award scholarships. The least I can say, prove me wrong with evidence.-#98918: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98918",['Like: 169 people'],45 comments,9 shares

Throughout my years in this same “branded” school, it was constantly drilled into us that we were and had to be better than “others”. In fact, one of the principals often compared us to the “neighbourhood” school next door, saying that our “bad” behaviour (e.g. BGR, lateness, untidy hair) are like GANGSTERS and HOOLIGANS like the school next door. Being a 17/18yo, I knew it was not right but what about the younger kids? Imagine growing up listening to this bullshit - if their parents didn’t teach them the right values they would grow up to be such f*cked up members of society.

I'm a lady and I'm dating a guy, we are both in our mid 30s.So we started dating for a few mths and it has been great until my parents found out the following:1) he is from a single parent family2) he is not as academically qualified (I'm a uni grad while he is several qualifications below, though now he is intending to pursue a ptime diploma)3) he earns much lesser than me (I earn more than double)Tbh, he is probably the sweetest guy and most sincere person I have met. And he makes me feel really happy and secure (emotionally)! He took my words seriously, and made changes to his lifestyle like taking up the diploma and changing a job. Even though its early in the relationship, we wish to work towards marraige. My parents who have not met him even, totally objects and disapproves of this relationship. They said, they will disown me if I choose to pursue this without their support.I want this relationship to work, of course there are challenges ahead. But I feel with finances this is something that can be worked through with effort and time. My parents however, are not giving this a chance and would like to shut this down ASAP. I am v confused because I love him alot and I'm willing to give it a shot. But the parental pressure is also amounting and causing a lot of distractions. He knows what is happening, and he is working on everything he can to solve them. But it will take time, effort and patience. But 1 thing he can't solve is his family background. This is a big concern to my family. Because they feel families should be compatible. This gap is too wide, and have 'downgraded' myself to be with him.I am so confused, I love him and want to give this a shot. But my family acceptance may never come because they don't want to even meet him and will never accept his background. Also, I am clear that we are running on a tight timeline, and there are things we need to achieve financially in the next 1-2y in order for us to progress forward. This is also communicated to him , but what if we achieved most of it and I wish to progress to marriage, and yet I still can't get my parental approval?

When he was tipsy he once mentioned that he would want to be with me if he were gay. I took that as a compliment and we just stayed friends. About two years ago, he went with me to a friend's wedding overseas. We shared a bed in a nice hotel and after drinking and partying we ended up kissing (with tongues!) throughout the night til we both fell asleep. The next morning, he spooned me. I almost went down on him but we stopped. We are still friends til today and he has been nothing but caring and sweet.

It is not just about the lust because he really is hot. A man like him is what I hope to end up with one day. He never posted any picture of his son and wife on his social media at all.

It shouldn’t be difficult to finish vaccinations in Johor as a way of getting them started on the path to economic recovery while the Malaysian government continues to work on the more difficult cases up North.

(Heard that it was given to students in the past before I matriculated in AY2020/2021, but is only available for certain student leaders now).To put things into context, I've only attended 1.5 physical modules in school in Y1 (out of 11 modules), the rest were all online classes. And as a FASS student, all my modules thus far are assignment-based, which means I have MANY group projects to work on. Does it make sense that all our group discussions finish in 40mins (which is the time limit for free Zoom users)? In fact, the need to constantly log in and out of Zoom is just such a distraction for our discussions.To compare, SMU and NTU students (not sure about the other universities) are ALL given Zoom premium accounts, and they have more physical classes than us NUS FASS students... Furthermore, with the school fees that I pay that permits me to use the school facilities, I don't even use them, since I attend classes at home anyways. The lack of use of NUS physical facilities can probably cover a Zoom Premium subscription?PLEASE PLEASE NUS, could we get Zoom premium access?

Most of his emails contain newsletters, subscriptions, and all the nonsensical stuff that we all have. However, he does receive many grab receipts as he takes grab quite often. So I clicked on those mails, and what I saw was he had been frequenting to different hotels during his off days. He doesn't overnight, and he will leave the location in an hour or so. I'm not sure if this is what the majority think it is (hmm like the KTV men) and I wouldn't want to believe it that way as well, but my dad also bought sildenafil (I went to google, it's for erectile dysfunction).

98837,"A big question has been on my mind lately.. Should I subject myself to being a 'house slave', which means working my ass off and reduce my quality of life just to afford a more expensive house, which is likely a good investment 10-30yrs down the road. It is really worth it? If I sell my HDB, it would mean that I will be making a profit of around 150k cash after deducting the loans, fees etc. Due to personal reasons, I will not be able to purchase another HDB flat. Hence, a resale Condo is my only choice. While I personally love the lifestyle of living in a Condo and enjoying the facilities, I would lose the physical living space as it will be a lot smaller. On top of that, I would have to fork out a lot more money for the monthly installment. I will likely lose the luxury to travel comfortably every year (once Covid settles) or splurge on expensive items/meals whenever I feel like it. I wouldn't be able to save much and if I want more money I would have to find ways to earn it, which translates to working more & working harder. As things are getting more expensive now, having a good long-term investment also seems essential to a more stable and comfortable retirement. And of course, enjoying the daily comfort of life while I'm young enough since there is really nothing much to look forward to nowadays. I believe it's all subjective, and there's no right or wrong.

Every time I have questions, I will have to wait for very long (like, a few days sometimes..) for her to answer me. If this was bad when in office, it got worse when we started to WFH. Days stretched into weeks. And she only replies to the questions which she wants to. I can only get all the answers I need if we get into a video call initiated by her and I can sit her down to ask. But it is far and few in between since she's always having meetings.So, my workload has not been very heavy while WFH because I am always waiting for people to get back to me. I do chase frequently but need to be mindful of how I do it, especially since I am quite new. I don't have a lot of other peers to ask either, as my position is quite an independent one.So.. while I appreciate that I am not worked to the bone like many of the WFH-ers, I am feeling quite lousy because there are days where I just do 1 or 2 tasks and that's it. I worry too, that I might be seen as lazy or incompetent.How is it like for the WFH-ers here? Am I the only one feeling insecure here?-#98828: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98828",['Like: 8 people'],0 Comments,3 comments

I was very happy for him, until I heard that he will be drawing 5k per month...I mean, I'm still happy for my bro, but I still feel that... you know, wah first job leh. Post diploma, I slog 5 to 6 years in engineering still 2.5k per month. My colleague slog for 10 years already still not at 4k range. Is this the difference between IT and engineering or is this the difference between diploma and bachelor's?

I wanted to job hop, but covid season hit us damn hard... While she says she doesn't mind as long as I have time for her... idk leh, I feel like I can give her a better life, so I feel damn bad hearing her comfort me and listening to others earning more than me.How do you guys cope with feeling like this?

98827,"Have been talking to a guy, and we are still in the get to know you phase. A meetup was planned but he overslept for the meet up. To give some background, i initiated the meetup so we can take this opportunity to get closer to each other? Prior to that, he wasnt actively trying to plan the meetup but i just brush that aside since i believe that was his communication style and i dont want to push things further (or maybe he just wasnt into me idk) He did apologise for oversleeping, but i just felt that for a first meetup, you should at least have the basic manners not to be late etc. (In the event that he is hesitant in the meetup, he could have told me so, hence i dont think by accepting someone invitation then dismissing it is very nice). I wasnt even asking much from this relationship, all i wanted was someone who can respect me and is willing to communicate when things gets tough rather than avoiding it. Eventually, we did not meet. I did voice out my opinions about this matter (that i felt that i wasnt taken seriously) but i have to emphasise that my intention was to speak up from my pov, and not asking for a confrontation. Need some advice here: am i wrong? (Opinions from all gender are welcomed) just wanted to seek  different pov but constructive and genuine replies only pls. Things was actually going well before this, as we do have some common topics to talk about. But of course there are times when he is selective about the things he is replying. From a female pov, when we are sharing our day with you, it means that we like you and just want to hear from you too. But sometime he just brush things off and continue his topic which i know wasnt intentional as he is busy. (To clarify, i did not spam him w message as i am aware of how annoying it can gets esp when we are working) I have dated and met guys before him, but none of them stood me up like he does. I did try to think from his pov, his reason was that he is tired which i can understand. But if you can be on time with your work etc, i dont see why is it so hard to meet someone for the first time and first impression do count. I am not saying like we cant be forgiving to mistakes like this, of course you CAN be late and CAN be tired etc, but i believe that only applies to a relationship that has been ongoing for sometime etc? Like we cant expect ppl to always be on time... But ultimately, do you think this can be a justification to his communication and attitude? I have to be honest, i do like him but i dont see why is it to hard to communicate?-#98827: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98827","['Like: 15 people', 'Haha: 8 people', 'Sad: 4 people']",67 comments,8 shares

I know that views like this that are widely spread  on social media may not really represent the majority of the female/male demographic here in Singapore, but is it really true?

She say I only do things when I want to.Due to the recent spike in covid cases, my parents told me not to go out. My gf asked if we want to go try a new hawker stall. I told her what my parents said and she just exploded. She said she can understand my parents concerns but then she say she is angry at me for hiding behind my parents. According to her. I always use my parents as a shield and she can't stand it. She thinks it's rude and unfillal. She said I'm pushing the responsibility to my parents instead of taking account for my own actions. What's the difference? Why she angry? What I told her was the truth.Continuing from the last para, I rejected her jio to go out eat and then I told her I spent my whole day at the library. She angry again. She ask why I scared of covid still can go lib whole day then cannot hang out with her? What's the link? Then she go on to say how I only put in effort when I want to. I am sian of her liao to be honest. I'm sick of all these negative energy. Then she angry at my eating habits. I don't like too much veggie. I don't like melted cheese. I don't like raw fish. I don't eat spicy and I don't eat steak (nth religious. I just don't like the texture). So we never eat Korean food, sushi, pizza, nice salad or went to a fancy steak restaurant. . She angry bcus she say I am very mafan. I told her I ate steak when I was travelling in US with my family. She angry??? US got nth to eat except for steak what. Besides, my family eats steak except for me so I kind of have to join in.Our friends also keep getting in our way. Our common friends tell her to leave me. They said I'm a lousy catch. This has been going on for years. Some of these common friends are my friends to begin with. How to tell them to stay out of it? Revently I found out my own friends jio her out without asking me. Their reason is because I'm hard to accommodate. Oh well, that can be their opinion. Sigh. My gf parents don't like me. Her parents think I am shallow and immature. I know she has been facing pressure all these years by people around her to leave me...idk if I can let her go. I don't think I am that hard to deal with. Idk leh. Seems like I only have issues when it comes to her. My other friends I don't hear such complains leh. According to my gf, she say that's bcus no one bothers to tell me bcus no one cares or at least no one sees hope in me, except for her. But I guess that's her opinion? Personally, if something doesn't suit me, I won't engage in it at all. Example, foods I don't like. People that upset me..including my own parents. My dad sometimes gets angry at me so I avoid him.

98803,"My spouse has recently joined a contract job (after a LOT of struggle in finding one) here in SG and is going through a terrible and traumatising time to say the least.[If no time to read a long post, pls go to the end “Closing” section]***First, some background about the job***The job requires staff to be logged in EXACTLY by a particular time - not even a minute later. If so, people start enquiring if something is wrong. The job entails working on a number of task items (using a generic word here to not give too much of a hint about the company) throughout the day, keeping in mind to complete each task item in a reasonable amount of time, and without quality issues. There is a quality checker at the end and there is an allocated lead who is supposed to be guiding the new hires complete their task items. At the end of each month, analysts are ranked based on how many task items they completed in a month and how many quality errors were assigned to them.There was a 3 week training prior to her (and others who were hired together with her) actually starting on the job - after which analysts were given LIVE task items to work on.A typical day actually sees her rushing through her bath and early morning routine and then jumping onto the chair somehow to start her day. Then she BARELY gets any time throughout the day to take a breath or look around, until she actually logs off. I provide her breakfast, keep the lunch warmed up before she gets the highly measured 30 mins break and help her with her snacks and tea, if any - because she really does not get any break.***Now, something about her and the job***She has had to pick up this job because she really has not been getting ANY interview calls at all - thanks to the recent rule changes due to Covid and hiring being focused on locals. Not a single role in her area of expertise was willing to sponsor an EP for her, citing hiring norms. And then this contract job came by a few months back and they were willing to hire her.The skills required for this job are something she has a bit of, but not a whole lot of. But even then, I have seen her try real real hard and come up to a particular level of speed and comfort which was not there when she started. The other thing this job needs is agility - they want people to be very fast. This is also something she is not the best at with the given skills, but I have seen a great deal of improvement from when she started out.***Now, the issues she is facing***The team lead that she is allocated to talks pretty rudely and insensitively to her and keeps calling out when she asks questions - he’ll either be condescending and ask her to read up reference material before raising questions, or he will cross question in a rude manner and end up making it look like she asked a silly question that she was supposed to know the answer to. The same team lead, when talking to another analyst (how she knows this is because the conversation between the lead and other analysts go on in a common group chat which every team member can see) goes out of his way to suggest solutions and provides clarifications even before that analyst could ask, and in cases when that analyst does ask, he has a plethora of answers ready for her - the whole conversation going on in a very normal and civilised manner.Every now and then, he and other team leads keep poking her about her speed and the kind of questions she asks.All this has not only led her to become extremely sad and upset, it has also led her to start believing that she is worthless and not valuable enough. She has lost self-confidence and as vicious a cycle as it is, her speed has slowed down even more and errors have increased.After the month of May, they told her that her performance was not that great. After the month of June, her performance was much better than what it was in May, but rather than motivating her to be better, they put her into an “Improvement Plan” , which is a more glorious way of saying “your performance is poor and we are monitoring you closely now”.This was a major setback for her and I have seen her cry at her work desk many a times - she does try to keep up a strong front, but at the end of the day it IS human to feel bad because of such unreasonable behaviour and bad treatment meted out.Must point out here that there are a couple of other leads with whom she has worked for a couple of days and had realised that they were very very different from the leads with bad management quality. However, the way this company is run (like an authoritarian place), she asking for a change of lead will not only be turned down, but could also fire back at her in a bad way. Hence she is wary of doing that.�***Closing***Basically, rather than nurturing and motivating an analyst who is trying real hard to keep up with the rat-race, they are being extremely insensitive and condescending and killing that person’s morale more and more.She is unable to take a step and leave this job because she knows that as a foreigner in SG, she will not get another one. But this job is REALLY taking a toll on her mental health and eventually physical health too.NOTE: Raising this to Sr Management is also something she is wary of because (a) being a contract employee she does not have much of a reach/say, (b) the management may be hands-in-glove with what is being meted out to her, in which case she will fall into even deeper trouble, (c) after getting beaten around so much, she has started feeling that she is indeed bad at what she does.-#98803: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98803","['Like: 15 people', 'Sad: 4 people', 'Care: 3 people']",14 comments,3 shares

For example, whenever we argue and I get upset and cry (not often), he will just keep silent throughout and would make no effort to comfort me. He claims that he doesn't know how to react. I mean all I need is a hug and some comforting words? We spoke thereafter and he said he understood my pov and will not do it again.Also, when we are texting back and forth and somehow a topic or subject that he doesn't like crops up, he would go MIA (i.e. bluetick) and reply hours later. This happened on multiple occasions and each time he apologises and promise it wouldn't happen again.We are both in our late 20s and I don't really want to seek another relationship. Overall, his personality is okay and I can see a future with him. I just want to understand if this is acceptable and if I should just suck it up? I mean it is nothing major unlike cheating. I tried talking to him but all he can do is to apologise (which is pointless if the same thing occurs again).

Initially, I was fine with it since its like a medium to let her de-stress and keep her entertained when I'm busy. Overtime, her obsession grew to the point where she would binge-watch almost every single one of the group's vlogs and always tune in to her idol's Vlives (its like a platform for idols to host their streams), and even buy their merch. Worse still, whenever we're spending time together (watching netflix/shows/etc) and one of her idols started streaming suddenly, she'll switch over to watching that, leaving me to do my stuff alone. Another time when we're out for dinner on a date, her idol started streaming out of nowhere and I could tell that she seems really disappointed that she couldn't watch his stream since we're out.I've tried talking to her about this matter but she just brushes it off as I'm being childish and insecure.Am I really wrong for making such a big fuss out of this?-#98795: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98795","['Like: 24 people', 'Haha: 19 people', 'Care: 4 people']",44 comments,10 shares

98791,"Hi, I'm a girl so, I just wonder if the other girls out there think the same as I do.I have a good friend who is a closeted gay guy. He isn't out for many reasons such as societal and parental pressures. For all his life, he has had a few discreet relationships with guys but recently, he told me he wants to try dating a girl and has been seeing a girl for a few weeks now. He says it's been going very well and he could see her as a ""potential partner"".So here are my concerns:1. He broke up with his ex not too long ago and told me he often cry thinking about him. So, isn't dating anyone now gonna be a rebound?2. I told him that he can't be selfish to date a girl becos of ease of accountability to society. He needs to be transparent with the girl about his attraction to guys and his past same-sex relationships. But he says its his problem and none of my business. 3. Knowing him for 3 years, his thinking can be really immature and irrational, which is why I'm constantly tryna remind him about repercussions since I care about him and the ppl he dates. Now girls (or maybe guys), if you're the girl he's seeing right now, would you want your date to be upfront honest about themselves esp. if they're not straight? If you guys do become a couple, do you deserve to be cheated on becos your BF can't stop thinking abt guys? I mean, if you're okay with dating a gay guy, you would at least expect him to be honest abt it, isn't it? I'm his good friend and I am concerned about his feelings, but he can be so obstinate and delusional... I just hope the girl will not be shortchanged too greatly.

98783,"Can anyone give me advice on how to deal with my marriage? I am 37 this year, married to my husband who is 39, for 10 years after 8 years of courtship. We have 2 children together, age 4 and 2. My marriage seems to be alright on the surface but there are many incidents that happen beneath our supposedly strong union. I came from a low income family with 1 older sister and a younger brother, my sister is married. My parents did not have much savings and they are still paying for their house instalments for their flat. I only get to know about how my parents got by through my sister’s husband when he was complaining about tightening their finances when they are earning a combine income of more than 11k per month without car and their house fully paid for. Their contributions goes to the house instalment and monthly expenses. I realized that my own contribution pales to them but my husband suggested that I pass my parents cash infront of everyone to show that we contributed. My younger brother who is in his late twenties could not help out as he could not land a job to support himself as he only wants a job that is cushy and only requires talking but high salary despite only being a diploma grad. The reason to why my finances is tight, because we took out a max loan to finance a 3 bedroom condo so that my husband can feel good in front of our family members and friends. He works as a logistic executive drawing around 3k without allowance and I worked as a chemical quality engineer drawing close to 5k. To most ppl, a combine income of 8k seems to be just nice to finance a condo, given that we have worked for more than 10 yrs individually and should have accumulated a good amount of CPF and savings. However, my husband’s job only start to have CPF allowance about 9 years ago and we paid for our BTO using mostly from my CPF account. We barely hit the minimum CPF deposit despite wiping out our CPF OA for the condo deposit but we received a decent amount of cash proceeds from the sales of the house. Despite the surplus of cash, during my second pregnancy, I was not allowed to go to a private hospital and gynae as my first pregnancy was quite tiring when we opt for public hospital and with a 4 bedder room. I was not able to rest properly and had to put up to it. When I saw my older sister’s both pregnancy at a private hospital with round the clock care by nurses and gynae, it makes me feel very low to why I could not afford such simple luxury when I am able to but had to channel my finance to other areas.It has been decided by my husband that the condo will be used for rental, as our salary could not afford the cash instalment but we are currently facing difficulty getting a good rental in such market due to covid. Therefore, we had to move back to my husband’s parents place which was hellish for me before we move to our HDB. I was treated like a maid but need to contribute to the household expenses. As my husband is the eldest of his four siblings, but the lowest educated and income, he often likes to treat his side of the family to meals worth hundreds of dollars to show off to his university educated siblings that he could afford despite being only diploma educated while his siblings enjoy the free food. To shoulder the expenses, he turn to illegal means and also use part of my salary. Holidays now is just a pipe dream for me as I could not afford to go for holidays as the money needs to be poured into his quest to showcase. The best I could do was a short trip to Malaysia. Whenever I see my sister’s family goes for holidays in Japan or Europe countries, I often feel very low and helpless. Even when my parents goes for holidays, my sister’s side will help to pay for their expenses and I could not help out much.Not sure if my standards are low, but I think my husband is still a decent person as he doesn’t visit KTV lounges, clubs before. Probably he doesn’t drink because he could not stomach alcohol. It’s just that he needs to be the best amongst his friends and family. He will always highlight the incompetence of his friends despite them being better off than him and require me to constantly reminding him of how good he is. I know that he dislike some of my relatives especially those younger cousins who dares to disagrees with him as well as those who are better than him to the point that he could not put down. I’m not sure what can I do about it as he can be very competitive in the area of ‘face’ as he simply cannot lose face and cannot be wrong at any occasion but he also refuse to improve on himself. I wonder how should I go about it.-#98783: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98783","['Like: 20 people', 'Care: 13 people', 'Sad: 12 people']",48 comments,9 shares

Don’t get brainwashed by the managers who are trying to recruit you that it’s such good money and that you can also do it. They earn an overriding commission from their team members so of course the more the merrier. My team manager makes $30-60k a month alone on his team overriding commission; and that’s on top of his own sales. Don’t forget that these people are highly skilled salesmen who can sell ice to eskimos. The reality is that only the TOP 1-5% of ALL agents make good money & the rest are barely making it. I am not exaggerating. The people in the Top 5% are making all the money. If you’re not in the Top 5%, u can totally forget about it. There’s over 30,000 agents in Singapore- u do the Maths. In my first 2-3years, I burned through all my hard earned savings on PropertyGuru credits (I think burned about 5k), various training courses (3k here and 6k there), various apps & misc expenses. Besides PropertyGuru, there’s also EdgeProp & 99.co- also need to buy credits. Another 20-30k burned on Facebook & Google Ads. In this industry you will burn a lot of money first (easily 20k or more in your first year) before u even make your first cent. If you do not have at least 12 months of expenses saved PLUS min $20k for all these necessary expenses, don’t even consider it. That’s not the worst part. Just because u burn money on PropertyGuru, Facebook & Google Ads doesn’t mean u will get genuine leads. 95% of all your leads are time wasters. They don’t respond when u contact them. Msg never reply. Or they will make appointment with you & then never show up. A lot of people who fill up your lead form on Facebook are just bored and have no genuine intention to sell or buy property. Cold leads from online marketing are almost impossible to close. Most of them are just “look see only”. I spent over $20k to learn this the hard way. Don’t be like me. I cannot tell u how many times people have flown my plane. I travel down to the location and waited for an hour & the person never show up. If you’re a woman, you’ll constantly get harassed by nuisance calls and texts by random male strangers. Because our contact number is readily available online, many men will think it’s okay to take your number and abuse it freely. Pretend to be a buyer interested to buy property, and then after wasting your time for hours, ask if you’re single. Everyday I will get at least one dodgy text or DM from some creepy anonymous male stranger on various platforms. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. This year after deducting expenses, not only did I not make any $$, I lost around $15-20k. It’s depressing to think that the people working in McD & cleaners actually earn more than me. The truth is- You’ll HATE the job UNLESS you’re a natural salesman who genuinely loves interacting with people. The key words being “GENUINELY LOVES”. I am an introvert, I hate going out, I hate interacting with people in general and I suffer everyday in this job. So please take my advice. Don’t do it. It’s very painful & not as lucrative as many people think. Most agents make around $50-100k a year? Might as well stick to a regular day job with CPF and benefits. The real perk is the security of knowing u have a fixed paycheck coming in every month. The dumbest thing one can do is leave a stable salaried job for this fucking “job” where U actually have to pay money to do shit U hate & talk to people u can’t stand, everyday going around for viewing after viewing after viewing like a free fucking tour guide.  People don’t care about wasting your time, cos you’re just an agent. Nobody will tell u this shit because frankly those who are struggling won’t admit to anyone they’re struggling, and the few who are doing very well won’t understand why you’re struggling. I just wish somebody had told me this shit years ago.-#98792: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98792","['Like: 539 people', 'Care: 83 people', 'Haha: 45 people']",325 comments,1K shares
98790,"Starting my uni soon and I'm little anxious. My high school life has been not the best. While others went for parties and had graduation sleepovers, I was at home in the corner of my room. Graduation day was very quick. After the ceremony, I didn't bother to take pictures with anyone... since I didn't see the point of taking pictures with people who didn't give me any memories. I still remember how I cried that same day later evening... scrolling through the other pictures everyone else posted on Facebook, cheering and having fun, taking group shots, with teachers, parents and BFFs. My mother was the one who consoled me that night... That very day, I had alot of regrets in me... How could I have my school experience a better one? I should have talked to more people, maybe be a little more outgoing and stepping out of my comfort zone. I also realised I (the friends or acquaintances) I made were all the wrong ones, all toxic and of no benefit. Basically, high school was a failure (in terms of making long lasting friendships) for me - and this is the biggest regret in my life so far. I could have done better...Generally, I'm more of an introvert... but if I do meet anyone (and I am able to click with them) I can talk for a pretty long time... and I don't mind talking about problems people have and giving them advices... I guess being an introvert is difficult in a social world. The guys who I used to make friends with in school were toxic... they didn't want to see me change and come out of my comfort zone. I tried making friends with some of the girls but they wouldn't even bother responding to me properly, when they would give their time in for hours with the other guys.Currently doing some gap year(s), but thinking of joining uni soon.

98777,"Can anyone give me advice on how to deal with my marriage? I am 37 this year, married to my husband who is 39, for 10 years after 8 years of courtship. We have 2 children together, age 4 and 2. My marriage seems to be alright on the surface but there are many incidents that happen beneath our supposedly strong union. I came from a low income family with 1 older sister and a younger brother, my sister is married. My parents did not have much savings and they are still paying for their house instalments for their flat. I only get to know about how my parents got by through my sister’s husband when he was complaining about tightening their finances when they are earning a combine income of more than 11k per month without car and their house fully paid for. Their contributions goes to the house instalment and monthly expenses. I realized that my own contribution pales to them but my husband suggested that I pass my parents cash infront of everyone to show that we contributed. My younger brother who is in his late twenties could not help out as he could not land a job to support himself as he only wants a job that is cushy and only requires talking but high salary despite only being a diploma grad. The reason to why my finances is tight, because we took out a max loan to finance a 3 bedroom condo so that my husband can feel good in front of our family members and friends. He works as a logistic executive drawing around 3k without allowance and I worked as a chemical quality engineer drawing close to 5k. To most ppl, a combine income of 8k seems to be just nice to finance a condo, given that we have worked for more than 10 yrs individually and should have accumulated a good amount of CPF and savings. However, my husband’s job only start to have CPF allowance about 9 years ago and we paid for our BTO using mostly from my CPF account. We barely hit the minimum CPF deposit despite wiping out our CPF OA for the condo deposit but we received a decent amount of cash proceeds from the sales of the house. Despite the surplus of cash, during my second pregnancy, I was not allowed to go to a private hospital and gynae as my first pregnancy was quite tiring when we opt for public hospital and with a 4 bedder room. I was not able to rest properly and had to put up to it. When I saw my older sister’s both pregnancy at a private hospital with round the clock care by nurses and gynae, it makes me feel very low to why I could not afford such simple luxury when I am able to but had to channel my finance to other areas.It has been decided by my husband that the condo will be used for rental, as our salary could not afford the cash instalment but we are currently facing difficulty getting a good rental in such market due to covid. Therefore, we had to move back to my husband’s parents place which was hellish for me before we move to our HDB. I was treated like a maid but need to contribute to the household expenses. As my husband is the eldest of his four siblings, but the lowest educated and income, he often likes to treat his side of the family to meals worth hundreds of dollars to show off to his university educated siblings that he could afford despite being only diploma educated while his siblings enjoy the free food. To shoulder the expenses, he turn to illegal means and also use part of my salary. Holidays now is just a pipe dream for me as I could not afford to go for holidays as the money needs to be poured into his quest to showcase. The best I could do was a short trip to Malaysia. Whenever I see my sister’s family goes for holidays in Japan or Europe countries, I often feel very low and helpless. Even when my parents goes for holidays, my sister’s side will help to pay for their expenses and I could not help out much.Not sure if my standards are low, but I think my husband is still a decent person as he doesn’t visit KTV lounges, clubs before. Probably he doesn’t drink because he could not stomach alcohol. It’s just that he needs to be the best amongst his friends and family. He will always highlight the incompetence of his friends despite them being better off than him and require me to constantly reminding him of how good he is. I know that he dislike some of my relatives especially those younger cousins who dares to disagrees with him as well as those who are better than him to the point that he could not put down. I’m not sure what can I do about it as he can be very competitive in the area of ‘face’ as he simply cannot lose face and cannot be wrong at any occasion but he also refuse to improve on himself. I wonder how should I go about it.-#98777: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98777","['Like: 4 people', 'Care: 4 people', 'Sad: 3 people']",0 Comments,7 comments

98763,"Can anyone advise if resale flats are worth to get for a first time home buyer? Me (29M) and my gf (28) are going to get engaged in about 6 months. As you all might have known, COVID has caused some delays in the BTO construction. BTOs are already not easy to get under normal times. Currently, if I were to add up the whole process of balloting, selection, construction, renovation, moving etc, it will be at least 6 years optimistically before we can move in. We can also considered getting a resale flat but they are really more costly and the prices have gone up too. Due to our limited funds, we can only perhaps afford a 4 rm max in a non mature estate. I think that current prices of resale, we will not be making much profit, if any at all when we sell. I just hope that it won’t depreciate too much. I am also worried about the wear and tear that comes with a old flat. Is it a good idea to get a resale flat as the first house? Some background: our combined income around 9k. We are looking to stay in the medium term at least 8-10 years. Not in dire need of a house as we can stay with parents as a last resort but still really hope to get our own place.-#98763: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98763","['Like: 4 people', 'Haha: 1 person', 'Sad: 1 person']",8 comments,4 shares

98720,"There have been much talk about racism recently and such sensitive topics inadvertently incite emotions and nationalistic sentiments among Singaporeans especially if they feel shortchanged in our society. As a patriotic Singaporean, I do feel strongly for my fellow countrymen and women when I hear and read stories about them being discriminated in the workforce by foreign expats who are landing on our shores in droves. Accounts such as locals receiving a lower salary as compared to expats for the same type of job, promotions and big salary packages are only reserved for certain nationalities/race, the list of grievances goes on. I have been working in an international bank for the past 5 yrs and the majority of my colleagues are foreigners from a variety of countries across different continents. When I first joined, it was immediately apparent that Singaporeans are the minority, we occupy mostly the lower, mid level jobs while the seniors are mostly foreigners and caucasian. It was really rare to see a local taking on a top job, in fact, none of the senior folks (MDs) in my department are Singaporeans. From this perspective, it would be extremely easy for me to put it down to pure discrimination and join the complain brigade about how our government has sold our country off to foreigners and foreign corporations for profit while throwing Singaporeans under the bus while telling us to continue to work hard. Having said that, I did reflect on the environment I was in and wondered if it was better to leave and seek greener pastures where Singaporeans are more appreciated or at least be treated on equal footing. However, I realised that things may not be as simple and straight forward as it seem. Intelligence wise, locals are definitely equal or even smarter than many foreigners I have come across, but when it comes down to pure performance, I would be lying if I were to say the same. I am not really sure why, but Singaporeans are a quiet bunch, they don't like to voice their opinions, give ideas, volunteer for projects, present a differing argument or even stand up for themselves when they are being wrongly accused (intentionally or unintentionally) about something. As someone holding a mid level position, I do try my very best to mentor the juniors, telling them not to be afraid put themselves out there as that's the best way to learn and grow but my advice normally fall on deaf ears. When they do leave the organisation after a year or two, the reasons are the pretty standard gripes about unfairness, lack of opportunities and discrimination. How often have I heard my Singaporean colleagues tell me that they hate networking, hate having small talk, hate having to present something in front of a crowd. ""Just leave me alone and let me do my work in peace"", they said. Especially in a large international organisation where people from all over the globe fight to stand out amongst the crowd, can someone who just wants to do their job in peace and quiet expect to be recognised and rewarded more than another who dares to risk embarrassment and making mistakes in a bid to exceed expectations and differentiate themselves from the rest? Of course, the above is not representative of every Singaporean in all areas of society, it is just my observations in my work environment. Although I doubt this will change anytime soon, I do hope that some  day I will be able to witness our young Singaporeans grow and develop into leaders with a global mindset ready to interact with foreigners on an equal footing.-#98720: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98720",['Like: 73 people'],15 comments,5 shares
98719,"Mine is similar to OP of #98700. In my case I am also married to a woman who I dated and married. We have been together for 15 years and we love each other very much but we have never had sex.In the fifth year of marriage I was posted for a short stint in Thailand. There, I saw many pretty women. I wanted to control my urge to go for them to replace the sex I never had. But something told me in my mind that I will be cheating on her. I love her a lot and I did not want to see her cry. It will break my heart. So I decided to go with my original flow before I met her. I used to dress up as a woman. So I bought cosmetics and dressed and dressed up and went to one of those illigal backlane shops where you walk in as a male and walk out as female. There is certainly some risk due to it being illigal but mine went well. Some 8 months later when I came back to Singapore, I told her about it. She did not mind. We are still happy together. In fact, I feel that the bond is stronger after my gender transformation surgery. In August 2021 we will be celebrating our 16th anniversary. What I will say is that marriage need not mean sex. Couples can still be happy without sex and children. The happiness comes from love and acceptance. Just cuddling close together everynight feels like heaven! I hope if there are other couples who lead the same life, be positive.

98715,"I need some advice. I am having troubles having closures with this date that I had. I went on a date with a 27M ex-steward that I met on dating app. We took the conversation off to tele as he seemed interested and sincere to get to know more about me. Continued interest between the two of us led us to our first date. He was very sweet with his words and would share with me about his future plans and bare his heart to me. Moreover, he displays his love very affectionately as well and hugs me while we were on escalators. With a guy being this serious about sharing his future with me, it is normal that any girl would think that this guy is potentially serious about developing this relationship? Anyhow, this continued for 2 weeks and he suggested that we should have a staycay. I agreed to it, knowing what it might entail p.s. girls have needs as well . During the staycay, he proceeded to pleasure me by kissing me repetitively on my feet and my armpits. This is where I think things started to get a bit weird but I didn't think too much about it. We had intercourse for around 2 mins, and he requested for a BJ. And then, that's it... So many questions popped up in my head then but I didn't wanted to spoil the mood.

However, over the course of that year, we figured some negative sides about each other. To the extent that she was opposed to the marriage in the last 2 months. However, after family intervened and a lot of discussions, we went forward hoping for the best. Cut to the present - we have never had sexual intercourse ever. In the initial years she didn't want to, then I started losing interest because of her not showing any interest and now it looks like she has lost all interest in sex. We love each other a lot and care for each other. I have zero doubt that she is very very emotionally attached to me and cannot imagine life without me, and neither can I - hence separation is not an option at all. Very recently, she has started saying that we should slowly start to initiate our sexual journey - though, it has not been a stage where she is ready to go! Also, she doesn't like talking dirty or talking about sex stuff much - and I Love it. I have this wish to be a Dom to a Sub, which I used to hope my wife would be for me, but looks like all that is surely not a thing to happen in this lifetime.

Plus she already made plans to shift in with me when she retires lol (and I agreed liao siaogao what was i thinking). Actually I enjoy my mum companionship a lot. But there are times she get so unbearable and abusive. Like for example when she's in a bad mood, she will start to pack the house. She pack the house is her problem lah, but then she will start yelling at my siblings and I. She will yell at me for putting my half-finished bubble tea cup on the kitchen table. Or scream and shout about the pack of unopened M&Ms I put on kitchen table. And then she will grab everything and throw it inside my room. And the ironic thing is, when it's her stuff she just ignore lol. We have a bottle of coconut water and a box of agar jelly on the kitchen table (they're both hers), still not kept at the right places. The point is, when she's in a foul mood she will kpkb everyone else's stuff.Things are not good even when she's in a great mood. She gets excited and slaps me (because wfh i sit next to her at the desk lol kns then i kena the most). But doesn't matter because since young she hit me like nobody business so this is small thing. It does get annoying lah, when I'm focusing and I suddenly get slapped. Sometimes, I get damn dulan when she does this. Then I yell at her. How to give in? Out of 10 times, I can give in 7 times. The other 3 times I sure hot one. When I was younger when my hell of a stupid and tiko father was around, she will force me to sit there and witness their fights. Few times it got super violent. You all dunno lah, even catch the cb vixen also she drag me along. Oh btw, my dad cheated and is out of the equation now.

Walao damn cheena the taste. There are so many brands better than Rolex wtf? I'm the eldest child, so I understand there are certain unspoken obligations.

She doesn’t even have the courtesy to just move my pillow away or to just take the charger and shift it somewhere else.

98685,"I’m a woman who found my husband late (at 32) and I just wanna say to all those 30-and-above who are looking for the right man, these things take time and it is okay to be single.I dated 2 guys before him and they weren’t right for me. Commitment was the main thing they, as well as many guys nowadays, lack. My definition of commitment is very simple, there needs to be an understanding that once you decide to be with someone, you will be faithful to them until you die. I don’t want to have to hear all this crap about having platonic female friends whom you hang out with more than you hang out with me, or liking and following Instababes. I’m old-fashioned that way. Once you’re with me, you commit to me and I commit to you, forever. Otherwise the whole marriage/relationship thing is pointless.My husband has had a crush on me since we were in JC. He did not have a single girlfriend since he confessed to me then. We got together at the age of 28, 10 years after our awkward encounter as teenagers. I wasn’t even in his class. We just had a mutual friend. After JC we didn’t speak for a couple of years until we bumped into each other in Europe. That was when I realized maybe we were really meant to be with each other. And then our mutual friend told me he has been asking about me every time they met for 10 whole years. No he didn’t reach out to me for 10 years, and he said because he didn’t want me to be uncomfortable because I was always with someone else.So far, he has been the best husband any girl could ever ask for. He lets me do whatever I want, he supports me, he spends time with me, he insists that he washes the dishes, he does laundry, he irons my work clothes, basically he just trusts and loves me completely. Every morning, the first thing he does when I wake up is he will gently kiss me on my shoulder. He has done that every day since we moved in together. I don’t know man. I just know I’m never leaving him.I think sometimes we marry the people we love and other times we love the people we marry. With my husband, I think I fall in love with him a little more every day I’m with him and now I’m completely obsessed with him. I can’t sleep without having him next to me, and every time I go on overseas work trips for just a few days I’d cry in my hotel room because I’d just miss him so much.If you don’t find someone good, don’t waste your time.

I think I am not just attracted to his nice physique but also how he talks and carry himself. We kept in contact and chatted online and in person occasionally, until one day I can’t take it and just confessed to him. He was calm and he said he was flattered but wasn’t ready for a relationship as he wanted to focus on his life and studies. So I respected his decision but we kept on as friends, though my feelings never went away but I never brought the topic up again. That was until about a week ago when we were having a more heart to heart talk. He brought up about my previous confession and said that he has given some serious thought. He said that it’s not that he doesn’t have feelings for me but said that he didn’t really want to commit to a relationship and asked if it is okay that we become fwbs? Should I take up his offer? I was thinking that I can get close to him if we become fwb and hopefully he can get into a relationship with me some day.

98679,"I am feeling very lonely and feel really bad (I don't even know how to describe this feeling).This is a rant and duh, it is going to be very very negative. I suggest that you dont read this post.As a shy and introverted person in my early childhood, I have  always had problems making friends (even now). My appearance and background differs from the norm which made things much harder. As a means to an end, my way of avoiding alienation was to be nice and helpful to everyone. It also prevented me from getting bullied too much, especially when I was younger. In my mind, I was happy not getting bullied as much as before and I dont have to sit alone for recess. I continued this strategy throughout my life which in itself was a form of torture. The problem was that people would include me in their group because I brought value, was useful and helpful (studies, projects and sports). In reality, it is a struggle to connect with them and I never felt valued as a friend. When asked for an opinion, I used to give my opinion but it was constantly disregarded and sometimes, it would even result in conflict. Being the ""different"" guy, the rest of the group would be against me. After those experiences, my answers have been just ""anything"". As you may have guessed, all my friend circles that are purely guys. My experiences with girls have not exactly been great. I have always wanted to have a female friend. Not even talking about romantic relationships which by the way has been non-existent. Just looking for just good platonic friends. Whenever there are groups of guys and girls eating and happily chatting away, it made me feel really jelous. I did have girl class or school mates with whom I did projects with but most people just interact with me for the projects and then, nothing else. They would however, be good friends with my other guy friends. Then, it was uni time and I really hoped that people would be more mature. Hoped for a better friend circle in my faculty but it was the same crap all over again. I was in engine so again all guys. I was determined to change my future so I joined a CCA. There were both guys and girls and really hoped that I could make some awesome friends. The speech made by the president on the open session that the members will become as close as family made my hopes go up sky high. However, not many people interacted with me for the first few sessions and there were cliques starting to form. Tried joining some of the cliques but felt the resistance and awkwardness. In the end, just joined the other dudes were without any cliques because they joined late. Still positive, tried to make friends with them at least. They came in inconsistently so it was hard to be become close. I was still determined. As time went by, lesser people started to attend so there was no choice but to include me in their cliques. I did not let it go to waste. I would try to talk to everyone I met, be as genuine I could and be as positive as possible (be it guy or girl). The whole cca group dwindled down to a very small size. I kept going to the CCA despite the workload and even when there were only like 3 or 4 ppl turning up. Sometimes, people would not talk to me so I would take the initiative, approach them and talk. If it felt awkward, I would back off immediately or if the person seemed interested, then would try my best to have the best conversation possible. I was not making any close friends but the hope was that my effort would one day help me . Stayed in the CCA for about 1 year. There was not much progress. When everyone came into the room, they would sit beside people whom they want to interact with. That is just how it was. I would go in early but no one would sit with me. Only the last few people would sit beside me because there was just no space in other groups. Despite knowing everyone, it was extremely depressing to know that no one would want to sit with me unless the situation forced them into it. Then, it happened. We had an activity where we had to sit in a circle so everyone could see everyone else. The group was quite small. I was kind of ignored during the activity but that is still fine. Then, the activity was over but we still had some time so everyone was talking with each other. No one talked to me. I was so stunned. They know I was just there not interacting with anyone but no one cared. I was feeling tired that day so I did not initiate any conversation. For an hour, no one talked with me. I did not use my phone. I just sat there like a rock. When we went home, no one walked with me. I feel extremely terrible that day and even vomitted throughout the night. I stopped attending the CCA for a while. No one messaged me to ask at all. Although I was there through thick and thin for the CCA, no one bothered to message me. I already knew that members messaged each other so I dont see any reason why anyone wouldnt message me. One day, I saw the girl from my CCA walk past me in the canteen. She clearly saw me but did not even wave or try to acknowledge me. My heart sank so hard that it probably came out the other side of the world. I gave up trying and just focused on studies.I graduated and realised workplace is not exactly a place to make close friends. The environment is very different and when shit falls, it is every man for himself. It was the worst.I still meet up with sec classmates and uni mates but I feel that they are just asking me to come because I was already in the group. Some just call me to feel better because they know I am not doing well career wise despite being good at studies. I would say my work problems and they would be grinning away because they have higher pay and do not need to deal with terrible bosses. I dont meet up with my jc classmates because for some reason they stopped calling me out. However, I still know that they are in contact because they post pics on fb. The guys in my jc clique did not even invite me to their weddings but almost the whole class attended the wedding, even the girls and guys from other cliques.I feel as though I was never truly anyone's friend. I never felt valued or appreciated as a friend. I wish I was not born with this background or this appearance. I know I should be proud of my background but it has caused me nothing be pain and suffering. I have never been able to share my feelings and thoughts with anyone. I never felt confident of myself ever. I always feel as though I am not good enough to even be friends with these people. It is as if I have to put in so much effort just to be able to sit and eat with them. They do not need to put in any effort. They even insult me and say whatever they want. If I try to defend myself, I lose the circle and have to sit alone. So, I just had to tolerate and tolerate and tolerate and tolerate. I feel like shit. I feel like I am constantly chasing but no one actually reaching back out to me.These feelings have been affecting me alot, especially the CCA one. It has been affecting me mentally and I can see the results. My studies was affected. My career was affected. My fitness has been affected. I just feel so lonely and depressed.-#98679: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98679","['Care: 50 people', 'Like: 31 people', 'Sad: 12 people']",27 comments,5 shares

Her temper tantrums will last upwards of over 3 days and will include a minimum 3 hour one-sided vicious rant at me. She is also in the habit of blocking my number whenever her temper tantrums kick in.We have been together for 3 years during which the abuse from her got much worse in the past 2 years. Recently in the past 2 months I have been telling her that she is really taking me for granted. The reason I say that is no matter how hurtful and spiteful her words are to me, I do not fight back and remain patient and nice to her, in the hopes that it will soften her anger. The sad thing is instead of her appreciating this, she will just double her efforts to yell at me and to hurt me further after seeing that I do not retaliate. She really drains my energy and my time.Today after she yelled at me and blocked me, I decided enough was enough and wrote an email telling her I wish to end our relationship.Is it normal to feel empty and perhaps even a sense of regret when one is leaving an abusive relationship?

98668,"Is it natural to be this indecisive and uncertain about one's future direction?I like research, and in the years after I graduated, I took on a research assistant job to prepare myself to do a PhD, and also to gauge if I truly like, and am able to handle the rigour that comes with it.Now, I am severely burnt out, and this is not because the work environment is demanding, but mostly because I can't formulate ideas without discussing with others, because I can't decide for myself which analysis is the best, because I doubt my writing skills...and all that spills into delays that eventually has me spent. I can no longer look at my work without blanking out and feeling inadequate anymore. I am probably the most unproductive staff. This is no way a researcher should be like - they can seek inputs from and work with others, but are very able to work independently. They try and fail a lot, but get back up most of the time. They are highly motivated by their curiousity, and this lets them be very perservering.I have concluded that maybe, I am just not suited for research as a lifelong career. I don't want my interest to be extinguished just like that.But these traits are also important in other areas, not just research. And without the skill sets/experience in other areas, sometimes, I wonder, would I be any different if I switched to another field? Am I just an incapable being that has little value to contribute to society and to myself? Do I need a break, or do I need to grow a spine?Some constructive advice on how to be less indecisive, and how to improve myself, would be greatly appreciated.-#98668: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98668","['Like: 21 people', 'Care: 10 people']",20 comments,6 shares

A friend is interning in a well known hotel in that has rich history.Shocker that the management does not allow them to wear a jacket even if they feel cold because it will cover the uniform. Many people who worked there including customers have said that it is so cold. The air conditioning vent start to drip water / grow mould because of how bad the situation is. Wearing t-shirt underneath is also not an option as they also will be reprimanded.

98666,"hi guys, F22 here. I have gotten together with my boyfriend in University and it has been going pretty well. He cares for me and will go out of his way to buy me simple treats whenever I am feeling stressed due to my workload and commitments. Boy, he loves to have sex with me and I don’t mind his enthusiasm as I find it pretty cute and think of it as a time for bonding . His sex drive is pretty high( maybe about 3 times a week) and I try my best to accommodate him as long as I am able to finish my school tasks first. Sometimes when we are out on a date, he would ask for a quick one and we will just get the deed done in the toilet of a mall, it’s quite thrilling and we would be often starred at by strangers outside the handicap toilet when we are leaving.I have found out that he has a folder of obscene materials stored in his phone and it consist of leaks/video of women from school and I don’t know what to feel about it…I mean, I do understand that men have their tendencies and needs to satisfy. But I don’t really like to mentally picture my bf masturbating to other women. I have mentioned it to him casually and I have told him to record our acts together and masturbate to it  instead. I even sent him multiple videos of myself dressed like a little slut while masturbating and calling for his name but he would always delete my videos and tell me to stop doing it as he doesn’t want our videos to be leaked/ hacked. Do you guys have any words of advice for me ? I just want to feel loved by him fully and the thought of him jerking off to other women tend to upset me quite a bit-#98666: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98666","['Like: 70 people', 'Haha: 61 people', 'Wow: 13 people']",87 comments,36 shares

She was outraged when she knew about our secret staycation and wants him to stop contacting me. Anyway, she did not like it when they were dating already but I did not know about the feelings hence I always thought whatever we do is fine. I insist of sitting beside him on his wedding as the session was for friends and his family wasn't there. At first, the wife was strongly against it but in the end as we insisted, I still sat beside him but he did not accompany me as he promised as he was so busy with other people and keep sticking with the bride.

98661,"The tech industry in Singapore and Computer Science is now at the top of the food chain and the forefront of development. It can be said that CS and Tech are the king of all jobs right now. Computing students have both the money and the power, they earn a lot and are generally respected by our society. This is just a small but true story to demonstrate why the tech industry is blooming:My younger brother (born 1995) have just graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering at NUS. However, instead of going for the traditional ME role, he self-taught everything about programming and software engineering, signed up for CS modules as his UEs, and worked remotely for a mid-tier American company for 2 years. He went to class in the morning and went online for only 3 - 4 hours every night to have his works done, earning an official net monthly salary of 3600 USD - or about 4800 SGD. But the main income actually comes from the freelance and commissioned outside projects - completing 1 to 2 of these every week and he could easily earn 9k - 10k SGD in total without paying any additional dollar of tax. After working for nearly 3 years, he now owns a car and a large condominium in Orchard.Almost every girl are infatuated whenever they hear about IT guys and software engineers. There is this girl studying oversea in Australia, coming back here in Singapore to work and was referred by her older sister to work at the same bank. For some unknown reasons, when my younger brother goes to that bank and doing some transactions, he got both the girl and her elder sister at the same time, and all three started to live with each other in my younger brother's condominium. The two sisters are hailed from a relatively wealthy and prestigious family, with the father being a university professor and the mother working as a civil servant for the government. When the parents first heard about the news of all three of them living together, they are quite angry and threaten to disown the two sisters. However, after hearing that my younger brother works in the tech industry, they completely changed their attitude towards him. They called and inquired him almost every week, giving him gifts and doing everything to push him to marry their precious daughters as quickly as possible, so as not to miss on the opportunity. My younger brother should have married the elder sister this month, but due to Covid-19 restrictions and some other issues, they have been delaying their wedding ceremony.-#98661: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98661","['Haha: 735 people', 'Like: 127 people']",279 comments,288 shares

98657,"I don’t understand why some people I know, who are from wealthy families, with the talent/resources to go to top schools like RI/RJC, and then to top universities, choose to come back to “work for their parents,” but really they just become managers of their parents’ accumulated wealth.I know at least 2 schoolmates from RJC who have taken this route. After RJC one of them went to Northwestern and the other to UPenn. They both studied topics related to politics and economics, and would have gotten excellent training for careers in the public service. I thought they were both heading in that direction. They were very smart, and were “big-picture” people. i.e their interests are rather LKY-esque, or Tharman-esque. 2-3 years ago, both of them came back to Singapore and both decided to work for their “family businesses.” At least that was what they told me. But I know for a fact that for at least one of them, their family no longer owned a business because they sold their business when we were in high school. What I’m guessing they have is probably a lot of money or assets to be managed. I feel like we have a lot of these people in Singapore. Families with very talented and well-prepared children who don’t feel the need to contribute to society. It is their prerogative, but sometimes I wonder how much talent is wasted when the descendants of well-resourced families are being hidden away in Bukit Timah, basically doing nothing.-#98657: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98657","['Like: 30 people', 'Haha: 19 people']",54 comments,4 shares

98652,"Here's a little story that I really need to get off my chest and hopefully get advice on...A little background on myself is I used to be the bubbly and happy-go-lucky figure among my friends and colleagues. I loved to keep myself occupied with motivational podcasts on a daily basis and be seen as motivated and energetic all the time. I am an extrovert (or was).These days, I'm just laying at home (unemployed), mentally torn, and struggling to make sense of what is to come.Well, the thing is, I have been emotionally scarred due to verbal abuse from my parents back during my primary and secondary school days. I often received criticisms, discouragement and got mocked by them when I share about my daily activities/achievements. Naturally, I turned to bottling things up from JC onwards which eventually took a toll on my mental and emotional health. And in fact, I barely remember my family having any constructive discussion on well-being or anything (be in about education, relationship, or finances)It doesn’t help that I was physically abused by my elder sibling since young which soured our relationship as we grew older.To make matters worse, I was admitted to IMH a few years ago and was diagnosed with a mental illness. Been in and out of hospital since then. This hasn’t been a surprise to me but I would have loved to avoid it. People around me assumed it was due to stress from uni which resulted in the episodes. Yet deep inside, I felt that it was a problem that had compounded since childhood and only exploded when it was too much to contain.I have my friends. But at the same time, I seldom reveal my emotional despair to others. I do not open up to people easily partly due to the strained experiences since childhood.  It has also affected my relationship with my previous partners as I couldn’t get comfortable with being vulnerable to them.At this point, everything is still taking a toll on my mental and emotional health. The current covid environment isn't helping because it feels so cold and lonely in my family with little interaction.I don’t really know what advice to seek but I think it would be beneficial to know how I can overcome the emotional scarring and how I can lead my life moving forward?-#98652: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98652","['Care: 15 people', 'Like: 4 people', 'Sad: 2 people']",0 Comments,12 comments

98623,"Possibly Aromantic/Asexual guy here.For the past 20+ years of my life, I never felt any connection or desire towards anybody , except to this girl that I got to know and had a nice connection with for quite some time.We are quite intimate and I was there for her throughout her ex-toxic relationship. I thought for sure that we had something going on. She was still pretty close to me even when she got out of her toxic relationship but she entered into another one before I had a chance to confess to her. I confessed to her anyway but got rejected because she said she wanted to try out her current relationship , but we remained friends.Her relationship was pretty shaky because she was the one who chased after the guy and from what I and our group of friends can tell, the guy was probably just stringing her along. Initially I was quite reluctant , but I was supportive and encouraged her to keep on trying even when they had fights and almost broke up.Fast forward a few months, I can see that it was clear that the guy is just playing with her and taking her for granted. I tried to intervene and made it clear that I dislike her current guy for basically taking her for granted and not giving her back as much as she gave him in that relationship. From this point onwards, everything went downhill and she gives me the cold shoulder, making it clear that if I cannot accept the boyfriend, she would not even be friends with me.The thing is, even till now, it is still pretty obvious that the guy is stringing her along with no concrete plans to be with her in the future , and she choose to live on in this dream of her, instead of actually talking it out with him to stop wasting time. I would be happy for her if her relationship happens to take a good turn and she ends up happily ever after, but with things going this way, I doubt the guy would stay with her for long.I would not mind waiting for her to be single again and try to chase after her, but in the mean time, what would be a good way to mend our relationship when I cannot stand the sight of her ""player"" boyfriend. Also, as mentioned, I am possibly asexual/aromantic , so I am not going to look  for another relationship to get over her anytime soon. I also have plenty of hobbies and a decent job , so I am actually fine/happy being single , had been doing that for the past over 2 decades.It just feels so wrong to see her trying so hard and sacrificing so much of her time and money to keep that guy around, and he barely does anything in return and possibly just pocketing her.-#98623: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98623","['Like: 10 people', 'Haha: 8 people', 'Care: 3 people']",24 comments,1 share

He is quite sweet, matured thinking and decent looking, he shared that he had a past rs for about 4.5 years, had bto and proposed (ex-gf accepted) but change of heart after acceptance and they broke up for a year now. Is this a red flag? I am inexperienced in this and was wondering something must have went wrong between them for a rs to end abruptly after so many years.

98614,"Hi, I heard I can get good advise here. I am really a bit disturbed and need some advise.I have known my boyfriend for almost 2 years and he is very understanding. He respects the boundaries I have set knowing that virginity means a lot to me. A lot of my friends told me that since he is a guy, he surely must be getting his needs satisfied elsewhere. I refused to believe them because he has always cared for me and been very nice to me. At times, I wanted him to take off his tshirt and feel my body against his naked chest. But he had politely declined saying that he will keep it for after marriage since he may get turned on. He told me that this way he can keep me as a virgin like what I wanted. Then one day, I stayed over his appartment and I was watching television while he was in his room on his bed. I decided to pop in. I saw him quickly hide something under the pillow. My heart skipped a beat. Was he cheating on me? Was he texting other girls?. He seemed very nervous and told me I should have knocked on the door. In any case I sat and we kissed and chat a little. He said he needed to go and get something to drink and led me to the living room. He asked me to wait there while he went to Starbucks.My mind was still curious. So I went to his bedroom and searched under the pillow and to my shock it was Kinohimitsu Bust Up Drink! And it was empty! ""Gosh! Dont tell me he is drinking that!"" I thought. I searched his room and found a carton of it. I also found fenugreek tablets. As if it was not enough I found a pump that makes those humps bigger. My heart sank. Now I understand why he had never taken off his tshirt even when swimming. He said he wants to respect that women are in the pool as well. Now I understand why he did not seem so thrilled when I wore a skimpy top at his place. He does seem a little bigger there. Don't tell me he looks the same up there as me? I quickly left the room and when he returned, I pretended I did not know anything at all.Can anyone tell me how I can even ask him about this? I love him but now I am lost. Is he even interested in women?

98613,"I just have some problems about communication with my mother. Since young, my brothers and I were educated by dictatorship, it's just like my mum will keep forcing us to accept her words and opinions. Such as...when I wanted to study dentistry, she said no not because of the fees but she said it doesn't suit female as female are not skilled in this and that, besides only studying in India will make you to be a good doctor/dentists bla bla bla... or she will try to be very hard in forcing us to accept what she wants to do to make us accept her such as you see i don't do what others do , they are a lot more harsher than me... no matter how i try to immitate her and explain to her how you feel right now is exactly how i feel right now...but still she's still thinking she's right, but i feel very stressful. I have almost suffered from depression when I was studying in A levels just because she kept deducing me for not studying whenever I went home from dorm every weekends when i locked myself in my piano room to practise piano just because I was not only doing my A levels but also my LTCL exam, but I felt very bad just because she kept scolding and blaming me in this way just like I'm really lazy and not doing hard enough when she never noticed how hard i had been studying at school, after school every weekends, though i know she's just having lack of security...just because of her harsh views and opinions, everyone in my family have been compromising her for more than 10 to 20 years just because she can never give in no matter in life, in our education choice, in our life choices and a lot more... I do understand she's trying to be a good mother from the way she wants just because she lost her mother when she was born and she was trying to give us everything and anything she didn't able to get since young. I know she loves all her kids very much. I have to admit I can endure more insults, judges and bad words from others more than my peers. I do understand that she's just saying out however by repeating this everyday including what i buy and eat everyday just like parrot really makes me stressful...I told her many times can you please don't repeat everyday and I have remembered and i don't buy those food anymore just because you think it's not good to eat too frequent just because I really feel like her way of talking really makes me feel like blaming me for buying this and that and not taking care of myself well and i know she's just trying to express her care to me... but I really feel stressful whenever i try to talk to her well until I don't even know how to communicate correctly with her anymore. [Reason: I'm in Singapore while my parents are in Malaysia and I do share what i do and eat to them everyday so they know how I'm doing when they can't see me] However, what I care is also about my mental health. Sometimes, when i talk to her and whenever she sounds like educating me again ( though i know she is trying to give me care) those memories including how much i have endured and how i hurted myself in the past maybe now as well would make me more emotional and she will keep saying that I'm now against them...though I'm not...I feel like being kidnapped morally when she always tries to use how other kids won't do to their parents which makes me guilty until it will make me losing control by hurting myself (biting myself, crying for one whole day even weeks, and so on) when I am full of bad emotions. This really affects me a lot in making friends as well as how my friends treat me may also lead me to face such extreme emotion as well. I don't even feel like exposing to others as telling out is rather useless...it's like...i feel no one is standing on my side when I'm educated to compromise though i do understand expecting understanding is never possible. Besides, my mum will also blame me for being silly enough just because i hurted myself in the past...it's like depression doesn't exist in this world and it's impossible for mr to have depression which, in fact, nearly engulfed me. I can never forget those days when i hid in my room and cried and hurted myself in the past, and maybe occasionally for now. Everyone in my family including my aunts(my mum's sisters) my cousins(who grew up with her) and a lot more have been asking me to compromise her...just compromise her. This is how i have been educated to give in since young just to stop quarrelling at home and by just to be a giving person. However, I really cannot take it anymore...I do understand she's my mother who take cares me a lot...and i do understand as a kid, i should treat her well and follow her will. However, her illogical way of thinking and mindsets on judging me really makes me feel inferior as I don't even know how much effort should I do in order to get her satisfy... I do accept her point of view that competition will trigger us to work harder and stay stronger in work field, however, I don't think my mental is healthy. It's like ... I don't even know what can I do anymore... so what should I do? What can I do to communicate properly with her?-#98613: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98613",['Like: 7 people'],0 Comments,27 comments

98584,"To those who felt that you are at the stage if talking about settling down instead of breaking up with your boyfriend or girlfriend who doesn't seem to be the right one, trust me, it's never too late. It's better to break it off now instead of marrying the wrong one. I am a 过来人. I was 28 (F) when I broke off with my then bf of 3 years. We already talked about marriage, applied for BTO, planned for our future wedding dates, etc. Everyone thought that we will definitely get married one day. But others don't see what's really happening between us. He is a smart guy, with high paying job and constantly given praises by people around him. Basically he is like the Mr Perfect in everyone's eye. He was the one who chased me. When we first got together, we felt like we complement each other. Eventually, it started to become me chasing after his perfection. Like because he is this perfect, I need go be as perfect. And no, he didn't tell me it is ok to be who I am cause that's who he really loves, he expects me to be as perfect as him. He finds me watching drama, reading blogs all these as wasting my time away (PS: I only do it once I'm done with my work). He always talk on the phone about work and when I commented that I didnt get enough attention from him, he said at least he is doing something that earns money and not laze around. But I was in love. Afterall, he is the Mr Perfect and everyone tells me how I should not lose him. Then it started to take a toll on my mental health, crying to sleep everynight cause I felt like I was never good enough. I communicated the issues with him and he didn't feel like he has any wrong. Eventually, we decided to go on our separate ways, and gave up on our BTO. The rs was so painful that it took me 2 years to decide that I need to start opening my heart again. Went on some dates (dating app) and went on a few dates with those I thought we have chemistry when talking via app but ZERO chemistry when we met irl. At 33 years old, I met a guy via mutual friend. We hit off instantly. I really enjoyed talking to him. He is not perfect.. not well educated, earn less than me, slightly shorter than me, few years younger than me. To put it bluntly, people would say he ""pick until gold"" if I ever agree to be his gf. I shared with my friends that I was interested in him and none of my friends felt that we can work out cause he is too different from my previous Mr Perfect style. But I went ahead to agree to be his gf within one month after knowing him. And fast forward, I am 37 year old now. He proposed to me after we were together for only 3 months cause he felt like I am the one for him, just as how I also told him I felt like he is the one for me. We got married 10 months after getting together. We are going to celebrate our 3 years wedding anniversary soon and our first son came out just last year. Couples can be together for 10 years and still breakup while couples who are tgt for 10 days could meant for ever. Length of rs does not determine how successful the rs will be. It could be 10 years old quarrel or 10 months of working towards being one. So it is never too late to break up with the wrong one. I thought I was gonna be single for life but my soul mate appeared when I was no longer looking. It may be late but it's better than suffering all my life being with the wrong one. Don't ever decide your life based on society norms. Do what you think is best for you and your mental health. Ask yourself what makes you happy and do all the happy things when you are single. Share those happy moments when you meet your future soul mate down the road and eventually share more happy moments when you find the one.

98581,"After my many failed relationships, as a 29 year-old, I have come to a point in my life where the only trait I really hope for is loyalty. As a young NUS student, having had no relationship experience, I longed for the thrill of an exciting relationship, for a guy who would sweep me off my feet. My first boyfriend fit the description almost too well. He'd buy me chocolates when I'm on my period, flowers on my birthdays. He'd take me out on fancy dates, spending way more than I know he can afford; and he'd repeat to me how much he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. This carried on for months. But his infatuation with me soon faded, and he had been flirting with another girl for 3 months before I finally broke it off with him.I've had a total of 3 relationships, all of which ended in the same tragic way.Now that I'm almost 30, I realized that all I really want now is security. To have someone I can go home to every day, with whom I don't have to worry about how I dress, or how I speak, or how I behave. Someone who will always take my side. Someone who just listens to me without trying to change me. Someone who wouldn't get bored or sick of me even as I slowly age into an old woman. I want someone who is just there for me, all the time, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want someone who's willing to commit to be the lifelong partner for me as my dad has been to my mom.

And definitely, marriage is something we have discussed too. It is just not too soon as we are not really financially stable yet. However our view on having a child is different. I am not keen to have a child as the financial burden and commitment are huge. Given the society now, it is very hard to raise a child. My wish is to have a dog and live happily with my partner. I know some people have the thinking that a family is only complete with a child. But I think a marriage can be happy without a child too. On the other hand, my boyfriend wishes to have at least one as he feels a child signifies the bond and love between the two of us. This is something that has been troubling me as I know our ultimate goal has to be the same. My partner said he is ok to accommodate me but I do not want him to be unhappy too. What should I do? Should I give in and probably give a chance? On a side note, I do love kids a lot especially my nieces and nephews. I just feel being a mum requires a lot of commitments and I am not ready.

98571,"My bf of over a year (1 year and 3 months to be exact) had broken my trust due to him apologizing without changing his behavior almost a year into our rs when I opened up to him about how I felt neglected and not listened to. (Our 'conversations' consisted of practically just hellos and goodbyes, even during weekends. There were also a few instances where he just ignored me when I really wanted his reassurance, something that I have brought up before, although I understand he was busy with uni stuff, but when I asked him when it could be talked about, I just got ignored.)Long story short: I felt really neglected. Felt like he didn't care about me. Communicated my needs to him several times. He apologized and promised to change his behavior, nothing changed. I gave him lots of chances. Nothing changed. Trust in him is shattered. It hurt me a lot. I really wanted out. I told him that and gave him an ultimatum. He apologized for taking me for granted and told me he would make time for me etc., he begged me to give him one last chance. I gave him that chance. I'd say he's doing a little better, but part of me is scarred from the whole thing of giving him the chances in the past. It seems like worries, doubts and resentment had built up and I keep thinking why he didn't treat me better earlier on, why it had to result to me giving him an ultimatum before treating me better. To this day, I still keep on thinking what I am to him, even though he's treating me better, I don't think my trust in him has returned. I'm not sure if it can be restored to the way it was. It's like the ghost of the past, rather, the memories of the past keeps haunting me. How he treated me in the past replays in my mind, and whenever I remember it, I just cry. It really hurt a lot. People always equate trust to that of a shattered mirror, where regardless of how much you try to pierce it together, the cracks will always show. He said he's determined he will earn it back, and that he really wants and loves me, he's showing it in his actions, but I'm honestly scared that I'd get hurt like that again. It seems like I've been scarred. I'm not sure if I trust him. Yes, I love him a lot, but .. I'm not sure if I trust him, if he could earn back my trust, if our rs would to back to the way it was before he had broken my trust, if there will come a time when the doubts in my mind would clear up, when I would feel secure with him..Is it possible for someone to earn one's trust back when it's been thoroughly broken several times? Would there come a time when the doubts, the worries, the fog in my mind would clear up regarding why he took me for granted in the first place etc.?

98569,"Need some advice here.My bf and I have been together for  almost 2 years but he still doesn’t trust me. Before you go on to say that he doesn’t trust me because of something I did, no I didn’t cheat or do anything even close to cheating. Throughout the past 2 years, I have been 100% loyal to him. No odd messages or unnecessary one on one meet ups with the opp gender. He knows every single one of my friends (I usually keep to a small circle of friends) and I tell him everything. I meet him almost everyday and we video call (instead of voice call) so there is literally no secrets between us.Before him, I’ve had exes and serious dates and so I’m more sexually experienced than him even though he’s older than me. Is it reasonable for him to feel that I have the tendency to sleep around just because of that? I don’t. So now every time I go out to drink with my friends (which is prolly like once in 3 months), he gets all upset. I had drinks with my colleagues the other day and ended up vomiting because of excessive yakult. Yes, my yakult soju’s ratio was prolly 3 yakult to 1 soju. So I texted him “I vomited :(“He didn’t respond and only said “rest well b” the next morning. Turns out he got mad at me because of that vomiting saga and was having second thoughts about our bto plans. Wtff. I showed him the messages in my group chat where my colleagues apologised for leaving me to clean up alone because I was the only one conscious and yet he remained upset about me drinking. I do love him but I’m getting sick and tired of his insecurity. I feel like I have done everything to make a guy secure and Idk what more can I do to help the situation.

98556,"Pardon my Grammar. 27 year old female. Recently I have saved up enough to invest in a ukelele and finally learn how to play ukelele which I have wanted to learn for more than 2 years. Have been telling my SO, whom I have dated for many years, that I wanted to purchase a ukelele to learn how to play a ukelele several times for about a year whenever we talked about music as I was excited about learning how to play a ukelele. Throughout all these conversations, he has never mentioned that he knows how to play a ukelele nor owns one. Now that I have enough money to buy one for myself and also going to spend on a few other items, he suddenly tells me that he has a ukelele out of the blue and wants to lend it to me. I feel bad about it and thinks that he is still playing on his ukelele frequently to destress. How do I nicely tell him that without hurting his feelings that I love him and I want him to still have his ukelele with him at all times so he can destress and I would buy my own and self learn since he has not offered to teach me nor does he has the time to.-#98556: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98556","['Like: 16 people', 'Haha: 11 people', 'Care: 4 people']",36 comments,2 shares
98555,"I am the OP of #98475I see alot of pp bashing me because i don't give mthly allowance and my mom waived off my tuition fee from her cpf. For context that i didn't see a need to elaborate (since it was just to explain to the original requestor the starting pt i was on), i wanted to pay off the lump sum tuition fee to my mom's CPF (i accumulated enough within a year) and for the first year i was providing allowance on a mthly basis (market rate). My mom however, feels that waiving off the amt in CPF and getting it in cash instead was better for her since she preferred cash and it would remove interest for me ( win win). In addition, she herself preferred the option that i saved the money and grow it such that i can pay for their subsequent hospital bills/home needs instead of a lump sum payment to them to spend as they wish.My parents refused when i wanted to get them insurance because they were adamant that its a ""scam"" despite me talking to them multiple times and getting agents to try and convince them. Also they have health issues which does not have insurance providing adequate coverage in their current age, as advised by the agents. Oh and why we have a bad relationship? Because my parents were physically abusive and i was hospitalised multiple times, yes, even when schooling. And yeaps, no allowances from them, i'm expected to earn it myself. In addition, the allowance i provided monthly was spent off gambling within a week ( yeaps the whole sum). Hence, after discussion with my mom, its best that i pay direct for what they need as and when they need it.So yes, get off your high horses and stop being salty. To those saying i have a headstart, woah, Nope i didn't. I worked throughout uni to support myself and minimise burden on my parents.So yea, less judgemental nonsense and more hustling instead. Maybe instead of trying to be keyboard warriors with an over inflated, over imaginative, salty mindset... it would be good to realise not everyone feels the need to go into details about their family dynamics. Since so many want to make assumptions, then i will clarify it and i hope, in your daily life, instead of choosing to bash others without the full story, do things more constructive instead and of course,More understanding, less judgey. And yes, my parents no complaints about it and even suggested it to me, no idea why others so salty.-#98555: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98555","['Like: 24 people', 'Love: 2 people', 'Care: 2 people']",17 comments,1 share
98553,"Is it normal to not be ready to enter a relationship? I'm already 30 years old this year. I admit that I have this deep suspicion that I'm gay. Whenever I see guys outside with good physiques and looks, my gaze would linger on just a bit longer to admire them. I sometimes do fantasize having a relationship with a guy, but that's about it. I simply can't imagine myself being in a relationship with anyone. At first I thought that it was my parents that I'm worried about. They are conventional, and would definitely not take it that easily when they find out that their son is sexually unconventional. This was what I thought impeded me from entering a relationship. Because I would rather die alone and single than to fake a relationship with a lady. It's just unfair for both of us, more for the lady. Yet gradually, I realised that I might be the reason why I'm not getting into a relationship. Sometimes I think that interacting with others can be tiring, but other times I find myself longing for companionship. It's this see saw type of feeling that makes me all the more confused. So am I this, or that? Do I want to commit to a relationship, or do I just yearn for one just for the sake of it? Here's what I did to test out myself. I sieved through my past experiences with my friends. What I found out was that most of the time, I'm reluctant to make the first conversation, take the first move, or propose something first. Also, I would become very uptight when I'm with someone, even with people I know well. It's like there is a control in me that is holding me captive, and I can only be my actual self in my own room at home. Even in front of my family, I would put on a semi facade, and only remove it once I'm in my own safe space. Yes, it gets tiring, but somehow I got used to it. It's similar to taking off your mask when returning home from work. You finally get to breathe some air.

My concern is that there are taxes (30%?) associated with investing in USD... does it make better sense to stick to SG market? Also, I am unsure what is the best platform to use for these transactions. Currently using online broker (moo moo/tiger) for S&P500 and VXUS, and OCBC BCIP for the Nikko ATM STI. I'm concerned if online broker is safe and cost-effective in the longterm.Finally, am I allocating too much of my budget to investment? Should I continue to save money in the bank for my short-term goals (next 8-10years) (house, car, etc).Please pardon my noob questions. I'm reluctant to talk with financial advisors as I always feel like they are trying to sell me their products... hence I turned to this platform.

98546,"To OP #98426: I guess I could share some advise/ experience as someone who has been in my family's company for a few yearsFor some context, I actually did not want to work in my family's business. But due to me not getting any offers, I felt I did not have a choice (my starting pay was average for a fresh graduate at the time). There will certainly be those that judge you for ""taking the easy way out"". But, at the end of the day, what matters is that you make the best choice for yourself. I count myself lucky that my closest friends understand and accept the decision I have made (they also do know some of the issues I have faced in my workplace, which leads them to be more understanding). I know it's hard. There are people who accuse me of flaunting privilege sometimes when I just talk about family. One of my largest reservations back when I was 25 was how I would be perceived for working in my family's company (I actually cried when I realised that I was going to be working in my family's company).Working in one's family company certainly has its perks. As you have alluded to, you would be exposed to management, a valuable skill whether you choose to stay on in your family's company or leave in the future (This is coming from someone who has contemplated leaving my family's company on several occasions, so never say never). You also get more exposed to different aspects of business, again something a regular employee would not get. On the other hand, the politics can really be a pain. Company politics has a completely different dynamic once family becomes involved. It's one the biggest reasons I have contemplated leaving my family's company.There can also be awkwardness between you and colleagues due to them knowing you are the boss's kid. I guess the simple advise I can give would be to treat everyone nicely and not ""flaunt privilege"". It was awkward between me and some colleagues initially; but things have improved significantly, with some sharing information with me that they would not share with the bosses.All in all, I do not regret joining my family's company. As mentioned earlier, there are those who would judge me. However, their opinions don't matter to me as I had made the best decision for me. As someone who does not understand the way your family/ family company works, it would not be appropriate for me to try and convince you which direction is better for you. All I would advise is tune out the noise and the judgement from those who don't matter and make the best decision for yourself. Hope this helps you. Wishing you all the best in whichever path you choose!-#98546: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98546",['Like: 11 people'],3 comments,2 shares
98544,"Ok i just need an avenue to speak and express some stuff. So far NUSWhispers has been a great place to do so. Some background, when i was younger my mom used to cane me a lot. Theres never a month that went by where i wouldnt get canned because i was either rude to my father or cause i did smt stupid in public. Its usually the former because my rs with dad was terrible, mostly due to my parents’ bad rs. I still preferred my mother more because i knew she was the breadwinner of my family. I know she felt bad for hitting me but she doesnt know how else to parent me. Once shes cooled down she usually buys me things like food i like. (This ended up with me now having very bad relationship with money, and fear of commitment to woman. I cant love properly) besides the point tho. So when i was 5/6, because of the cannings, i thought if my mom could do that to me, i could do that to anyone who irritated me right? No one told me i couldnt. So one day my helper didnt relent to one of my request for a small thing i wanted and i went to find my mom’s cane. I tried to hit her. I dont remember her being afraid of me and i just knew i was genuinely having fun because i thought my mom was having fun when she hit me. So i told my helper to go hide under the kitchen sink. I wanted to play hide and seek, while i was holding the cane. Idk why she didnt stop me because she was more than twice my size. I was a fat kid though but still. Its so screwed up that i, a kid forced a grown woman who is tryna make a living in a foreign country, under a sink, and threatened her with a cane because i learnt it from my mom. My helper didnt say anything to my parents. Next morning all her belongings were gone. She left the house in the middle of the night, went to the police, and my parents were apparently facing charges in court. On hindsight thank god she did what she did. She didnt hit me, and she left right away to the police. Had she said anything to my parents maybe they would have made her stay. Dont attack my parents cause they’re nice normal people just that they hit their kids to parent them. This was 18 almost 20 years ago. Im a grown man, tbh i still think im a teenager cause i still in uni, but still. Im confronted with this memory and i really feel terrible. Im disgusted.

98535,"I always admired people to whom science and math come naturally to them. I really love the physical sciences, but I've always been mediocre at them. I can watch documentaries about physics for hours and hours, or proof-writing lectures for hours and hours. I understand them perfectly when they are presented and explained to me, but whenever I am expected to do problems, to write proofs, I choke. I'm from a very wealthy family and I have had all the resources to be a great STEM student. I never succeeded. Oddly enough, I was always really good at the humanities. I was a HP student at both HCI and HCJC. I have a degree in Ethics, Politics, and Economics from Yale, and I'm currently doing a dual JD/MPA degree at Columbia. Law and public administration was never really my calling, but since I've always been good at these topics without much effort at all, I stuck to them just out of pragmatism. I've always put my mediocrity in STEM down to pure laziness. I am really lazy to a fault, which is probably a symptom of my having being born with a lot of privilege. For some reason, when it comes to history, or social studies, or politics, or economics, everything just comes naturally to me without much of any studying at all. It almost seems like I have an eidetic memory for readings in the social sciences, but I can't seem to replicate the same ability/aptitude that I have for the social sciences with STEM disciplines. As I grew older, I started to realize that my lack in aptitude in STEM cannot just be a manifestation of my lack in effort, but it must be because of my lack in intelligence. Even though I will be graduating soon, qualified as a lawyer and a public policymaker, I can't get over the fact that I could not for the life of me figure out how to do well in theoretical physics, in pure math, and in advanced computer science (even though I'm great at econometrics and data science). I guess I'll just have to keep admiring people like Prof Ben to whom STEM comes as easily as pie.-#98535: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98535","['Like: 28 people', 'Haha: 3 people', 'Care: 2 people']",18 comments,3 shares

98501,"OP of #98454 here. I decided to give him one more chance aka one more date and fetch me from home and back afterwards. This time he drove law by law, so I was totally OK with it now. Its just that I noticed he yawned a few times while driving, so after arriving at the restaurant I decided it was my turn to ask if he was okay and use the opportunity to dig more bout his driving habits and history.He was forthcoming with me and confessed in me laughingly that he crashed twice in his first 2 years of his 7years of driving, and both times was in slow start stop jam type of traffic where he dozed off at the wheel because he was tired after work. He also explain that actually he is aiming for maximum fuel mileage. then he went into a needy technical rant how about speed/RPM is directly proportionate to the mileage so he is trying to go as fast as possible with as low an RPM as possible and avoid braking. (how true is this? Comments? for cerato 2020 model is 13.5km/l good?) Once he mentioned it I did some recalling of that first drive, he really didnt accelerate quickly and didnt brake much, he reached the 140-160km/h mark gradually and its then when, to maintain that speed, he rather keep changing lanes than brake and before entering the spiral, I don't even think he braked, he just gradually slowed down and entered at 70-80km/h and maintained it thru.The ride back was safe and lawful as well but again I caught him yawning a few times. During the ride he also told me that after our discussion the last time he was driving law by law now even without me. But now I'm like errrmmm would I rather he drive slow and risk falling asleep and crash or drive faster and dun crash due to the adrenaline hmmmmm. Also it would be kinda awkward of me now to rescind my words after my energetic objection the last time.

I want to be your friend but you are making it so difficult. If you want to stop losing friends then do sth about yourself. I have mentioned this to you many times but you never change. I am trying but if you lose me at the end then you deserve it. I don't know who can stand you.Even his own parents cannot stand his nonsense talk. He can ramble on and on about nonsense stuff. My parents told me this no EQ friend is very shallow, stay away from him. Even my friends ask me why am I still friend with this guy. My friends cannot stand the way he talk and behave too.I don't like to give up on people. My current strategy is just to let my patience run out.-#98497: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98497","['Like: 6 people', 'Haha: 2 people', 'Sad: 2 people']",0 Comments,8 comments
98517,"Have seen some posts about local uni graduates looking down on those who came from private  universities. Although I graduated from a local university, I would say that my decision to enter one was more because my parents have the very same mindset and believe that I will not be able to find a job as easily if I did not graduate with a local uni degree. When in reality, private universities like SIM, Kaplan etc. offer a much shorter route and the endpoint is more or less similar - which is to get a degree. I have many friends who are of the same age as me but make a monthly income of around $800-$1000 more than I do even though they hold a private degree. That 2 year headstart that they get in their careers is worth more than the additional 2 years I spent in University, not to mention the extra school fees as well. A degree from SIM costs easily half as much as a local uni. And as times change, I can see that employers are also moving away from the stigma that local University graduates are better.-#98517: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98517","['Like: 22 people', 'Haha: 2 people']",0 Comments,3 shares
98491,"Regarding #98447Actually, I prefer it if companies ask algo questions instead of nonsense like ""What is your greatest weakness"" or ""Tell me an experience you managed a conflict in your team"". Personally, I am very good at this kind of algo interviews as compared to those kind of behavioral interviews considering how socially inept I am. Its also better than asking trivia questions like do you know what is a 2 way TCP handshake or how does your OS prevent deadlocking. At least with algo, you can derive it from first principles. It is better than those build a twitter clone with XYZ tech stack within 24hours as it doesn't take up hours of your time and can be outsourced anyways if you know the right people. You also don't have to watch youtube tutorials to figure out how to use the tech stack required for the interview. Algorithmic based interviews are just the cleanest and most effective imo.However, I do acknowledge that the issue with algo interviews is that they can be grinded to an extent. If I were the interviewer, I would probably come up with unique algo questions you won't be able to find on leetcode and require actual ingenuity. Maybe an IQ test would help as well.-#98491: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98491","['Like: 5 people', 'Haha: 4 people', 'Sad: 1 person']",11 comments,2 shares
98486,"Can anyone give me advice how to deal with an unambitious partner? Don’t get me wrong, my boyfriend is not some lazy bum who is jobless and sits at home doing nothing. We both have been working for 3 years and he is an executive at some MNC. We are currently earning about 4.5k each. He is an unambitious and lowkey guy at work who just does enough to keep his job but doesn’t aim for more. Once, his boss wanted to put him on the company’s leadership track but he rejected. He has also been approached by a headhunter offering him a higher paid but more intensive job and he rejected as well. The reason he gave is that he just wants an easy life at work (which he currently is) and doesn’t want more stress.  After work, he just comes home to relax and play games, netflix etc while I see some of my friends around my age who are taking part time masters/ online courses or doing side hustles etc. Character wise, he has everything a girl can ask for in a partner- kind, caring, fillial, humorous and considerate. But his unambitious side is really what kept bugging me. Given his credentials- FCH, high IQ, good ppl skills and he can speak well professionally, I know he has the potential to achieve so much more. Now he’s just putting his career on autopilot simply put. I know it’s hard to change a person’s nature but should I just accept him for who he is? I know that if I settle with him, I will always live with the idea that he could have achieved much more but never went out to.-#98486: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98486","['Like: 100 people', 'Haha: 35 people', 'Sad: 10 people']",169 comments,32 shares
98483,"Nus is indeed good based on its ranking and reputation. But in recent years, nus also known for its reputation of sexual offences and how the school deals with such cases. In all honesty, everyone knows NUS name isn't that outstanding anymore due to the sexual misconduct cases and i suggest you all to stay low and not make fun of others cos the tables can be turned. I myself come from NUS and have interned with students from other unis such as smu or even private unis. But I've seen for myself those coming from private unis also work just as hard and in fact they have very good working attitudes. So this may be the answer to some of your questions as to why some of private uni students land jobs that are from MNCs or FAANG while some of us don't.Just a tip for anyone who is reading, be it nus, ntu or smu or private uni students. Do change your attitude of looking down on others, cos you like it or not, in the working world, you have to work with diverse groups of people. Once you're in the company, no one cares which uni you are from but how your attitude amd character determines your promotion.

98479,"Hi, I do have a problem which may need some useful suggestions… I would appreciate for the help.Well 3 months ago… I wrote long essays for days just to ask my friend (let it be M ) some past events… which seriously upset me though I didn’t dare to tell him… in long essays… then M scolded me for it and blocked me…The reason it turned everything so toxic and in long essays is when we just knew each other… M really confused me… we both   talked every day and study together and eat together every day after M got my IG…. Non stop for months… M did do and say something which confused me, such as being too caring to me like scolding me when I forgot to carry extra cash for food, not informing him this and that, never informed him when I go and eat alone at school, would be very sad when I ignored him,(especially a day when M bought me a waffle and I turned down, M looked super disappointed, then when I alerted, I gave him a drink and told him I bought purposely in the morning. M was happy and excited and happily introduced his friends to me and said we will all be very good friends in the future, which further confused me), initiating physical touch… and some flirty things in messages… which really made me feel confused and not knowing how to treat him…reason that made me super imbalanced is M explained to me M and L are just friends when I saw they both always together after some times…but then allowing L to put the a photo where they hold each other’s hands L profile picture on a messaging app while talking to me everyday… that made me feel really inferior…and L told me they aren’t couple as well… which made me feel more disrespected… cuz I confessed M said M  still want to be single… when i tried to put down my pride and be just like usual before we fought last time… I still got cold shoulder… it’s like I need to initiate then he bothers, but then he would constantly put on something on ig story just nice when I feel bad by deleting messages…(main reason is I really feel sad but don’t feel like giving myself stress as well by thinking about it),our mutual friend (L) also told me M treats L in the same way ( I mean very nice and over caring) as well, but L did tell me M made her misunderstand before as well… I know I’m not right in not respecting him for writing long essay which he doesn’t like as well…whenever I deleted messages and disappeared awhile just bcuz I need to settle my emotions for having my own space cuz I don’t want to be confused but then I would turn out to be he thought I was angry with him for not getting any responses from him bah… but I do feel like being utilised as a toy without any explanations and apology as well… including he would just put something on IG whenever I feel like being isolated which further confused me… though I’m not sure whether it’s for me…and imbalances whenever thinking back those days when M could throw his tantrum to me when M felt unhappy about me… but I would just keep quiet and swallow everything for years until those things really engulfed me and affecting me for almost 1 year… that’s why I decided to ask M about all these (cuz I was too shy to ask so I just put in long essays)… then ended up being scolded cuz he thought long essays from me troubled him and he’s enough…and ghosted me…(every time when something happens M would do this and it makes me more panic… it’s like he’s not willing to communicate, usually my others friends are ok with this and they would be straight, but this one…)but yet I still don’t know how should I do… am I too childish and irritating? Should I put down my pride again and send him what I think which would again hurt me again? Am I really wrong at taking old things that made me feel depressed even until affecting my life by asking him why( I am not blaming him or arguing who is wrong, it’s just a self reflection)?But… if to move on… I would always have a thought “ am I wrong? Is it hurting to him?” I really have no idea on this friendship anymore…or should I just give up this friendship?

98468,"I used to have a ex who was very good to me, willing to splurge on me, treat me and my parents very well, treat me with love unconditionally but I had no feelings for him, I thought feelings are something that will fade over time or can be built upon. The only flaws that he has is that he is a little weird, he would usually fap himself and record it on his phone, previously talk to girls on dating apps very desperately when he was single and also walks around his own shop naked and videos it on his phone, also he likes to spend future money using credit cards and when he spends he is a very big spender, he will buy facial packages over 3k, go for staycations at W hotel, eat at Sentosa, rent sports car etc. He works for his family business and although his qualification is only a diploma holder, he has money to spend extravagantly bcos of his family’s wealth. I’ve tried to ask him to do other things and to improve himself in case his business fails one day but he refuses to improve since he already is comfortable with his golden spoon. Because of that, I left him and met my current husband. My current husband is worse, he has a lot of secrets that I didn’t know before I married him. He was the top sales and earning quite a lot when I knew him, very hardworking with a drive in life. But the only flaw is that his sexual drive is very high and he always forces me to do sexual things on him that I absolutely hate, but bcos I love him, I do it no matter how much I hate it. Fast forward, I got pregnant by him, and only realised that he was cheating on me way before I got pregnant. My parents are very traditional and forced me to marry him to keep the baby as I always wanted a baby and to settle down. I could not accept the cheating nor forgive him but bcos of the baby, i proceeded anyway. After marriage, I found out that he was also spending future money, often borrowing from friends family and loan sharks, and had this history since 10 years back. He also like to convince other people to invest with him (scammer) and has lost almost half a million of money that is not his and that he has to repay. His past history also shows that he likes to watch porn, and his google search shows that he has been to all those dirty massage place before. He has promised that he will change but keeps gaslighting me, habits are hard to change.I plan to divorce with him as my love for him is dying day by day being unappreciated by such a lousy guy. Sometimes, I regret breaking up with my ex and wonder if life would be different having a kid with someone I do not love but a comfortable life. But I would not do anything to change the fact that I love my child to the moon, and without my current husband, I would not have her. Bcos of that, he always threaten to take my kid away if ever we divorce. And he has never paid a single cent for the child expenses so far, only using his cpf for the delivery. Even for the wedding, it was paid by mostly my relatives side angbao. My family hates him to the core bcos he has borrowed money from me and my mum (around 20-40k) total but has paid only a little back. He has also been jobless for almost a year. Even still, I still see hope for him as he keeps lying to me. Recently I bto with him and to my surprise, got it. In the case if we divorce after 3 years, the house will be forfeited and my chances of getting a house next time will decrease. I’m thinking whether I should just tolerate and not talk to him and just treat him like a housemate and sell it after 5 years then divorce. But 5 years is a long time to tolerate and being gaslight or abuse by someone constantly, not being able to move on. He keeps asking me to see a psychiatrist, I feel like I have a slight issue but still can control my actions, after being abused for so long but I feel that his main motive is to make me prove that I’m mentally incapable of taking care of the child. My ex on the other hand bcos his parents divorce no longer has his golden spoon, has to find a job outside and rent his own flat (as I predicted). Was my decisions made wrong? I feel like it’s very hard for me to proceed on and be positive in life after going through so much in barely a year and my decision making process is often clouded with emotions. I hope someone can give me a right advice. What would u do if you are in my position? Bcos I really don’t know what to do anymore.. my husband is not contributing financially, and doesn’t even treat me nice now, and keeps asking for sex. He is only selfish and cares for his own needs.-#98468: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98468","['Like: 27 people', 'Sad: 16 people', 'Care: 13 people']",72 comments,14 shares
98467,"In response to #98422I believe this guy is misunderstanding something. When most normal Singaporeans refer to 'overseas universities' in comparison to NUS, they don't mean Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Oxbridge or whatever ivy our PSC/President Scholars are going to. Usually, they are talking about tier 2 overseas colleges which cater to the lesser people who were rejected by local universities and is going to such lesser overseas universities which are usually very expensive but unlike the true global elite universities, have somewhat subpar academic standards. From my personal experience coming from one of the so called 'elite' JC, in that environment, if you go to NUS or local universities, you are seen as kind of a failure, a person who cannot make it to the true elite ranks of Oxbridge or the Ivies. Personally, I still feel envy at my peers who is studying in those places while I am stuck here. I assure you, almost all Singaporeans know that those schools you mention are infinitely better than NUS. However, the Australian universities, or tier 2/3 US/UK colleges that people go to when NUS rejects them? Well, I think it is right to say, they really aren't the best. You mention the point of our ministers being educated in overseas colleges. This is true, but as I mentioned they went to the top elite global universities like Cambridge or Harvard, not some XXX State College. Also bear in mind that in the past, like 30-40 years ago when our ministers had their education, NUS was nowhere close to where it is today. To put it bluntly, it was a 3rd world university with 3rd world resources! A lot has changed since then and, if you see our parliament lineup as of late, the majority of the younger parliamentarians were from local universities like NUS or NTU.Lastly, I would like address the stigma of this private vs public university thing. Firstly, we cannot compare the situation in Singapore with the situation in USA. It is true that in the USA, their private universities are the best and most highly sought after. But that is due to their system and long history.  All the top private elite colleges have centuries of history and alumni funding. It is not easy to build a world class university in a matter of decades. The only reason why NUS/NTU are able try to compete is because they have a lot of backing and support by the government.  Do you think S*M or J*** C*** or whatever have that chance? Furthermore, even if they are offshoots of overseas colleges they are usually built with the incentive of raising funds for the parent college by relying on the brand name. Do you think that the UOL here is remotely close in standard as the UOL in the UK? Not even close! The cohorts are graded on 2 separate curves to begin with!So yes, I don't disagree with you that NUS is no where as good as the true big league overseas universities and I don't think anyone would disagree! Just that, I think you could be misunderstanding the divide over local vs overseas universities and what it really represents.-#98467: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98467",['Like: 23 people'],24 comments,3 shares

Seems strange that companies would want to drill you on ONE specific area of rather academic CS knowledge. Is this a case of monkey-see-monkey-do ? Similar professions like (traditional) engineering do not have this kind of weird interview process, and their interviews test more on stuff like past project experience, general people skills etc., which IMO, is a MUCH better predictor of success on the job.

98445,"I have a dilemma that I need to solve ... I broke off with my 5years long term relationship ex half a year ago as he was being mentally abusive to me, example if something doesn't goes his way he would shout at me although in his context he was just raising his voice. The relationship became very toxic and I decided to walk away from it as it was either break up or marriage if I were to continue staying on in this relationship. 4months after the breakup he had zero contact with me leaving me very much heartbroken as I was still very much in love with him. I tried moving on by going on dates and meeting friends constantly keeping my mind occupied but My parents being kpo and not yet over the fact we broken up as i never told them the bad things he does to me and thinking we are making a mistake decided to invite him over for a family gathering one day. Surprised that he agreed to come it was the first time in 2 months since we last spoken, we had a serious conversation and found out that both of us was not over but both was too scar to take a step forward to do anything.... emotions came pouring out both of us feeling vulnerable and alcohol to blame we spent the night together. But after that night I realised we can never be together as old scars will never heal and it would be a mistake a try again. A month later my friend decided to tell me about his feeling for me. He had been there for me since the last year of my relationship with my ex and In a way he was a shoulder I could cry on and always lent his ear for me to rant since whenever I want to complain about things to my ex or was upset he would tell me Im overreacting and just playing the pity card ????, still being with my ex I didn't think anything much of his action aside from him being a good friend. After thinking about it for awhile I decided to give it a go and just try out this relationship.. Overtime I grew to really loving him and loving the way he treats me although he doesn't have much compared to my ex but atleast he treats me well... when everything seems to be going well I was hit with a news that u was pregnant. And it was definitely my ex as I have yet to done it with him. I told him about it and instead of being mad or asking me to abort it he hugged me and told me everything is going to be alright and if I ever decide to keep it he will raise it with me like his own If I want to abort he will be with me throughout the whole process.  He asked whether do I want to tell my ex about it and what do I want to do.. part of me find that it's only right to tell him about this child yet a part of me thinks I shouldn't as I have no intention of raising it with him if I were to ever keep it, after all a child wouldn't just magically solve our problems. At the end of the day I decided to keep it with my boyfriend and to never let the child know about his real father but my plans got ruin when my ex found out about the kid and insist on marrying me and raising the child together saying it's his birth rights to do so as he is the biological father  and that things might change now he will change for me and the baby .. he wants to file a lawsuit if we don't agree and will do whatever legal means to gain rights over me and the child.  Am I doing the right thing for my child? Should the child really grow up with the biological parents ? Should I give him another chance for the sake of the child..... even if it means gambling my happiness away.  Saying my boyfriend can never give the child everything that he can as he is a lawyer with a high paying income and my boyfriend just earning an average income. The child will be better off being able to choose to go to any school he wants and go and expensive vacations having all the toys he desire in the world and not being held back just because mummy and daddy can't afford... with all this drama going on I'm slowly sinking into depression and thinking maybe I should just get rid of the problem... if the child is gone..all this problems will be gone....

98442,"To the guy behind #98346: i believe we are in the same situation and facing a scam. I've also matched with a guy on tinder and spoke for more than a month now. I've been on and off dating apps for years and thought ​finally there's someone that I could talk to for so long. I found it a little weird when he started introducing some investment trading thing. But for me, i never had interest so i brushed it off. Our convos went back to normal but somehow it will always go back to asking me to do it. He mentioned that it's for a better future and also at least we have a common thing that we are doing together. It's weird because there's so many things to do together so why he have to be so hung up on this. I took 2 days off talking to him and weighing out the different possibilites - whether this is a scam or not. My situation was more confusing because he wasn't using a business number and we actually spoke on the phone a few times. Decided to give myself closure by confronting him about this and tell him that i am not interested and i felt very pressured by him. I am okay to find out more and do it but not now when we are currently just internet pals. Why should i trust someone whom i dont even know in real life, especially since money is involved. Things sort of went back to normal but 2 days later, he brought it up again. I think it has been a little clearer to me now. Up till today, i have no idea how he looks like (only from his tinder pics), he doesn't seem to have any intentions of meeting up despite him being in SG. If he truly wants to date me as he claims, he would not force me to do this or at least will be okay to wait till i am comfortable enough. He was always patronizing in convos but i thought it was just guys being guys. But always more passionate and reply faster when talking about the investment shit. Even though up till now i still hope that he was real and genuinely wants to share something with me, but I think that confrontational talk was also a last chance that i gave myself to test him out. The girl in your case is not even in SG, so just continue keeping your guards real high. Don't download any scammy links they send, don't send the money. Don't do anything. 2 can play the game. If she is a real scammer, she won't be able to stay for long. Otherwise, just find someone else to talk to.

98421,"Hi everyone, I have some advice that I need. I am really at wits end on this matter.So I broke up 1 yr ago and now am single at 25.  I met someone recently and we clicked very well and are thinking of advancing. Both of us come from medium income family and only just started working in a non fix income job*. So the future is pretty uncertain. I’m fine with it because I was always the kind who who is willing to stand by my partner and build a future together but what my mum & best friend said made me a little worried.My mother and best friend kept saying that since I’m already 25, I should focus on finding someone by analysing them instead of letting feelings take front seat. And by that she meant to find someone who is richer. It is a luxury that im single at this age because I wont be blinded by young love. I do look at their character and all but somehow money isn’t my priority….Cos I had another guy who was interested in me and he, although just started working with not much money, he has a lot of potential inheritance from his parents and grandpArents (he is definitely getting the $$). However after going out with him previously I honestly do not like his habits and personality as a partner so I rejected him.My mum and best friend were disappointed in me. So I started reflecting on myself which is what I need advice on.Can I ask - am I too childish with my thinking? To want to build a future with a guy. That I don’t really judge if they are money “poor” at this point, that I believe with hardwork, one can always make it. Am I not being practical? Is there not enough time to build a future since im already 25 already? I’m really afraid of course that my partner doesn’t make it eventually…. ***and not that I rely entirely on him but I’ve heard so many divorces because it takes two people to raise a family. And of course who doesn’t want to have a good life?Please let me know your thoughts  thank you and stay safe.-#98421: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98421","['Like: 26 people', 'Haha: 7 people', 'Care: 4 people']",67 comments,4 shares
98420,"Do girls find it off-putting that their partners seem like their not doing anything but the fact is that their business doesn’t require a lot of traditional “hard work?”I work for my parents. They basically manage a relatively large portfolio of assets (think in the low tens of millions), mostly in real estate. These assets generate revenue, and over time, they appreciate. This business will be passed on to me in its entirety because I’m the only child. There’s really not much grunt work required in this business. Most of the work is done by hired lawyers, bankers, and accountants. There is some work to be done when we buy or sell assets, there is work to be done when tenants come and go, but these things are irregular. On most weeks, I seem like I’m not doing anything. Which is true, I’m not doing anything on most days.My girlfriend gets very pissed at me, for some reason, mostly for “looking lazy.” She is a nurse and she works very long hours for a substantially lower income and she somehow hates that I’m not doing the same. We live together already and I do all the chores at home. My question is do most girls actually need to see that their partners look like they are doing something important? i.e fiddling with the computer, making phone calls, going to meetings. Or is financial stability ultimately adequate? I chose to help my parents because it’s just simple math that I’ll make far more money running and growing the business than I will ever make if I were to get a 9-5 job.-#98420: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98420","['Like: 62 people', 'Haha: 24 people']",95 comments,20 shares

I'm just an average girl btw - average looks, weight, and actually single by choice (i value freedom a lot).Among this group of friends, I am probably the one from the most humble background so I don't have much to offer or show. While I'm not the kindest person, I always offer advice and listening ear to those who need it. I know most people don't do that.

Sometimes when she throws some comments, other friends will step in to stop her from going further. Anyway I don't really know what is the point of making those comments... She obviously doesn't dress up and she really isn't pretty. I mean you gotta at least be of certain calibre to make comments about others right? But of course I won't say such things in her face cos I don't want to be like her and don't want to ruin the friendship within our friend group.Just wondering if there's any solution to stop this.

98404,"Hi, “I would like to share my story with my encounter with a (I believe he is a well known) sexual predator- mr IC.I have known IC for many years but just as a hi- Bye acquaintance. When my family and I moved to sentosa, we ran into him more. Therefore , he knows my family- my husband and my kids. I am working in  insurance industry in Singapore and in June 2020 , he said he will open and an account with me . He asked me to go over to his place, saying that his wife does not allow me him to go out. He has a 6 funny looking houses in south cove sentosa and stays in one. His family- wife and 4 kids stay in another house. He goes over back and forth between the houses. For the longest time, he has told me that his wife and him have problems and many issues. I told my husband of the problems IC faced and my husband and I usually told him- to take it easy. When he asked me to come over in June to sign the account opening, he grabbed my hand. I pulled my hand away and told him not to do that. He smiled sheepishly and then continued signing the account opening forms. There were only the 2 of us at his residence. After that incident, he would always stand near me, sit next to me, touch my shoulder. I had to do work so I had to still see him for account signing and proposal of ideas. I did not think much of it. As I believe naively since he knows my family, he won’t do me any harm. In December, when I had to go over , he locked the door and asked me to go up to the study room. He forced me to perform a sexual act on Him- a blowjob. I was too embarrassed and ashamed to tell anyone this- even my husband. Worse still, a few days later, I had ulcers at my private region and when I saw my gynecologist - she confirmed I have HSV1 . This pervert is well known to have STDs - hsv1 and hsv2  or maybe even worse.His ex wife “ Wendy “second wife has shared this with almost everyone she knows and therefore he has spread this to me knowingly that he would pass it to me. I would like to have this person exposed as I do not believe I’m the only victim and there must be many other ladies he has preyed on in leading them and trapping them .When I shared this incident with his wife, she did not seem surprised and as she knows her husband only too well. This man is a sexual predator and he should be stopped and hopefully the Authorities would stop men like these spreading diseases , breaking up families .

98399,"In response to #98303:I think I can talk about this from a guy's perspective (well actually just from my perspective, since clearly I can't speak for all guys).I think there are two possible reasons. The first is that they felt intimidated by you, like some of the comments suggested. However, I think the second reason is far more likely. It is that you are not conforming to expectations, and they felt that you were mocking them. Academic circles are extremely tightly knit, especially in the STEM fields. I've had casual conversations with professors/lecturers, and the were referring to their own PhD supervisors as their (academic) ""parents"", ""grandparents"", and collaborators as their ""brothers"" and ""sisters"". Studying for a PhD is like trying to join this family. Right now, you are a complete outsider to this family, and by asking very detailed questions on their work, it feels like you are trying to barge in and be adopted. You say that you know what you are talking about, but to them, you don't. Many of them have spent years working towards their area of interest (possibly gained interest in JC/poly, worked towards it in 4 years undergrad plus did some research projects along the way). You mentioned that you talked to 3 different guys doing engineering, quantum chemistry, and computing respectively. imo it is highly unlikely that you were able to match their knowledge in all of those areas.I've had a similar experience with someone recently. This person kept asking me highly technical questions (Mayer Vietoris Sequences) but it soon became clear from her responses that she didn't have the prerequisite knowledge (what is a normal subgroup?). She didn't know what she was talking about, but only pretended to know. It felt like she were trying to learn certain ""key words and key phrases"" just to impress me or something, and I was certainly not very impressed. To me, she sounded like ""that smart alec in class"" bragging about how they already know all the course material, but upon closer inspection, only knows things on a superficial level to look good. Younger me in my JC/Undergrad days would have been hit with a severe bout of imposter syndrome, but now I know how to keep myself together. These experiences are still very mentally draining and I don't want to be dating this sort of person long term.I wanted to ghost her right there right then, but decided to entertain my inner psychopath a bit more, by playing the same card back. I slowly steered the conversation to her interests and area of study, and away from mine. Then, I scrutinized everything they said, and asked highly specific questions about tiny details and technicalities. Needless to say, her tone became increasingly agitated and she got pissed off after a while. She then ghosted me shortly after.I probably sound like a freak right now, but I hope I have made my point clear.-#98399: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98399","['Like: 14 people', 'Haha: 6 people']",0 Comments,1 share

98397,"Hi admin, please share this as I feel that this is a matter of public interest.I am disappointed and puzzled at how NUS medicine is approaching this pandemic.I am a parent of a year 3 going to year 4 medical student in NUS medicine. This coming Saturday, the cohort will be having a formative clinical examination (formative meaning the marks for the exam will not be included in the grade for the academic year). To provide a context, the clinical exam consists of medical students being in a room with a patient (in this exam, it would be a standardised patient i.e. sort of a ‘healthy’ actor) and an examiner (who is a doctor). Students are then rotate to different rooms in a round robin fashion.Granted, the school had made some preparations with regards to this exam.(1) Students will be split into smaller groups and are to report to multiple venues with no mingling. However, I am not certain if students of different reporting venues will be meeting the same patient/doctor. From my understanding, there might be a chance where students of different reporting venues will be meeting the same patient/doctor for the exam in their respective examination rooms. This mingling of students, standardised patients and doctors only creates room for a disaster to unfold. I am not sure if the doctors all belong to the same healthcare cluster. If they are not, the school is encouraging unnecessary mingling of the public with the hospitals. And if they are, they are also encouraging mingling of the public and that healthcare cluster. All this coupled with the emergence of new COVID clusters recently, will make us vulnerable to a potential new NUS/hospital COVID cluster.(2) Students are made to undergo a COVID swab, likely the antigen rapid tests (ART). This should be similar to the pre-event testing rolled out by MOH where people attending the examination are made to do a swab. According to a factsheet published by MOH on 20 Oct 2020, the ARTs minimally meet the WHO’s recommendation of at least 80% sensitivity. Meaning, they can only pick up at least 80% of individuals who are infected with COVID-19. As a non-medical pre-event testing, it should be sufficient. But for this clinical exam, where doctors from (possibly different) hospitals are involve (hospitals which houses sick patients and had a history of having a TTSH cluster), one would expect a higher sensitivity test.In addition, because of this exam, I heard from my daughter that a lot of students gather at each other houses/school (legally of course) to practice physical examination techniques. I feel that this encourages social interaction and is putting our students at risk.While I do understand why Singapore opened to Phase 3 HA as they had to prevent “many businesses to fold” as elaborated by Minister Lawrence Wong, I do not understand why the school is insisting on holding this big scale examination at this present moment when there are other opportune chances in the future when things get better (which is very possible given the rate we are vaccinating the population). Currently, even the government is “buying time to speed up vaccination programme”. If I may, it is a little irresponsible for the school to carry on with the exam. There is really not much benefit for the school to hold this examination (also note that the result of the exam will not affect the promotion of students to year 4). Offhand, other opportune time would be during recess week or at the end of the academic year during the students’ 14 weeklong elective.I hope more thought can be put when planning such big scale events.Disclaimer: all information is written to the best of my knowledge.

One thing that is weighing on mind is my impression/liking of his family (or maybe just his parents) I would say overall they are still generally bearable since I don’t see them very often at the moment. But I am starting to picture how it would be like if I were to become their DIL. I try my best to smile and accommodate to them however ridiculous their actions are. For example, while we are eating, it suddenly becomes a food judging session whereby I am questioned about how the food tastes, how does it compare to other brands, discuss about the ingredients used (whether it’s good or bad quality) and having to state the reason for every answer I give. And if they dislike the food, they’d ask me to identify what the problem is even if I personally liked it. throughout the time when I see them, they would just bombard me with weird and uncomfortable questions. Basically, they are just questioning every decision I make be it clothing choice or food choice, it can be literally anything. They’d make me justify or explain why I feel a certain way about a topic or choose to eat a certain food. And if my answer doesn’t impress or meet their expectations, they would “counter attack” and it becomes like a debate LOL it’s really tiring if I have to deal with this frequently and my partner doesn’t voice anything as he respects his parents a lot.-#98396: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98396","['Like: 10 people', 'Sad: 2 people', 'Wow: 1 person']",27 comments,5 shares

(Friends had to private their IG & hide their stories from him as well)•In the later part of our relationship, he even controlled the time I get to spend with my family. • I can never be late to meeting him, which means I can never sleep in on a weekend. I had to set an alarm for 9am whenever we were meeting, while he would still be asleep till 3pm. Still he gave me shit whenever I turn up past 12 noon. • A date would turn into staying at home, playing games and sex. • He would go through my phone in secret and confront me whenever he did not like what he read. • He would always arrive late and leave early at my family gathering, but I was not allowed that privileges at his family gathering. • Whenever he leaves my family gathering, I was expected to leave as well. • Towards the end of our relationship, whenever we were on dates - he would be on his phone all the time. Barely any interaction. Still that was my fault?!?!?• He would question my decision to relocate overseas and gave me shit for doing so. • He would ask his mom for it money when he’s broke. (He was 22 and still did that, yikes.)• Used Find My Friends to track my location when I was overseas. Basically I was to be at home or at Uni, anywhere else he would call and text me demanding to know the reason why. If I were to switch it off, threats would come in. • I would self-harm from time to time, just cause it was taking a toll on me emotionally. Initially, he felt guilt and changed his attitude towards me. But, he would used it as a ammunition and blackmail me into doing things for him otherwise he would snitch on me. You see this?• Also, he tried to propose to see if I would ditch a bright future and stay with him and be a slave to him• Then asked if I wanna BTO with him, and his parents will pay the downpayment as a gift.Decided to finally dump his ass cause he went full on crazy and blocked me on various messaging app, cause I fell asleep while browsing facebook and could not reply to his messages. I did message him back, but he blocked me and the message did not went through lel. Dumbass. P.S - I hope he’s reading NUSWhispers so he can see what a scum he was.-#98384: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98384","['Like: 171 people', 'Care: 38 people', 'Wow: 18 people']",59 comments,45 shares

98380,"Why are people such hypocrites when it comes to killing animals for food nowadays?I fish as a hobby and I eat the majority of what I fish, so I have no issues with killing animals with the intent of eating them.Few days back, I invited 3 friends to my apartment and I told them I'd be preparing chilli crab for them. They were so excited over the food and one even said it's her favourite dish. I bought 4 live sri lankan crabs home and waited for my friends to arrive before processing them because I wanted to keep the food fresh.When my friends came, they were shocked that I bought live crabs. I told them it's for freshness. The friend who said chilli crab was her favourite dish started arguing with me, calling me a murderer.I told her to look away and proceeded to kill the crabs swiftly with a knife up the bottom and she started crying. My other friends were split, with one supporting her and saying I'm a monster, while the other said I am just doing what every restaurant does.I called her a hypocrite for eating crabs at a restaurant even though she can't stand the crabs being killed, and she couldn't come out with a proper reply. Needless to say the gathering sucked and she ran home crying with one other friend. This left the 2 of us to eat 4 crabs and it was absolutely delicious.Animal cruelty starts at the dinner table and I admit I am cruel to animals for the sake of food. But at least I'm no hypocrite.-#98380: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98380","['Like: 400 people', 'Haha: 256 people']",199 comments,171 shares

In the recent months, I noticed him pleasuring himself with porn twice in the night when everyone has gone to bed. I am aware I'm not meeting his needs because I am always tired due to work and parenting. I'm not sure if he is turning to pornography because of his addiction to it or that I'm simply not meeting his needs.I can't help but feel upset.

98368,"I just came back from a staycation with my ex-girlfriend and man, it was the worst 3 days I spent with her. I thought of getting to know her more and hopefully rekindle our relationship as we are still close friends. I brought card games so that things won't be so boring and she just said it's ok (with a very uninterested tone), before ignoring me coldly and used her phone and texted all day long makes me feel even more helpless and angry.. Our interactions are quite limited throughout the 3 days and it was damn awkward so much so that I have thoughts of leaving her alone in the hotel not more than once. I wanted to avoid the silence and awkwardness by asking her some questions, but I don't know what to ask.As the bathroom do not have any curtains, and there is only 1 bathroom, so when she's inside bathing, then if I want to use the toilet while she is inside right, she would refuse. I thought of having the both of us having a hot and great shower together vanished no matter how much I plead and I am stuck outside the bathroom until she is done.We slept on 2 separate beds and I wanted to combine the 2 beds into 1 by pushing the beds together so that we can be closer. However, any physical interactions (hand-holding, hugs etc) was refused by her and I am so tired by her.I cannot find much topics to chat with her and I am quite tired with how she treat me so coldly. She is still very accommodating about stuff as she is fine with a lot of things, only physical stuff she minds a lot (no seeing of her nudes eg). I don't know what she wants in our friendship to be frank. Maybe it's just me trying to fix things up on my part, but things would never be the same again. It's like my idea of staycation that is supposed to be a sweet and excellent opportunity for us to know each other more very much different from the reality.If I know things would turn out this way then I would not have book a staycation with her, which is a waste of my money.-#98368: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98368","['Haha: 114 people', 'Like: 54 people']",163 comments,24 shares
98367,"I got riled up enough to write this post today so here it is.To all mothers of boys or men who has raised them, please just please let us off. In this day and age, we would like to have freedom of speech and choice.Please stop cornering us with ""Can we take your babies? Can we come to see them anytime?""We understand your need to helicopter your precious son. Please understand that your grandkids are OUR kids and we would love to raise them ourselves in a certain way, much like how you guys raised your kids in your own ways. Your son is not perfect and neither am I, but we will try our utmost best to pass down the good morals and habits to our kids. Remember, its our kids now, its our time now, its not yours anymore. Your son has grown up and he has his own quirks and bad habits, he has his own personality and preferences and temper. He may be terrible at cleaning up after himself, but thats because you pick up after him all the time. I am not perfect either, but when we become parents, we will find our own ways. You can give us advice, but do so at moderation, and tell us in a way we can accept, rather than ""i will help you do laundry, iron my son's work shirts, and clean your house"". No. I will not allow you because the same way I want him to learn, i want my children to have discipline and learn that the world does not fall by their feet. I want my children to learn, not to be indulgent and lazy, and to not take my traits of stubbornness too. I understand I have faults, and your son will correct then from your grandkids, not you. It is our time, yours have passed. Its time for you to take a step back.To all mothers-in-law, regardless of how good you think your son is, it is very rude to be condescending to us. We get that you gave up your youth and possibly job to take care of him, but in this current landscape and economy, its hard for one of us to quit to be a homemaker. We understand your son earns more than us, but it is not right to insult us that we can't do work or earn much just because your son works longer hours. It is not only rude, it hurts our feelings. We have a difficult time at work and we are here to see your son, we try to respect you and have you around to include you too, but its too rude for you to say all these condescending words. We understand we are not your children so our achievements mean nothing in comparison to your son, but bear in mind, if your son chose to marry us, your grandkids will have our genes too. To all mothers in law, can we remind you that your son is a fully grown adult. He knows how to take care of himself without you around. You don't have to keep reminding us how to do things the way you did, or whether you know his body best because you took care of him the whole time, because he is an adult and he will be the father to my kids. He has to set a good example and be the role model to my children, and I wouldn't want my children to wonder and develop any complexes due to your over-smothering and over-helicopter parenting style. I also do not have the time and energy to clean, cook, give birth, do everything for my children and treat your son like my 1st born manchild. He is a grown ass man, stop it, its embarrassing.All in all, all daughters in law in the world will respect you, as long as you give them basic human respect too. We are also our own parents' princesses, and we are also someone's daughter. Same as what you have experienced, we want things to be different. Afterall, it is a different era and time. Its time for you to take a step back and let go. They always say married ladies have no home, it is true because if we are wronged by our in laws, we can't go back to our own parents too. Afterall, we are married. Why can't this apply to your son? Even in birds and other animals, building a means we both leave our nest to build a new home by ourselves. Marriage means we form a nuclear family, and its me and him starting one. Please give us your blessings and cut the invisible umbilical cord. He will after all grow up to be a man, a father, a grandfather and of course, a husband. He is your son, but he is much more roles to our family. Similarly, by right I will enter your family, so if you could respect everyone else, why must you treat me differently with harsh words?I will treat you like my own mother, sharing with you what I have, my troubles, my happiness and joy, as long as you acknowledge that we are also human beings. We want our own life, freedom, and own right to build our own family. And for that, to all mothers in law in the world, we daughters in law will be grateful.-#98367: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98367","['Like: 156 people', 'Care: 37 people', 'Love: 15 people']",40 comments,33 shares

However, lately the last 1 year my relationship with him is abit strained. Currently we are in a LDR and every time we get into an argument, he’d hang up on me and I’d constantly call him until he picks up. Each time I try to express how I feel, he take it as seem I am nagging at him and chose to dismiss how I feel and proceed to hang up cause he cannot deal with me. I am not nagging but we are just a few months away into the wedding but he don’t seem to take the wedding so seriously. He procrastinate everything I asked him to do to do the point that that we lost an opportunity (will not elaborate what it is as I feel like it’s hig dignity and I don’t want to air it).To him, he’s providing the money for the wedding and I know what’s best so i have been handling everything from the planning to the bookings etc and all I ever asked him to do is to settle some administrative stuff which I cannot do on my end and he puts it off till the very end that resulted in us having to push the wedding a month back cause we could not meet the dateline. I feel really tired having to feel like this. I can’t express how I feel to him because he feels like I’m just nagging at him and I don’t know what to do. I love him a lot but I cannot keep feeling like this at the fact that he don’t respect me enough to do something I asked him to do and not procrastinate. Should I cancel the wedding? I am seriously considering to just disappear from him because no matter what I said, he chose not to acknowledge it until the point where I really want to call off the wedding and does not want to marry him, he starts shaking and apologise and promised to change. What’s your advice for someone in my situation? I’m open to anything regardless if you’re single or married etc.. please help me stop feeling like this -#98359: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98359","['Like: 20 people', 'Care: 10 people', 'Sad: 6 people']",62 comments,10 shares
98353,"I think it was a Tuesday. Right after lectures, I went to Clementi NTUC to buy a drink. That was when I saw him. Tall and slender, with black-framed glasses and a boyish haircut, there he was in an NUS Computing t-shirt. I had never seen him before. Yet, it was like a million magnets were pulling me closer to him. This was unlike anything I have ever felt before or since. I wanted to go up and say hi, but I was shy. I had to try damn hard to stop smiling; it was fucking ridiculous. I went to the cup noodles aisle to get my lunch before I went back to campus. I tried to concentrate on what I needed to get but I was so distracted by him.""Excuse me,"" a voice said from behind. Oh shit no it was him. What do I do now? I panicked internally until he said, ""Do you know how much this one costs? I want to get that but the price thing in front looks like it's spoilt."" He pointed to the green cup in my hand. I think I said something like, ""Uhm, It's 1.50."" He took 2 of those and said thanks. It felt like an important crossroads in my life where I could have made a different decision. Perhaps we would have had a connection. But I didn't and here I am today writing this post to thousands hoping that he would be one of them.

98346,"Went onto Tinder for fun without much expectations. I think I have a nice personality (typical nice guy), but I’m not exactly attractive nor good at conversations, hence my doubts on my own success over TinderAnyway, matched with a really pretty lady very quickly on my first night of using, whom I thought was quite out of my league based on appearance. She’s not from the SEA region, and not entirely chinese speaking, just to eliminate your stereotype countries. Our conversations are still ongoing albeit slow, but all these while, I kept wondering if it was some sort of elaborate scam or if there was some hidden agenda. Mainly because I kept thinking if this match was too good to be true. We spoke a lot on the digital market, and she shared her successful experience and encouraged me to get started. I was slowly picking up abit of knowledge on my own and was already planning do so in the future, so it wasn’t hard to convince me about how lucrative it was. There wasn’t any hard sell from her but throughout, I was extremely wary, like just to protect myself if it actually turned out to be some sort of financial scam. Which might actually also explain this match. We exchanged contact (she initiated), but I don’t think it was her personal number. I’m fine if it isn’t, as I totally believe it’s for her own safety. But at the same time, am unsure if it was a red flag. It was a business account too. So anyway I’m in a really confused stage. Large part of me is hoping something can develop so I’m still trying to put in effort,  but another large part of me is raising my shields really really high.(I believe in long distance, so I’m not writing it off so quickly based on location) And me being me, my thoughts brought this further to wonder if I do seriously have some trust issues, and if I’m destined to just screw up any future possible relationships.-#98346: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98346","['Haha: 17 people', 'Like: 14 people']",41 comments,6 shares

98347,"[A story about my father]I grew up in a broken family - my mother divorced with my father when my sister and I were 10 & 8years old respectively. My mother was seeing someone else then and had remarried shortly after the divorce. We were often told and taught by our paternal grandmother to tell the judge@the family court about our wish to follow our father should there be a need to go through court trial. But guess what, we don't have to go through our worse fear as a child of choosing between mother or father as our mother give up on us (at least we were told this way through our growing years). You must be wondering what has that got to do with my father, and on this special day? My father who is a person of few words has not spoken a bad word about my mother all these years. Taking care of 2 daughters as a single dad is not easy. With the absence of a wife to look after the children while you were away for work, my grandmother were rope in to care for us on a more permanent basis.Financially, we weren't doing well as my father was neither highly educated nor having a high paying job. Out of goodwill, my grandmother did not expect much from him and accept the child allowance he could afford.To make matter worse, with the increasingly amount of freedom cum loneliness, my dad made an unwise decision to mix with bad company whom introduced him to drugs. He started to default the child allowance and often asked my grandmother for money. Many times, my grandmother just give in to him (reluctantly) as those were his savings she claimed. As true as Karma is a bitch, my dad was soon arrested and imprisoned for a few years due to drug abuse offence. All these happens within a 2years period while I felt so distraught as I've yet come to terms of the parents divorce yet have to face with the idea of my absence father. As a result, our relationship got more distant. During his time of imprisonment, my grandmother will bring us to the prison to visit him. A few years has passed and he was imprisoned another time for contraband cigarettes related offence. The second time I was slightly less affected than the first time he went in.  Moving forward to recent years, he seems to have changed for the better. On thing I saw was he started contributing to the household expenses although he wasn't earning much as a free-lancer. There are times we still quarrel over finances especially during COVID-19 period when his job was affected. During then, my married sister and I provide him with some ad-hoc contribution but at some point I felt that he should at least made an attempt to look for a more stable job instead of being too dependent on us who are low income earners. The pandemic also made us realized the need to plan ahead financially. Thank goodness my father has a 3room flat which has been vacant for awhile. Every time I suggested he rents out, he seems dismissive but the economic downtown indeed serve as a wake up call for him such that he decided to rent out the unit. With his rental income and free-lance income, I can finally be less worry about him. Over the years, we also grow slightly closer than before as I saw he's trying to help out the household expenses although I still struggle with flashbacks from the bitter past. I am thankful I have other family members I can look up to, peer and religious support these years which I can seek advise from when I'm feeling lost. Often, we heard the saying that ""we can't choose our parents but we can decide on the future we want"". Today, I still stand by that saying and hope to take this chance to encourage those with similar pasts that you can live better than your yesterday. Alas, I want to wish all fathers of the pasts, current and future - Happy father's day ~ and thank you for the big and small sacrifices you've made and systemically impacting us in the community.

98335,"I love being a pharmacist. I love serving my patients dedicatedly. I enjoy seeing them get well or empowered to take care of themselves. I believe pharmacists are able to help support doctors better  and do a lot more for our patients by humbly learning in our course of work from the doctors and patients, continuously enriching ourselves by going for Masters, Pharm D, National Collaborative Prescribing Course. While those bright sparks of pharmacy have achieved a lot and share the pride and passion of pharmacy, they are the rare fews blessed with good mentors, opportunities and being in the profession at the right time while they dedicated their time to do what many others did too. The majority are not that lucky. After a decade of work and freely “volunteering” my time while being grossly underpaid yet trying to be idealistic and believe one does not need to be overly rich because that cost will translate to higher healthcare costs, should I accept it that my institution does not value a decade of work experience as compared to a fresh pharmacist? The salary of a fresh grad is so much better than someone in the system for ten with more experience experience. While the ten year pharmacist is able to serve patients better and often gets compliments from the patients for the good care they received, the institutions believe this is EXPECTED of a pharmacist day-to-day work and hence does not justify a promotion or pay rise. While doctors get pay increment for every formal education they received, it does not work so for a pharmacist. The university promotes pharmacy as a course. The national pharmacy landscape paints an ideal picture of so much things pharmacy can improve. Yet, on the ground, everyday the Pharmacy managers tell their staff the things they do are redundant because it is not money generating. The staff is spending too much time when the reality is the staff is expected to make things happen with so little resources and expected to make the impossible happen. At the end of the day, the pharmacy managers say all these efforts are day to day efforts, insufficient to promote or get a pay rise. When you see the truth and ask to spend time not doing there work considered redundant by the administrators and ask what will get you promoted or given a pay rise, no strong answer is given. Because, the truth is, as a pharmacist, all you need to do is ensure timely and safe supply of medicines. It is that basic. Counseling is additional. Time spent with patient is not money generating to the pharmacy but a cost incurred to the pharmacy. The work is truly mundane and perhaps redundant as the administrators say it. So, to the young ones out there, if you can still U-turn, choose a different profession. Things will not get better unless society acknowledges and is willing to pay for a pharmacists’ service like in other countries. In the mean time, we are just a bunch of useful but free resource to be exploited. Can any strongly passionate person not be jaded after being abused by the never improving system for so long ?

98332,"This is in response to post #98230. Warning, it is a long post ahead.Firstly, I am appalled by the comments. OP, please please do not be disheartened when you read through the many negative comments. I don’t think the situation you are in is one that many can relate to. More importantly I think many might be misunderstanding on real problem here.The issue at hand is that you feel pent up and resentment. You’re doing your best you can at securing a well-paying job despite juggling the young children and managing the household. It is an unfair situation because your husband, who is earning a similar amount, get his hands off the kids and household. Love aside, marriage is a partnership. It is not about making equal contributations because everyone have different strengths and weaknesses. It’s about both parties making similar levels of effort in maintaining and growing the family, it’s the comradeship of going through tough times together that is held by the core vision of the couple to want to work through the obstacles in life together. But, it’s not there because of your husband’s lack of interest in the family and the bigger picture. (Sorry to say this but it sounds like your husband is not very mature even in his 30s. That’s ok - mine isn’t too, but I still love him to bits till today after decades of married life together)If your partner is not involved with household and children management, one can only pray that he/she is more successful career-wise. Why? Not because the family needs more money and not doing well financially (OP has clearly stated - why are commenters still harping on this?) If you are OP and overwhelmed with handling everything, would you feel more sad if this was because (1) partner working hard to support family, long working hours and cannot help out, or too stressed and tired so need to unwind with videos, OR (2) partner is plainly refusing to help out because he prioritizes his me-time over the family, and the wife’s physical and emotional well-being. The first situation would render much more fairness to OP’s situation, right?To commenters who ask OP to delegate child-related duties to the husband: you probably won’t understand how it’s like until you are in the situation. Yes you can tell your husband to do specific chores, and he probably will do them. But you might only be able to delegate him a few things that he can do properly. More importantly, every time you need to ask him to help, it is  saddening. Because he is more pre-occupied with his own interests (in other words, does not prioritize his family), he cannot see for himself what needs to be done and what the wife needs help in. And OP, from your post, I can tell that you are a capable lady. You probably have been able to manage things on your own since the beginning; which could be why your husband didn’t get into right mindset and became how he is like today. You can try to remind him that every little thing in the house that he chooses to ignore, has to be done by you (unless you have helper lah). Tell him that you’re not coping and you NEED his help. If he still has some love for you more than his videos (and has any bit of ego), trust me, this will help him to take more initiative. But this increased involvement would be out of love for you - I would think that since he is inherently not very family oriented or inclined, this part is hard to change lah.Oh yes, please do not expect your husband to be able to become more ambitious or family-oriented. As much as how that would solve everything, it is just not possible. My husband was just like yours, OP. I hated him during the dark days because I felt unfair at our uneven contributions to the family and at the same time, battered by the holy trinity of full-time work, household chores and managing kids. I tried to imagine if a divorce would be the solution. It was a plausible option because after a divorce, the actual work I had to do was the same, but one less “child” to take care of and most importantly, I will be free of the emotional burden of having to deal with the pent-up resentment. But I did not go ahead with a divorce, because I could foresee a ridiculous situation in which as a divorcee, I would still date my ex-husband. Our love was still there. Or rather, I didn’t resent him strongly enough to overpower the love. But this was in my personal situation, may not be applicable to others’ situations. You might want to ask yourself whether you love him enough to still hold on, and whether he loves you enough to continue turning a blind eye to your needs.OP, hang in there because things will get better. Your time will be yours again when your children are older and less physically needy. By then, child-related duties are easier so your husband might be able to help you out better. You will find back the time and energy to do things you once love once your kids go to school. Chances are, your resentment for your husband will fade with time on its own without any action on anyone’s end. When you get older, you might just want to relax with your partner and enjoy life instead. Question is whether deep down, you still want to have this future with him? And is this enough to help you pull through the dark times that you are facing right now?Auntie wishes you the best, OP. You are doing well, and you are allowed to feel however you want to feel.

98330,"Hello guys, just wanna seek some advices from yall I’ve been dating this man for 2-3 years. To be honest, he’s not my ideal type. Neither he has the looks, body and he drinks and smokes as well. During the first few months, he’s very attentive towards me, nice and caring, like what typical couples would go through during the honeymoon stage.After we got together, he became cold, I guess the sweetness wore out. We rarely went out to have a proper date, only dinner and his place typically. I guess we are quite chill about it?Though I mentioned to head out once in awhile, he would ask me to plan everything, which i got the impression that he’s not interested. But ok la, he still help me whenever I needed. All these are fine, just probably I’m quite particular about him not greeting my parents.Only after 2 years, he went up to my place. During the past CNY, he didn’t bother to come over. I’ve tried inviting him over for dinner during non-festive periods, he would just MIA and reply afterwards. I didn’t want to force him to come over, but just wanna to know if this behaviour is normal?Brought this concern of mine to him, and what he told me was, after marriage, with kids and all, we probably don’t see our parents all the time. Ehh idk la, we go over to his place every weekend, but once in a while just chill at my place cannot meh. Ok la, part of me wanted my parents to understand him and help me see see if he’s the right guy too hahaaBut ya, just wanted to know how do I get him to blend in with my family. It seemed like he’s disrespecting my family.

98329,"Hi everyone. I need help! My elderly father (but mobile) recently moved in with me because of covid. He otherwise stays in JB. I am married and he shares the room with my only son who is 9yo. My dad and I do not have a warm relationship but it’s not unpleasant. I have no issues with him staying with me. The problem is, he stinks. ???? he seldom showers and he stays cooped up in the room most times. It’s so bad that even the living room now stinks. It’s the kind of mouldy old man smell. I love my father a lot and I don’t want to hurt him by telling him something personal like to shower everyday. Small things like this can upset him. Can anyone suggest how I can help to freshen up the room? I’ve put room air freshener, doesn’t work.

98327,"Hi, there is this girl who was an intern at my office and then continued to be a full-timer because she was really good at the work. She is actually very pretty, outgoing and extremely caring. There were already 2-3 guys who were chasing her. I mean they switched places just to sit closer to her and they would stay back to help her with her issues.When she was an intern, I did not really pay much attention because most of the time, they would leave within a few months. I just socialised with her just like I would with any other colleague.As I see her more often nowadays, I have started to feel more attracted towards her. I have never dated before because I was too shy/introverted and too focused on studies. I also don't really look good although I am fit. I am lean muscular so you cannot see the definitions without me removing the shirt which absolutely sucks. I do not really know how to approach without being inappropriate. I mean she was an intern here which means I am senior. There is also the problem of the other guys who are constantly chasing her. Recently, there was no one at the office so I asked her if she wanted to go out for lunch with me. However, she turned me down. I felt really bad. I have gone alone with other female colleagues for lunch and I had no issues so far. If she was even remotely interested in me, she would have come with me right? There was also this incident where she forgot to pass me some documents even though she knew I needed them urgently. It kind of shows that she is not interested in me again. I don't know what to do here. Is appropriate to fall for you colleague who was an intern? If I ask her out, would it spoil the relationship? I already failed a simple lunch meeting, how in the world is she going to like me? By the way, how to ask? I don't even know how to ask. Would I creep her out? How do I be attractive to her? How do I impress her? I cannot even get close to her to know her because she is always surrounded by people. Does she even think about me?AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I am going crazy here! I am thinking about her everyday and I even have dreams about her. My heart literally pounded the other day when she walked past me which never happened before. I thought I was really having a heart attack. I feel like I am falling for her more and more everyday. Someone please help here!!!!

Apparently the job was posted by the recruitment agency Talent Hub SG, although I am unable find its website. Anyway, a guy from the agency called me for an interview. During the interview, he told me that there is no more opening for the personal assistant job, but he has two other jobs available, marketing assistant and sales associate. Then he asked if I am interested in either of these 2 jobs. I was quite sian by this time so I told him I prefer the marketing assistant role. And then we proceeded with the interview. I find the process weird because he asked me questions like 'tell me a fun fact about yourself', 'what do you do during your free time'. It feels more like date questions. Also, I was not prepared for this job. I do not even know what is my responsibilities that are required for this job. In fact, I did not even submit my resume. I feel so weird throughout.

98320,"A true story. I encourage those guys finding their better half not to give up.I met a very nice pretty lady during the time I was doing paid delivery part time. I held a professional full time job as well. Even before meeting her, on the app I told her that I was a criminal who went to prison for 10 years rape. I asked her if she was comfortable if I were to be delivering to her appartment. I did this because I had given up on finding the right woman. So I might as well project a negative image of myself for fun right?Things took a turn. She was the only one who thanked me for my honesty. The others requested that I should not even be dealing where female customers are or that they do not want me there. I also received a number of nasty comments from some women. For the first time I had full experience of what ex convicts experience.Eventually the lady who thanked me and I started dating. I had to live my lie. When we started living together, I would go out of home to work as a storeman only to collect my office clothes at a self-storeage facility, shower in the gym toilet and change into office attire. The whole process was tedious. After work it was drycleaning of my clothes at self service laundry and to the self storeage and then back home. For her my long hours at work were okay as she thought my job was demanding. In fact 4 of the 12 hours I was supposed to be working were spent in the cover up process.We dated on weekends and she did not even ask how I was able to afford some items with my salary. She did not even ask why I did not have to work weekends and public holidays.We rented a room to stay with her paying all of the rent since she thought I did not earn much. Her parents objected to us being together. They told her ""Once a criminal forever a criminal"".Some years passed after we got married. I had enough to by a 5 room HDB flat. I wanted to buy one but I knew it would raise questions as to how I can afford to pay for it fully. I wanted to buy a car but it would also raise questions. So I had no choice. I had to admit to her the truth. She cried for two reasons. Firstly because I cheated her for so long. Secondly she was happy I was a clean man who could give her a decent life.-#98320: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98320","['Like: 79 people', 'Haha: 53 people']",45 comments,14 shares

98314,"Hi everyone, I just wanna ask for advice in asking out a friend.Here's some context. I, (28m), met this girl (24) when we were both in the same class in poly. We only became friends when we were going home together one day and realised we have similar interests. Initially, I was pretty awkward when it comes to having conversations with her. I don't have much female friends in the first place. Eventually, this friendship developed to the point where I was pretty talkative around her and we often hang out with mutual friends. This friendship remained strong even after graduation and we went to seperate universities. We also went on an overseas trip together. It was during this trip that I started to see her as more than a friend, but I wasn't sure if what I was feeling was fleeting . During the pandemic, she had some trouble with her studies and was diagnosed with depression. When she told me this, I tried my best to be supportive of her and her mental well-being. I really care for her and I still want to be with her.Here's the problem I'm facing. I'm a very introverted person, especially with women. I have no experience whatsoever with relationships. I have a low self-esteem and I don't see myself being someone who is good enough for her. Also, I don't think I was able to comfort her properly during her depressed moments. wouldn't mind being rejected if I asked her out, but I really don't want our friendship to be affected due to this.

To fulfill my needs, I often look for hook-ups in dating apps but I always make sure that there is consent and I regularly check for STDs. When I brag to my friends about my sex history, some of them seems disgusted and start distancing themselves. It feels really sad to see that people are so superficial. Maybe they are just jealous. People often say that people who fool around cannot settle down but I feel that it's not true.

Idw to be the reason that his relationship with his parents is damaged.

Whenever his family comments about my disability, he has this awards facial expression. I don't know how to describe. He doesn't really stand by me in such situations. If he is willing to stand by me in such situations I will not hesitate. But he doesn't and I'm afriad I will end up suffering alone. I tried talking to him. I made it clear to him that I am not upset with his family. I am upset with his response. All he does is shrug his shoulder and say ""Maybe. I don't know"".

98306,"To #98264 Mental well being is very important. I have worked for a few years now and have notice the rise of such issuesIf this is your first job, I would suggest to start looking out first before resigning. Take a look at the job market and see if is moving well. If is slow, I suggest you hold on first. You are only a few months into your new job, so probably taking 2 weeks of leave is out of question, otherwise I would have suggest so, than to resign.Is easier to manage your own expectations than to manage others. If this is not your first job, I may have to be alittle direct here. Try to reevaluate your suitability for the role, or this career that you choose to be in. If the reason for leaving past jobs has been due to culture misfit, then perhaps gotta relook at your own strengths and see where they can play best at. Every company has its own set of problem and culture, you have to be adaptable to it. However let no one de-value you in any possible ways you can offer.  Talk to your partner about your BTO. That for sure can’t change. But financing it can. Talk to the professional to see how you can work around the finances over owning a house. It can be tough on one side, but is going to be temporary. Wealth can recuperate, but health is harder, especially if is something that is inside.-#98306: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98306",['Like: 18 people'],0 Comments,1 comment
98305,"2 years ago, i found out my husband visited clubs with those skimpy dressed girls. He assured me that the girls just sit by the men to pour drinks, no nonsense. Of cos, i wasn’t naive and i am sure they are free to touch those girls. I forgave him anyway, as he said it was just for fun and knew his limits. I wasn’t going to call off my marriage because i have a young daughter, and the matter seem too trivial to make my daughter a single- parent family child. I told him i’m liberal enough to understand sometimes when men go out together they need to go to such places to boost their ego, but warned him to keep his limits. He promised no such places again. 2 years now, he’s been good, responsible and very hardworking, we live a comfortable life. Recently, i chanced upon an old chat while searching his phone for some info (he knew i was using his watsapp to search). The chat read: A- i have headache. Husband-then u shd join us for massage later. This is the same day 2 yrs ago when he went out to the skimpy-dressed girls club. And i knw this is a dirty massage place he is referring to, as 2 yrs ago i confronted him, he told me the guys proceeded to this massage palour but he did not go. So now, obviously, this old chat meant that HE WENT? Cos he is asking his friend to join them at massage? What shd i do now?? I have forgiven him then, shd i question him abt this now?

98301,"Dear post #98264 (on whether to quit new job), one year ago I wrote an anonymous post because I was facing the same dilemma as u (u may go read my post #89154). I was constantly stressed and worried, anxious and upset. I was also overworked and disenfranchised, asking myself why am I working so hard and what is my purpose in life. In summary, I felt that I was suffering from burnout, PTSD on a demanding job and it was affecting my self esteem, my productivity and ultimately the workplace suffers from my lackluster outlook.After reading the kind comments by the netizens, I start to reflect and ask myself what is the most important thing in my life. Sure I was drawing an above average pay, working in a stable large organization, but I wake up everyday like a zombie, start work at 8am, rush through all these deadlines sometimes without lunch and dinner, knock off at 3am, and the cycle repeats. One comment on my post that jumped out at me was whether the life I was living was sustainable, and there is no point in earning to pay my medical bills. When my workplace decided not to give us promotions and raises despite having the best performing year (my industry is countercyclical and does well when the wider economy is in recession), I told myself, that's it - I'm not there for the passion, my health was getting poor, work so hard and yet remuneration does not commiserate with the hours put in. So I left my job, I did things which I enjoyed, wake up everyday naturally, take long walks, attended courses which I always wanted to. It felt Abit odd when everyone else was hustling so hard in the prime of their age while I had zero income/only cash outflow but sometimes life works in miraculous ways - one day one of my ex-colleague contacted me to help him out on a part time basis, so I only had to devote few hours a day for work. Afterwards, because we had such great chemistry working together, I joined him on a full time basis. Looking back, I feel that sometimes we try too hard when life has its ways of opening another window for u when one door closes. Everyone is trying to find our own little way to survive, but don't let pressures of life get you down. Sometimes u know it in ur gut that something is not right, but we are so afraid of being the odd one out and doing things out of the norm. It's perfectly ok to stop and take a deep breath, rest, and start walking on a different path when u are ready - and don't let anyone or anything dictate the timing for when that happens. I believe at some point in our lives, we'll suffer from quarter-life/mid-life crisis. The good thing is we can all reach out to someone to talk about our issues, and I hope my own story can give u courage to take the course of action only u can decide. All the best!-#98301: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98301",['Like: 127 people'],8 comments,18 shares

98275,"To the OP of #98230Hopefully my story can allow you to reflect and understand the situation better.I have two children from a prior marriage. My ex-husband was a man child while we stayed with his parents. I’m the one who cares about striving to earn higher income and taking care of children needs while he quitted his job and became in and out of job over the years. He was not interested in trying to earn more money, more importantly not interested in self-improvement of any kind and taking care of the children unless being peristently asked to. When we divorced, one child followed my ex-husband while the other child followed me. A few years later, I met someone attractive (in a personality way): he likes to exercise, is family oriented and has a stable job. He accepted me, my child and my past, and we got married. After marriage, he changed gradually even as we have our third child: not interested in exercising and maintaining his weight (especially shortly after our wedding ceremony), less interested in interacting with our children and have little interest to ask for higher pay in his job or switch jobs to achieve higher pay. These changes are minimal (except his disinterest to maintain his weight haha), as he still takes care of our children but this is a fraction of the time he spends on the screen. Regarding finance, we had a joint account (I still have a separate personal account but he doesn’t) and he said I can invest the money in joint account if I want to, otherwise we will leave in bank account. Besides occasional squabbles, I have not regretted being with him. Now back to my ex-husband. Since divorce, he has not quitted his job and he becomes interested in personal finance and how to grow his money. He cares a lot now more on taking care of our tween child compared to the past which he left to his parents or me to take care. I’m happy to see that he has matured and my child is in better hands.Reading your story, I wonder if the state of being married can make men (and maybe also women) desire to stagnate instead of achieving in his career, life goals (to keep fit and attractive, for example). I feel that if one partner is taking responsibility for duties and roles in the family (e.g. earning income, tending to children), the other partner may not feel the need to put in some weight to achieve better outcomes.To OP, whether you divorce your husband is your personal decision. Yes some members of society will frown upon your decision, but you yourself should know best what is the best environment for your children. If you intend to go through a divorce route, make sure you have some caregiving support, for example family members or a reliable helper to help take care of your two children, and that the divorce is amicable. All the best!-#98275: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98275",['Like: 23 people'],1 comment,2 shares

98271,"Need some career advice. I graduated from NUS about a year ago. I was luckily enough to have secured a job despite the pandemic. However, the people in the company was extremely toxic and I quit my job within 6 months (it was a rotation program and i quit during the 1st rotation) as i was having alot of mental health problems (panic attack, anxiety ,probably depression due to the job) I then joined this multinational company which was actively hiring and got in. However, i now understand why they are always hiring: turnover is extremely high as the workload is very heavy. My supervisor is also an extremeeee micromanager (A very polite way to put it). During my regular check-ins with her, i mentioned how the workload might be heavy sometimes. And so she asked me to create a journal of some sort to take down how long i take to do each activity every day. In my next check-in with her, she asked me to list down and quantify how long i took to do each activity in the past week. Above all, she commented about how my hair was messy etc ( but mind you i am in an ops position with no needs of meeting any external customers) Just wanted to clarify, everyone i have spoke to in my team think that the workload is too heavy and we have high turnover rates (On average 1 year - 2 years.once, the fastest to leave would be in less than 4 weeks). Everyone wants to leave. When the team makes a small mistake in their work, we would have to start digging out pass records and my manager would press you hard to find out why did you make that particular error. Higher-ups are like that too and like to ask ‘if you screwed up’. This digging of past records served completely no purpose at all and it isnt any life and death situation. Digging up the past records was just to prove the point to then on how you “screwed up”. Not to mention, during covid Phase 2HA we still had to report back to office despite our work being fully capable of being done at home. I completely see no future with the team and cant wait to leave every single day. But with my current job record: 1st job being about 6 months and i am in my current job in only about 6 months too, would anyone hire me? Internal transfer within my current company might be difficult as we would have to declare to our managers once we get the interview (i dont understand too).

I took offence and walked out since I knew there was no point educating a bigot. I wish there was more awareness on nus nursing. We have stellar students enrolled here and the job scope of a nurse spreads well beyond cleaning people's faeces. The career offers clinical, management, research and informatics track. The starting pay of degree holders in nursing is 3.5k-4k not including bonus. We didn't study hard, got good grades just to choose a course that only ""cleans old peoples shit"".

My friend shared that the top management who sets the policy are those OSA staff sitting in the office. They never stepped in PGPR to do ground work and understand the struggles residents face, and spend most of their time Working From Home comfortably. cl/ra are treated quite badly and most of their emails sent by them are passive-aggressive, threatening that you will lose your position should you not attend their long-list of trainings. They are very compliance and rules based, and issues demerit points like free. They feel that since they sponsor RA with rooms, the RAs ought to devote fully on their RA responsibilities. Generally, the student leaders do not feel appreciated and they are generally very unhappy. Unlike other programmes like Hall and Residential Colleges, the professors live with you and treat the students with respect - they understand your problems, they sympathise with you and they work along you. You can ask around any of your PGPR friends, none of them would have spoken to their RAs or Management staffs. I'm glad that I decided not to apply for this position after talking to my friend, and decide to share this future potential candidates. Please don't come to this toxic place. Salvage yourself.

Due to the pandemic, nobody is rushing them.On the other hand , the school is pro-active and spending all its marketing resources to get the graduating cohort to give back through multiple donations.  Why can't the school spend equal effort to seek the opinion of the graduating cohort on a physical ceremony just as much as its effort to fundraise from the graduating cohort? Also, It is also disappointing to see the previous petition for a postponed physical ceremony being swept under carpet.

98252,"Hi Prof Ben / friends, what would you do if you were in my situation?My mom works as an office assistant and she's not drawing much in gross monthly income. I started work about 2 years ago, and was lucky enough to find a job that paid me a decent starting pay (take home amount about S$4,500). I decided to give my mother a monthly allowance of about S$700 as I wanted her to live more comfortably. I felt that the amount was fair because I was staying with my parents and I ought to pay my fair share of household expenses.Over the last two years, I have also gifted my mother various things which she had wanted, each of which costs between S$400 to S$800 (such as a phone, a new vacuum, massage chair and exercise device).I performed quite well at work and my current take home amount is about S$6,000. I have not increased my mother's allowance (and have no intention of increasing the allowance) as I do not think my mother needs the extra cash. This has caused some tension between us.Earlier this year, I moved out of my house (and into a shared apartment) for my mental wellbeing due to regular quarrels at home (my stepfather is a narcissist and everyone in the family quarrelled with him frequently). I continued to give my mother the same monthly allowance (S$680) as I felt I could afford it financially and I did not want to disrupt her way of life too much. That said, my mother thought that I was being wasteful as the rental fees could have been given to her as additional allowance. I don't think she really needs the money for daily expenses - she recently spent about S$3,000 on some cosmetics products. My parents also have a good amount of savings (about S$600-700k in investments and no debt); together with my monthly allowance and her salary, the amount should be sufficient for my mother to live well enough. I recently shared my hopes and dreams for the next 2 years with my mother, which on hindsight was a mistake. I wanted to move to my own apartment once I get my big raise next year. This is important to me and is something which I have been looking forward to. She asked how much the rental would cost and I said about S$2,000. She responded that she would like to retire soon, and essentially insinuated that I was being wasteful with my money (e.g. I could have supported my family instead of spending the money in wasteful things like rental which I don't really need). She stopped talking to me after that and said, ""why have I raised a child like that?"" This was hurtful because someone I loved did not share the same excitement for my future.Additional background: My mother paid >S$100,000 for some overseas programme which I wanted to attend when I was younger, but she said several times over the years that I didn't have to repay her at all and I should pursue my dreams. On the one hand, I feel a little guilty because she spent so much money on me but I am unwilling to share part of my success with her. On the other hand, I feel like I am treated like a golden ticket to a good life.

98238,"Have a feedback that I'll like to share with the NUS undergraduate admissions office. During my time in NUS, I was shocked to learn that majority of my polytechnic classmates came from Temasek poly, even more so than those who came from Singapore poly and Ngee Ann poly combined. With the no. of students coming from Temasek Polytechnic being so out of proportion, I suppose NUS admits students based on face value of the applicant's poly GPA instead of their relative GPA. Unlike other polytechnics, there is no bell curve in Temasek poly. Thus, there is no limit to the number of students in Temasek poly who can be awarded A's and any average student can easily get 3.7-3.8 out of 4. In other polys such as Singapore poly where there is actually a bell curve, a 3.7 gpa would already be considered the top, in the 90th percentile at least. Perhaps NUS isn't familiar with how poly grading systems work but moving forward, I sincerely hope that the Admissions office could do a proper review i.e. only admit the top 15% of overall applicants from each polytechnic and obtain the statistics/median gpa of graduands from each polytechnic. If we continue to go by absolute gpa, it would be extremely unfair to students from other polytechnics.-#98238: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98238","['Like: 12 people', 'Wow: 5 people', 'Haha: 3 people']",7 comments,3 shares

98230,"My husband and I are in mid 30s. He’s a nus graduate but earning 4+k even though he’s promoted twice. He’s in his second job since graduation. He has no wish to apply for jobs even though he keeps saying he’s not earning high. We have two very young children and definitely need money and i do help him to apply jobs, update his resume but he’s really not wanting to change job. Before you say anything, I’m always trying to look out for opportunities (other than when I was pregnant) and thankfully I recently secure a job that can pay me higher. I am not ambitious because I’m still a lower level employee despite being a NUS graduate as well. Still individual contributor and earning $4+k as well even though I graduated >10 years already. Disappointing right? But I’m still on the lookout for even a better salary than my current one if I can, a job scope that I may like better than my current one. And yes… if I had opened my eyes bigger before marriage, I definitely will not marry him (because of some other issue). But now we have two kids and yes, I do bring up divorce every now and then which is very depressing because I know in relationships and marriage, breakups and divorces should not always be brought up. I’m embarrassed yet I cannot stop myself from thinking about divorcing. My income is not high but I can definitely support my two kids alone and I don’t need another child (my husband). I’m really annoyed he’s not standing up as a man to take care of our family - be it physically, emotionally or financially. I don’t need him to pay for my shopping and I definitely do not go for any luxury goods. He’s just hanging there waiting to pass time. Many times I told him why did he even get into a relationship when he doesn’t even want to take on responsibility of being a husband and a father. I’m his first gf but he’s not my first bf. He doesn’t invest, doesn’t look for the best interest rates for savings accounts to try to ‘earn more’. He doesn’t try to improve himself. He only likes to watch people playing game on YouTube and watch soccer highlights. He sleeps very little every night doing all these boliao things which really annoy me because it affects his health.To me, he should take care of his health and prioritise on things especially when he has me and two children. But he doesn’t care?!?!?! To think he’s the eldest of 4 in his family but still really useless in all aspects of taking care of people. I know I will get slammed here but I really wanna hear viewpoints from others. He has changed since we got married and moved into our house. Sad to say I didn’t notice the original him (the current him) because I would then know we are not right for each other. I’m not a money leecher and I definitely only want to have a better life with my family. No need extravagant. His expenses are really high because he bought insurance policies from his younger sister before he met me and he has to pay >1k/month. His sister is really irresponsible because she only did it during her uni days to earn from family members then she quit. Please help me. Wake up my idea?

My internship supervisor seems to hate me now just because I can't get one assignment right, and I don't think my actions warrant such treatment.From my point of view, I don't think I am a poor performing intern. I contribute rather substantially to the code base under the task assigned. It is just that a particular tech stack is confusing, and suffers from conflicting information on the web, so I had a hard time understanding how the company worked with it without proper guidance.  For someone like who is completely unaware of the entire tech-stack, my supervisor's instructions were 'hint-ish' at best and cryptic at worst. Despite my best efforts to resolve the issue and actually get the code working, it somehow always result in her saying ""This is not the way we do things"", ""Why didn't you do this as instructed"", despite the fact that attempts to follow her lacklustre instructions never got the code to work at all. When I tried to clarify time and again, it seems at one point she was so fed up that she booted me off the assignment. I was polite all the way through, so it seems she was genuinely bothered at the fact that a fresh intern is automatically initiated with the specifications of the company management, which was never briefed to me in my tenure thus far.Next week, I will be reshuffled to another department in the company.

98221,"I have a question about blind rage. I don't know whether that's the correct term for it but maybe those with pschology background or have good relationship related wisdom can correct me.I get that in relationships people get upset and fight for things. Usually these fights are to make a certain aspect of the relationship better and they can get quite passionate and heated. Not ideal but hey, at least it is all for a good cause.The reason I ask about blind rage is I think my girlfriend switches into a different mode when angry. She will change topic multiple times, not respond to anything I say, and just blindly say things, scream, insult me and say all sorts of untrue things. It is like her goal is to inflict maximum damage, pain and hurt to me. Mind you this is not just for 5 minutes, it can last 2 weeks sort. Funny thing is probably 30 minutes in, she already forgot what she was fighting about, she just wants to fight for the sake of fighting. It is like some sort of vengeance thing, definitely not constructive, and definitely not for any cause or change she is passionate about. That's what I call blind rage.Almost everything the catalyst for this blind rage or should I say almost all our fights, is her being angry that I am upset or hurt by something she said or did. My girlfriend constantly tells me things like she is a very kind person, she is a person of good character. I find that very weird, like who says this kind of things, it is like she wants to label herself that way desperately. So I think if I tell her she did or said something unkind to me, that sort of threatens her self identity if that makes sense? This then becomes a sort of reflexive defense mechanism for her? I am no psychologist but 3 years of observing this has more or less convinced me this is what is happening.Sad part is I still don't know how to deal with her blind rage. Maybe if anyone knows the correct terminology for it, the internet can give me some ideas if it is a well studied mental condition. Of course any advice to make the situation better is also always welcome.-#98221: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98221","['Like: 4 people', 'Sad: 3 people', 'Care: 2 people']",10 comments,3 shares

98212,"In response to the 21 year old guy and his troubled fiancé in post #98186,I’ve had for some time, the desire to reflect and write about my past three years of experience in this love-hate relationship with architecture in NUS, so perhaps you can see this an opportunity to make a more informed decision with regards to the pursuing of this course. As you may have already read in the comments, there is the good, and of course the bad, that is associated to this discipline of study - which I will review to the best of my knowledge as a student currently undertaking the course at present.Let me just say that Architecture students are rather known to be the bunch of “no life students with no time” on the campus. Unless you have godly time management skills or incredible stamina to pull through the semester with little sleep, the typical Architecture student will not have much time to commit to sports or club activities. In certain electives with group work involved, there are actually students who shun grouping with architecture students not because they are “slackers who do not contribute”, but rather because they have “no time to contribute quality work”. Many people have little to no idea as to what we actually do in school, and depending on your circle of friends, you might actually be mocked at rather often. “Drawing only what”, “Make models ah, build tower I also can”, “Designing your next jenga ah” - I myself, frankly, was quite insulted by these little comments, made by close friends even, in the beginning. Over time you’ll learn how to laugh it off, but you’ll somehow still feel a little dissed for sure. I think the first thing I want to make clear is, yes, to be honest these chiding comments are not entirely wrong. But it’s also just the tip of the iceberg as to what we commit to, fret and stress about for the entirety of 13 weeks, for the 8 MC (which just means it counts as 2 normal modules) Design Studio Module.Our main core module, the 8 MC Design Studio, is the most important priority of any NUS Architecture student regardless of the semester. On paper, it only takes up one day of the timetable: from 9 -6pm, it’s the one day where you get to meet your tutor (which are mostly outsourced to practitioners) for feedbacks regarding your design. Conceptually however, it actually demands the entire week’s time for preparation and presentation. Because that one day is mainly for studio consultations, you don’t actually learn much unless you ask your tutors the right questions. And to know what to ask, that’s where you have to find time in the week to hit the books, research, and you might be surprised that it takes up quite a substantial amount of time before even the ideation phase, followed up by the production phase which is most well known by others as the “drawing” and “making models”. The importance of this core module is real, because it can only be taken once a year - if you fail it, you’ll have to wait an entire year to re-take it. And the importance of pulling through it will be drilled indirectly into you by the tutors starting from the first year. “Don’t spend so much time on your electives, they are not important”. “Your production this week is quite lagging behind others. Are you spending too much time on your CCA?”. “In Archi, the only important thing is studio”. It is not surprising that as a result, most architecture students (in my opinions) are always in search for that “easy-to-get-A elective” module, and those involving essay writings are especially loathed. Ironically, I feel this is one of the reasons why many a times, we feel so stressed when we have an idea block and end up “producing nonsense” sometimes. Innovation and creativity demanded by the curriculum, ironically, is many a times unearthed in the exploration of fields not even related to architecture at all.About the highly competitive environment…I think it’s something that varies according to what kind of batch mates you have, but it’s true. Frankly, I have even lost people whom I thought were close friends over grades. There were people who stopped talking to me after the grade for a certain group project turned out terrible, but I think this’s a niche extreme example. But when we talk about competitive, it’s a really toxic culture that not only exists between students, but even between tutors as well. Sometimes I feel that the friends you have in Archi are nice people to laugh and joke with during the holidays, but when the semester starts, they immediately become your fiercest rivals. Depending on the rigorous nature of the tutor’s studio, each week become a continuous cycle of outdoing one another in terms of graphical aesthetics, quantity of models or drawings produced…sometimes it’s really tiring and it makes me wonder what true learning really is, you know. If you are someone especially who suck at softwares and graphical production, you’re in for hell! And there’ll be tutors that will compare their studios’ work. “My studio’s site model is made of acrylic, your one…cardboard?” Even stuff like that you know. It’s a brewing toxic culture which makes one believe that the more you do, the better the architect you are becoming to be, and in turn the better your grades when it comes to the end of it all. And that brings me to my next point, the mental health of architecture students in NUS.Architecture school, regardless of whatever country you’re in, is known to be not only mentally but also physically tiring as well. Unlike other disciplines of study, it’s not like we have textbooks to refer to, you know. And because there’s no “fixed syllabus”, tutors don’t really teach - they only “teach” through answering what you are interested to find out about each week, so the mental rigor lies in the 100% self initiated and driven research which you have to do (ie hardcore google). This also applies to first year students - so for those who are coming in, you better know clearly what plans and sections are because the tutors here will not babysit you. As for the physical, assembling the model is just one half of it. The other half, is actually producing your work in time so that you can print out your drawings, or laser cut your model parts etc. Up the years, the things you have to print increases in size to A0 - A1s, and there are not really a lot of printing shops that specialises in this which are wallet friendly. And laser cutting takes time too depending on the quantity and quality, so you really have to juggle your time well and work backwards to factor in all this to make it in time for the studio consult day. If you have a unreasonable tutor who’s the kind that believe that “studio is the only module you are taking in NUS”, you’re in for pure hell. I’ve had one such tutor in my second year, and in my studio of 12 students, 4 ended up with depression by the seventh week, including myself. 2 went for UHC counselling, and 1 of them almost committed suicide. I think that was really a wake up call for myself at least, and it was bad to the point that I actually had to tell my tutor about it before he “suddenly became all nice and friendly” towards the end. Extremely disgusting. Substantial number of students drop out each semester too, I think about 6 took leaves of absence to take care of their mental health just this semester. But that aside, I think the mental health of NUS architecture students are swirling at rock bottom. In your first two years, you’ll be that fool that will be like, “How many all-nighters you pulled for this?”, “I stayed up again to do this drawing”. Come the third year, suddenly the fatigue of sleep deprivation just starts to sink in and there come a point of time you realize how sluggish you’ve become. The work only increases in difficulty and demands up the years, so let me just be frank and say there will be no escape from the occasional sleeping late and all nighters, though lesser if you have good time management. In response to the depression situation in year 2, an established tutor actually came to speak with our studio and spent half the time bragging about how her achievements were attributed to good time management and how she have never pulled an all nighter. Seriously, bitch please, which era did you study in? Back in your days, softwares wasn’t that developed, and so was design. Times have changed at the present, and anyone with your mindset is headed for sure doom and a repeat semester. Even the poly students, which are known to be the “Gods” for their skillsets, are visibly struggling. Sometimes, I wish the department would stop spewing such bullshit and be more real and less delusional about the mental health of their students. It’s so easy to say stuff like “get more sleep” and brush it off, but you know that isn't the case. In this aspect, I wish the department would really be more serious about it if they truly care. We're not just workhorses for the ever-going supplementing of jaw-dropping graphics for your instagram feed you know. We're humans too. So, treat us like one instead of iterating things like how ""it's not gonna be any better in the working world"".At this stage, I would like to say that architecture is not 100% just about bad stuff like the toxic slit throat culture, poor physical and mental health, and the non existent social work life balance. Because if it really was, no one with a rational train of thought would be taking it. As much as I hate these aspects of architecture in NUS, there are things which still fascinates me and sustain my passion, though reduced to embers over the years. I hate to say that your experience in NUS architecture will really be dependent on which tutor you get, but that is the truth that many of my friends can surely agree with. A terrible tutor will stress the hell out of you unreasonably or be too dumb to help you, but a good tutor will really inspire you and show you the world. Regardless, I felt that Architecture have really made me open my eyes and see the world, quite literally, in a new lens. Through your research, there will be times you have to dig into history, and that’s really one of the most amazing things you can empower yourself with in a world that’s ever-changing. It will make you want to travel to new places, and also the old places you’ve been to once again, to see the things with the new gained thoughts and perspectives gained in academia. And I think one of the best things about architecture, is that you’ll come to know a little bit of every field of study - like psychology, medicine, law, engineering, or even seemingly unrelated stuff like astrology or life science even - because these are the things that give you the ideas to be creative and break new grounds. The weekly consults will also imbue in you presentation and pitching skills, as well as the pre-mentioned time management skills to ensure all goes smoothly. Most importantly, I think Design Thinking in itself is one of the greatest takeaways you can ever receive. You’ll build up the courage to explore and repeat in pursue of success, and be hardened and open to even the harshest criticisms. These are soft skills which will accompany you far in life, even if you choose to leave the profession in the end. At the end of it all, I cannot guarantee that you will be that one shining starchitect ( a term used for world famous architects), but I can assure you that you will become courageous and easily adaptable to whatever the world out there throws out to you. Nonetheless, this is the pot of gold that lies at the end, though your path won’t be that of a rainbow but will instead be one cracking with flaming coals. Ultimately, it’s really about discovering what’s your calling ( so cliche, urgh!), and for those who already know, to challenge yourself to how far you can go. If you are in doubt, I think the worst thing that you can do is to not even try. A lifetime of looking back and “What if?” is truly sorrowful and real shameful, I think. To pull through it all requires strong conviction, but to leave it halfway is also by no means shameful nor disgraceful at all. My answer to those who are unsure - just jump in! Even if it’s not for you and eventually “waste one semester or two”, it’s not going to matter in the long scheme of things when you think about how long you actually have ahead of you. At the end of the day, it’s what you’ve learnt that really matters and not so much about the rat race. I actually intend to flame the curriculum more, but I think proceeding further would scare off all the architects-wanna-be, so I think I’ll hold back for now. Maybe, in another post. All in all, I hope the “real-ness” in this post is of benefit to whoever who is intending to pursue architecture in NUS, and at the same time, a ray of hope for a more enjoyable learning experience for my fellow friends struggling in this challenging course.

98211,"TL;DR - Daughter who can't stand living with mom anymore, just need to rantMy parents got divorced when I was 13, and it had a really bad impact on me, mentally and emotionally if it makes sense. I wouldn't say that I suffer from anxiety/depression etc. because I was never diagnosed and I don't wish to downplay the shit that people who do suffer from them go through. However, the emotional turmoil I was put through, did cause a lot of self-harm to happen, a lot of insecurities, a lot of just me trying to find a new identity and adapt to a new life without a happy family. A lot of these thoughts still surface even now.  My closest friends would have heard me talking about that one scene that replays in my head every now and then, of my father (one who never ever cries) choking up while wrapping my textbooks for me, while my mother packed her things in the room to move out. My dad loved and still loves my mom, the way he looked at her even now when we do meet, the way he always reminded me to listen and help my mom out because I'm the eldest. He loves her so much, but she left him because she didn't want to be with a ""poor"" man. Because I know how much my dad loves her and how much he would sacrifice his entire life just for her, that's why I hated my mom when she divorced my dad. We then moved out together, my mom got our custody and my dad didn't fight it because he didn't want my mom to go through so much. The relationship my mom and I had was horrible, I wouldn't talk to her, and I hated the sight of her. To me, she's a hypocrite who's nice only when people are around, she's nice to her friends and their kids, but doesn't treat us like humans when we're home. She does provide a roof over our heads, feeds us occasionally, but is she really a good mom if half the time she's losing her temper at us for things that were not our fault? Is she really a good mom if she hurls vulgarities at you when you were only 14, just because you didn't pack your school bag the night before? Is she a good mom if she calls you names and says ""I wanna kill you with a cleaver""? I lived with her horrible temper for close to 10 years. Even when things got better between us when I graduated from University, I would still stay out till 11 pm just to avoid having to speak to her or see her. The problem is, we share the same room and bed, so I have no choice but to face her everyday. I don't even have any sort of privacy or time alone in my room because we share a room AND BED?! uGH. For many years, I've yearned to move out on my own because dealing with her was so taxing on my mental health. I've tried taking my life a few times but failed because I always thought of my dad right before I take any action. Now that there's COVID, I've had to face her every single day at home because both of us work from home.. I am reaching my limit and I don't know how long I can deal with this. I wanna move out but rent is so expensive, but if I don't, I have to deal with her temper, insults, and ridiculous antics like buying appliances worth $5000 when she has no money and then borrowing money from us. If only there was a way to get rich quick, if only a kind soul would rent her room out to me for $100 or less, if only I was never born.. What would you do if you were me? with a measly 2.8k pay, a future to save for, and expenses to pay for? Anybody wanna take in someone who's about to lose her mind?-#98211: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98211","['Care: 14 people', 'Like: 7 people', 'Sad: 7 people']",10 comments,1 share
98209,"I first noticed you when we shared a lift heading to the first floor of our HDB flat. And just so happens that we were both headed to the MRT station, presumably to take the train to work.Since then I started looking out for you either during the morning walk to the MRT station or if we happened to be on the same MRT home in the evening, then sort of walk home together although it was a mostly one-sided experience. Although we're both constantly masked up, I can imagine how you look like underneath the mask. Your luminescent eyes your neat ponytail, your prim office clothing, your Michael Kors work bag. I notice them every time I see you. You probably never noticed me, just a regular guy in specs and office wear.Finally after weeks of occasional encounters, I decided that if I ever chanced upon you on the way home, I'll try to talk to you in the lift on the way up - elevator conversation?One fine day, that chance finally arrived. I noticed you in the neighbouring carriage of the MRT in the evening, and I thought, ""Yes, this will be my day."" Usually, I would keep my distance slightly behind you for the entire walk home, and never entering the same lift as you. But today was different. For the final stretch I paced myself a little faster to ensure that I'd be in the same lift as you. As we waited for the lift to come to the first floor, I practised mentally what line I'll open with.. Several possibilities popped up in my mind and as the ""ding"" sounded, I settled on the very first line I thought of.As the doors opened, my hopes were dashed as I saw a familiar face emerge from behind the lift doors.

At first, I was patient and would try my best to listen to her to create a win-win scenario. However, as the months go by, the fights are more and more frequent. It has gotten to the point where I get triggered whenever we fight and lose the ability to be rational & talk things out calmly.

Sex won't fix you because you're not broken in the first place.Best way to explain things:Heterosexual: door swings one wayHomosexual: the door swings the other wayBisexual: door swings both ways Pansexual: it’s a revolving door Demisexual: the door is locked and only one person has the key Asexual: the door is actually a wall, has nothing to do with whatever direction it swings in.Basically kissing a person is no different than kissing a wall.

I have no problem with coding and my worry is only about math.2) I understand that the program is rigorous but I want also to have a social life to a certain degree. I tried to look for students' experience about the program but couldn't find much.

98198,"Thoughts on my situationI am a y4 students who is graduating soon, but an incident has left a bitter taste in my uni life, and with my educational journey coming to an end, I felt a need to highlight this just to get some opinions to get some closure and perhaps shed some light on how NUS handles unforeseen events.I applied for exchange to a particular university, which was cancelled (before covid) due to certain external and unforeseen events. For some reason, I was only informed of the cancellation very late (one week into the semester). Modreg was already in round 3 or completely over and i was left to choose only from modules that had vacancies left. A NUS staff was supposed to help with securing of modules, but nothing could be done to add a vacancy for any module I had planned to take. To put it simply, I could not study the specialization I was interested in anymore due to this. In addition, the profs in the modules I took did not upload any webcasts and when I approached them during to ask for any material or recording, they simply asked me to get help from a friend and…all my friends were taking other modules. With the very late start to the semester which was extremely stressful, the lack of help from the teaching staff made it worse. I was struggling a lot and ended up doing worse than normal. I could not su the mods I did badly for and it ended up affecting my cap pretty badly. I was in contact with school staff during the semester and tried many times to ask for some sort of help or leniency in the form of getting the modules I intended to study or in the form of SUs, but all my requests were met with one final reply that “my academic excellence is my own responsibility”. My emails were ignored from then on.The fact that the entire NUS cohort had 10MCs during the first covid sem always made me wonder why I was given zero help in my situation. I’ve already graduated and all, so I’m not asking for pity or for my grades to be changed. I just wanna hear opinions from different people. Should NUS have intervened and done something about it, or should I have just sucked it up from the beginning?

98187,"I am feeling very hurt by my girlfriend's actions. Wanted an objective third party opinion on whether it is valid for me to feel this way or not?My girlfriend and I currently live overseas due to uni. She is very well traveled and has already been to 70 countries which is a lot for early twenties. I have only been to 6 countries. First times are very important to me and I feel that going to somewhere for the first time is very different from repeating. Of course, a third time can be a lot better than a first time as the company is ultimately more important. But with the same company, the first time together to that place, will almost definitely be better. She knows this is how I feel. I am also aware of her extensive travel history when we first got together two years ago and mentioned I hope she can leave interesting new places for us to experience together for the first time.A bit over a year ago, she travelled somewhere overseas brand new with a friend, fully well knowing that I wanted to go there with her. I wasn't very happy but did not say much. This confession here is also not about that trip, this info is just for context. I expressed my views again but she snapped at me, so I let it rest. Recently, I mentioned a place I wanted to go with her which was not far from where we live. She agreed. Earlier today she told me she has just booked a day road trip with friends there. I was very hurt, it was the exact place I wanted to go together with her. Her only response was 1) get over it 2) don't waste my time on silly things 3) there are 2 beaches in that region how can i save all for you when you did not even mention which specific beach when you mentioned that place 4) I can't go the other beach because my friend already going there another time so she wants to go to this one 5) we booked and the tickets are non refundable.Her response only made me feel even worse and even more invisible. Firstly to me, it was not so hard to just ask me which beach given I mentioned this region to her even before they planned this road trip, it takes a few seconds to ask me. Secondly the other beach is a shithole. Thirdly the tickets for the train ride isn't even that expensive, like 30 dollars with student discount, and my girlfriend is the sort who will drop 2000 dollars on a handbag. Fourthly, there are really not many places we can go to near us which are nice, and this is one of very few options we can go to brand new together. Fiftly, she just blew me off again when I expressed these to her, telling me I am the one being hurtful because I am not supportive of her, flipping the tables onto me. She even started insulting me and hurting me further.To me, half the reason I am upset is the incident above. I felt she was very inconsiderate and did not care at all about how I feel. It's almost like she prioritizes her friends over me. Also she told me I am not invited. The other half of the reason I am upset is the way she responded when I told her I was hurt by her actions. Instead of hearing me, instead of suggesting any solutions, she chose to ignore every single point or query I had, and chose instead to attack me, and hurt me further. She chose to start a fight instead of caring. To me, this bodes very badly for the future of this relationship.Am I over-reacting? What would you have done in my shoes? What solutions do you think might work going forward in this case?-#98187: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98187","['Like: 21 people', 'Sad: 20 people', 'Care: 11 people']",72 comments,8 shares

98179,"Hey all, need your objective critique on a semi-life decision. What would YOU do in my situationSummary of events chronological order:I was a broke and angsty 16 yo girl with no parents - no financial help, had to rent rooms all the while maintaining a FT job on weekdays and PT jobs on weekends. Admitted into NUS, with highest tier of financial help because the school understood my situation. Repressed and ignored my feelings of envious, jealousy when girls or boys my age had warm families to return to even if they didn’t have wealth. I had neither of each. Entered world of sugardaddies but never had sex until recently (3 years later)Trauma and abuse from an SD/ bf which helped me as much as he harmed me. Accumulated decent wealth and CPF and employment prospects currently. Although I was admitted to the doctors a couple times for being overworked. Until today, I ignore the scars left on me, I was abandoned, defiled and raped but no one can tell my situation from the outside. I “look” rich, well-travelled and happy with family and friends.So, recently I got a marriage proposal from someone I know for a long time (he is a good man, with strong morals and ethics). His and my goals are aligned in starting a family and building a home together. He is a multi-millionaire too which he mentioned he can solve my problems if required. But the problem is, based on the trauma and experiences I have - I don’t want to give up my independence or “hustling” mentality to settle for someone who might disappoint me in the future. I’d be trading my youth, time and energy for security and money (which I need). I am only 22 btw. What would you do?

98148,"tl;dr  peeked at close friend’s personal diary and realize she’s been bitching about me. AITA? Ok so I had a v close friend in Uni who I really trusted w all my darkest secrets and she supported me lot through past few yrs. I struggle a lot w low mood and suicidal thoughts and generally poor mental health and she used to be super present and supportive and encouraging and caring, often checking in on me esp when I’m MIA. Over time she became more distant and I just thought as she being busy with her own life. Recently I hung out w her and she lend me her laptop to finish some work. She left a tab to her private online journal open and I cannot resist to take a quick peek. To my horror, she had been bitching about me and thinking badly of me for a long time now. Writing stuff like “I’m annoyed with xx” “I’ve no more patience and sympathy for xx” “I can’t find it in me to care about xx anymore“ “I need to avoid xx for a bit” etc. She dates her entries and when I compare the date/time of them to her messages to me, right after each badmouth entry, she sends some kind and loving text to see if I been ok. I tried giving benefit of doubt that she had her right to her own reactions etc. but since realizing this I can’t help but think how much a double faced hypocrite she is and feel I can no longer trust her or believe in her concern to me. And that’s vv sad for me. I know it was wrong of me to look at her private thoughts. But also I feel she shouldn’t have been so fakeass two face w me??

98144,"Dear moderator, seeking opinions on how to manage university life and group mates.I didn't go orientation and formed a clique with a few hardworking PRCs, doing group projects etc. Initially in year 1, it went well, constructive projects. However, this year 2, it got real competitive. When they asked, I shared my google doc lecture and textbook notes with them, and they used it to create their own study materials. However, when I asked to share, they were uncomfortable so i did not probe further. They were also using my notes to reply during tutorials, but i think they may have also read the textbooks.I dont experience this non-reciprocation in my elective modules. My sociology module friends also shared notes, and even highlights on readings, which i am very thankful for. I am wondering if it is my major that is competitive? or is it uni in general?

Were you the one who compromised just to stop the fight?*What do you lose if you breakup with Guy A, you are lucky there is a Guy B ready as your ""spare tire""*Is Guy A willing to drop what he is doing if you need him?

98137,"Recently met up with a Vietnam Lady who became a Singaporean at some Massage Parlour and after our session ended, we both exchanged numbers and things between us took off to a great hit. We were constantly messaging one another and sharing about our lives. She told me about her past, why she is doing this job, her family stories and all. She even said that she was interested in me and liked me but we should take things slowly as she still had some issues to settle. We agreed upon that and everything between us was going well till we decided to meet up one evening after she ended work. During the meeting, she was clingy and just as per her usual self. We spent about near three hours together before i sent her back home. But since then, she has started avoiding me and doesn't message me even when i do so. She claims to be busy but is always online. It is hardly even two proper messages that i receive from her per day. This is very heartbreaking after all that she has said earlier and suddenly her actions are such now. I even asked her if i did anything wrong during the meet up but she said as nothing.

98133,"To the OP who had a fallout with his/her parents or anyone in situations that cannot be changed.I have found these tricks useful in dissolving my own internal conflict. It may not solve the problem but at least made me at peace.1) satisfy yourself at 60% and then others (including parents/children) at 40%. Do not go the other way around (mothers tend to) and make yourself bitter and everyone bears the brunt. This 60-40 rule can be applied even for 2 mins. Imagine your kids are making a huge mess and the laundry is piling etc. Ask yourself how can I satisfy myself using the 60-40 rule in this very minute. Practice and slowly expand it into larger time chunks. For instance June holidays. How can I plan my schedule, work full time, do housework and care for the children all at the same time using the 60-40 rule? One way would be to offload some chores to your husband. If your husband refuse to help, ask him to hire a helper. If he refuses to help and refuses to help pay for the helper then either pay for the helper yourself or maybe learn to live with a messier house. Do things your way to the best of the situation.2) when 1) does not work. You try to make the best of the situation and still you can't get over it. I am a Buddhist. Buddhist teach karma. My mum says hurtful things. I used to get upset but not anymore. I tell myself that I owe her some karmic debt and must pay back this life. So I suck it up.Be careful not to over include problems as karma. How do you determine karma? Simple. A persistent problem is a sign of karma. E. G. Difficult relationships, problematic character flaw, constant financial woes.Whether karma exist or not is not the question here. These 2 ways are merely methods to help you become at peace.What's the benefit or making a scene? The one who caused the scene is always the one left worst off.. Yes not worse off but worst off. Bcus that person will feel worse off than before and carry the shame of causing a scene.-#98133: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98133","['Like: 6 people', 'Wow: 2 people']",0 Comments,3 shares

98126,"To the girl who posted about the loss of sex drive after breakup: I'm not sure if it is common among females but I experienced the same thing too. I've experienced phases of very fluctuating sex drive throughout my dating life and at times questioned the same as you. I've come to realize sometimes it has less to do with the physical performance and more with the psychological triggers you felt in the relationship. Also, our female hormones seem to play roulette on our lives quite often too. An experienced partner may know how to trigger and turn you on. But I would say it is good to explore yourself too, so your pleasure is not so dependent on others and will not seem like a hit and miss game. Guys are very good at this and they learned since early what they enjoy, hence they seem to have more stable sex drive. While we usually don't self-explore enough and hence rely more on the external factors to determine our sex drive instead of triggering it ourselves. About myself: since my last breakup I went through a ""dry"" period with low sex drive, then I got curious and started to experiment more with myself and I would say I'm more sexually active than ever, with or without a partner  Good luck.-#98126: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98126",['Like: 4 people'],0 Comments,2 comments

98122,"In response to the slut-shaming to post #97886 There are too many individuals who seem to think that they are entitled to name-calling without understanding a person’s story as well as the motivations behind their actions, as such I hope that perhaps reading this allows one to reconsider the very nature of judgement itself. Now, moving on to what the OP did: I think it would be fair to acknowledge that she has not only battled the feelings of lust but also tried to find an outlet on NUSWhispers to seek advice/rant and not once has she mentioned that she has committed the actual act of cheating on her current partner. Allow me to explain why her feelings of lust are not logically wrong. Dawn Maslar, a biologist professor mentions on her TED talk that the science of attraction is one that is based upon a chemical reaction. Lust is a feeling that is caused by both Testosterone and Estrogen in female and male bodies. Testosterone, while commonly mistaken for being a ‘male-only’ hormone, can be found in both female and male bodies and increases the sex drive in almost anyone upon the trigger of their 5 senses. As such, on the premise of science, can anyone still really blame one for having these feelings of lust? In fact, the moral penal code itself highlights varying levels of mens rea (intentions when committing the crime), and given that the thoughts of lust were purely in the OP’s head and actions were not taken, in the eyes of the law the OP is a free woman. Especially in accordance with the theory of concurrence, as the OP’s feelings of shame had prevented her from committing the actual physical act of cheating (actus rea), the OP’s act of abstaining from the physical act of cheating itself should be highly commendable.  Note that the OP mentioned in her very last line that she detests her thoughts of cheating. This indicates an acknowledgement on the OP’s part on the lack of morality of cheating itself. She knows cheating is wrong, and she even hates herself for thinking it. This is indicative of the moral state of the accused OP – she not only understood that her thoughts were wrong but she also had the self-restraint to withhold from committing the actual act of cheating. As such, how is it fair to condemn her for being a slut? While thinking of cheating itself might be a mental crime, it is perhaps a flaw in the law that mental crimes are perhaps the most difficult to convict. But honestly how many Jean Greys do we need to have in society to whistleblow? This then brings us to the moral question that extends from the very premise of what a ‘mental crime’ is. In fact, even masturbation itself could be considered as a mental crime, given that it requires some form of sexual stimulation (i.e mental, physical or emotional etc.) and coupled with the act of ‘mentally’ having intercourse or engaging in a sexual act with the person or persons of choice of whom one might not necessarily be in a relationship with. Consequently, is masturbation within the boundaries of a relationship wrong? Also if and when the individual engages in the act of masturbation towards a person of desire of whom he/her is not in a relationship with is it then wrong? A convenient paraphrase to this question might be - is it wrong to watch my favourite pornstar and get off? This is very much a question to be answered by both parties within the relationship. Some might find it alright, others might then deem it as a mental crime that is unforgivable. But the hard truth is that we are all humans powered by the basic instinct to procreate and are attracted by attractive things. If we are going to get real here and start dissing individuals for the numerous ‘mental crimes’ committed in their heads instead of taking constructive steps towards encouraging an individual who is already facing extant conflicting feelings of lust - there ought to be more shade being thrown upon these people who simply perceive situations at face value and decide to slut shame and name call. In fact, to take things into perspective, since lust is a mere feeling not only substantiated by science but also unable to be charged for in the eyes of the law, how is it that we as human beings somehow feel licensed to judge others for how they feel? Moreover, in accordance with this line of reasoning of it being alright to judge emotions, it is then fair to judge someone for feeling happy? Feeling sad? and the list goes on. The world itself is a dark enough place that operates on more than fifty shades of lust. Take for instance: The Bill Cliton affair with his young intern, the curious open marriage of Warren Buffett and the undeniable fact that Bill Gates kept his ex Ann Winblad close to him despite being married.In that light, there are numerous issues that toe the line when it comes to moral justice. But as a patron on NUSWhispers, it would be nice to have a baseline of moral decency and basic social grace to not appear like an ignorant name-calling fool before delving into the motivations behind an individual’s actions. Moreover, many might not understand that the power of name-calling is one that seems to condemn the one being named, but truly damns the namer. While there is an arguably a sick satisfaction in anger venting or whatever negative emotion being released in the process of calling someone a slut, the person who has been called a slut (the one being named) is not the only person being judged in the process. As the person calling ‘slut’ (the namer), might possibly be viewed by others as an aggressor and one who has an energy that is hardly positive as the general consensus of people who choose to name call are often that of persons who fail to examine beyond the surface.But if and when anyone would like to name-call, it would then be appropriate for one to be sure of the exact consequences of name-calling itself - not just to the one being name-called but also to the namer.-#98122: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98122",['Like: 4 people'],0 Comments,2 comments
98118,"AITA for being angry with my in-laws?  I was supposed to have dinner at my bff's place this weekend to celebrate her engagement. It has been more than a week since we last confirmed the plan and today my in-laws demanded that me and my husband go over to their place on the same day and cancel my plans. This is not the first time I had to cancel the plans that I have made with my friends just to attend their family dinner. Throughout our relationship I have never once been absent for any family gathering. I have drifted apart from some friends over the years due to differences in schedules and I also had to always cancel on them because of my in-laws' demanding behaviors. Tbh I feel bad about it.Last month I just had a talk with my husband regarding this when he asked why I haven't been meeting up with my friends. I was really disappointed that he didn't side with me this time. When any of their family members are not free, it's fine and they can just either postpone the date or go ahead without that person. But when it comes to me, nobody ever bothers to ask if I already had plans and demands me to prioritize them again and again. My in-laws are traditional people and they always emphasize that married women should prioritize her husband and in-laws. There was once when I was late for a dinner due to work and my in-laws sarcastically asked 'you're very busy hor?' But whenever they are late or suddenly cancel the dinner the day before when they have already made me cancel my plans, nobody bats an eye.

98103,"I have a question about blind rage. I don't know whether that's the correct term for it but maybe those with pschology background or have good relationship related wisdom can correct me.I get that in relationships people get upset and fight for things. Usually these fights are to make a certain aspect of the relationship better and they can get quite passionate and heated. Not ideal but hey, at least it is all for a good cause.The reason I ask about blind rage is I think my girlfriend switches into a different mode when angry. She will change topic multiple times, not respond to anything I say, and just blindly say things, scream, insult me and say all sorts of untrue things. It is like her goal is to inflict maximum damage, pain and hurt to me. Mind you this is not just for 5 minutes, it can last 2 weeks sort. Funny thing is probably 30 minutes in, she already forgot what she was fighting about, she just wants to fight for the sake of fighting. It is like some sort of vengeance thing, definitely not constructive, and definitely not for any cause or change she is passionate about. That's what I call blind rage.Almost everything the catalyst for this blind rage or should I say almost all our fights, is her being angry that I am upset or hurt by something she said or did. My girlfriend constantly tells me things like she is a very kind person, she is a person of good character. I find that very weird, like who says this kind of things, it is like she wants to label herself that way desperately. So I think if I tell her she did or said something unkind to me, that sort of threatens her self identity if that makes sense? This then becomes a sort of reflexive defense mechanism for her? I am no psychologist but 3 years of observing this has more or less convinced me this is what is happening.Sad part is I still don't know how to deal with her blind rage. Maybe if anyone knows the correct terminology for it, the internet can give me some ideas if it is a well studied mental condition. Of course any advice to make the situation better is also always welcome.-#98103: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98103",['No Reactions'],0 Comments,0 Shares

98101,"I started to date recently after being single for awhile. I am surprised how tolling a relationship could actually feel. I do like my bf that's why i decided to take the step and get into a relationship with him, however I feel like there's a difference in synergy.On his end, he really hopes that we can meet up as many times as we can, and spend more time together, which personally I do find that there's nothing wrong, since I also find that it's supposed to be normal to want to see/spend time with your S.O. On my end, I think it is also fine even if we don't meet up each other very often - we are both working adults and sometimes it is a little difficult to cater to the timing since my work ends slightly later than usual; but if we do make the plans to meet, I will definitely set aside my time to do so. In addition, as I do still have my other priorities (example family/religion) which I will place before our relationship, if the meetups were to fall on those dates, I made sure to suggest and commit for a different day if possible. This had also been communicated to him before, but overall i still get an inkling where he feels disregarded because of that (though he never explicitly mentioned), and I get afraid that he will misunderstand that I do not put in the effort to make the relationship work. And also on the other hand, I also feel tired pushing myself to go out on dates for long hours every week. But what can I do, I also want to make it work between us, so I still got to put in the effort on my end.We text daily as couples usually do, but sometimes I get uncomfortable when his text seems to insinuate sexual advances. He will mention about he misses me and can't wait to hug me/do ""naughty things"" etc. To set the record, I am okay with spending some physical time when we are together face to face, but I don't like to read about it in text, and I don't know how to respond to that. So when I read that, I just feel turned off and my replies subsequently will get very 敷衍 (""Perfunctory""), like ""Oh. Okay haha"". Which then again I will get worried that he thinks I'm not putting in the effort. I could see from his standpoint why he would send that to me, his love language is physical touch, and this form of writing is also his way of expressing that he loves and cares about me, but I feel uncomfortable about that way of expression... To me, just a ""I miss you, baby"" is sweet enough, and anything after that can be omitted to when we meet face to face. Otherwise I just feel like an object of sexual gratification lol. I am slightly hesitant to tell him about it because there was once where I offered my POV for a certain action via text, he did not took it very well immediately and felt like that was a form of rejection, of course after a night of rest, we managed to sort it out in the day. But it makes me feel like I will need to be very tactful in expressing my views on the issue, without making it sound like a rejection. So I had yet to tell him about this yet, still formulating a reply to either talk about this the next time he text me something similar, or to save it till we meet face to face.Really not sure if I'm thinking too much into this.-#98101: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98101",['No Reactions'],1 comment,1 share
98095,"As a graduate of NUS who has entered into the workforce several years ago, I must say I am highly disappointed with the quality of interns that I am getting from one of our fellow local universities. While a student in NUS, I often felt there was comparisons drawn between ourselves and students from this said university - let’s call it University X. We were told, as students, that graduates of University X were arguably more charismatic, “hungry” for progression, had more quality presentation skills and overall better EQ. It was often the “coffeeshop” banter that NUS students, while strong in their academic quotient, may lack in EQ compared to their peers of University X. Now, I have had a string of interns from University X who have been assigned to our team, and I must say the experience has been exhausting at the very least.Out of many other observations, my biggest call out is the lack of respect and formalities - I’m all for a flat hierarchy, but that does not mean I place no importance on the value of respect to others. I think interns from this University seem to lack an understanding as to who is their “friend” and who is their “supervisior”. Call it what you will, but a flat hierarchy is more of a way of working - it does not negate the idea that we have an actual organisation structure in place with reporting lines. Simply put, they do not know when to put forward a professional front, and when to be appropriately casual. It is just a bit absurd to expect us at our mid management level to train someone who is an adult, in their 20s, on the basics of professional behaviour. Calling me your “pal” or “bud” when I’m your boss, sadly, does not fly. I’m not impressed by the “smoke and mirrors” of this said charming demeanour, when I feel it is a way to mask an obvious ineptitude in work quality. I have had interns from NUS, foreign universities and private universities who have never tried to skirt around this professional border, and always remained humble for learning and understanding.Disclaimer, this are views of my own experiences and I obviously know that not all students of this university behave this way. But I am just very upset that we NUS students were constantly belittled and compared to these peers of ours, when I have unfortunately yet to be impressed or proven wrong in my own experiences.My takeaway - give NUS students the recognition they deserve, and put a halt to this unnecessary comparison between us and those from University X.-#98095: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98095","['Like: 45 people', 'Haha: 13 people']",12 comments,5 shares
98092,"Tl;dr Born in a well-to-do family left me with an crooked view of money.My parents are business owners and they’re relatively well to do. They taught me to be humble and kept telling me “We’re really not rich.” since I was young and that’s how I acted during Sec and JC. I have been a good student, admitted to a high demand course in NUS, everything went smooth. People often say we can get a “prestigious high-flyer” job after I graduate. However, half way through my course, I realised the so called “prestigious jobs” did not offer as much as I thought. Put it this way, my parents claimed “We’re just normal middle class, by no means rich.” That puts an investment banking or FAANG salary+bonus+stocks at “poverty” level, at least for the first 15-20 years, unless you become an MD in the US. Even the career end-point salary (when reaching 40-50) is not as much as what I am used to.  My parents are proud that they achieved everything without my grandparents’ help, though my grandparents are pretty successful too. They expected me to be independent after graduation, which I had nothing against. I felt anxious and started to run my own business, from investors to investors. The precious takeaway from my parents was that I learnt how business owners think and how to avoid being cheated or scammed when doing things. This was the first time also, that I stopped caring about my grades. It is quite ironic that person who doesn’t need money is now worrying about $$$ the most, while my friends are enjoying their life in University. Some simply concluded my little success to “Of course parents money lah”. But that didn’t affect me and I had too little time to care. Not to sound like an asshole, but sometimes being born into a normal or below average family is a blessing. You won’t need a great amount of fortune to be happy.-#98092: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98092","['Like: 46 people', 'Wow: 5 people']",15 comments,10 shares
98088,"How do people here react if their significant other threatens them?When we have a disagreement, I am the sort who feel it is not productive to drag it on for days, and it is better to talk it out and end the fight in 5 minutes. My girlfriend though is the sort who wants to rage and ghost me, only to reappear to rage at me, then ghost me again, as she feels like, for days. She claims this is called giving her space.What really annoys me is that she will often tell me something like: ""Call me or text me one more time and I will block you. Stop ruining my day. I do not want to talk about this stupid thing! Keep your stupidity to yourself. I want no part of it."" And if I text her something like ""Can we please stop fighting?"" or ""Huh? What are you talking about?"" (if it was a misunderstanding), she will go through with her childish threat and block me for days.Is this even acceptable?!I always had the view that threatening people is a big no-no but when I tried to talk to her about it, her response was ""it is well within my rights to do whatever I want"" and ""you have no right to dictate that I cannot threaten or block you"" or ""I have no obligation to talk to you if I don't want to"".

98087,"Is it normal or unacceptable to raise one's voice when one is frustrated or very upset at one's partner?My gf has a fiery temper which is very easily triggered. Once triggered, she can be vindictive, can lie, can be verbally and emotionally abusive, and can be very unreasonable, cruel and hurtful, a 180 degree change from the happy cheerful person she often is. I on the other hand am more of the patient and calm type. I hate anger and I hate conflict.What usually happens is once my gf is triggered, she will spew insults and vulgarities at me. I will often try to be nice and patient and try to calm her down and reassure her or whatever it takes. Even as she insults me, I won't retaliate. However if she keeps at this for say twenty minutes non-stop, inevitably I will get fed up and raise my voice and ask her to please stop. Unfortunately this just triggers her even more and she will say ""I deserve better than to be shouted at"" and then up her attacks on me. Later on she will lie and claim that the only reason she attack me is because I raised my voice at her, ignoring the abuse she was giving me until I cannot stand it. She also conveniently ignores the fact that the only thing I shout at her is begging her to stop, while she can spend three whole hours hurling expletives and false accusations at me, just to rant.How to deal with an unreasonable gf like that?-#98087: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98087","['Like: 12 people', 'Care: 9 people', 'Haha: 7 people']",49 comments,3 shares
98086,"Is it normal to kinda lose your sex drive after breaking up? I'm asking because it's really been a long time and it doesn't seem like things are getting better or changing.So for background I'm 23F and graduating soon. I've had a couple of relationships, and I'm currently seeing someone but not really dating yet?Anyway the issue began after I broke up with my first boyfriend. Generally I felt that during that time my sex drive was kinda normal, maybe a bit lower than my bf at the time but nothing weird. Maybe once or twice a month kinda thing was comfortable?My next relationship was this Chinese guy fling I met on tinder before I got into uni, he was in NS and a couple years older than me and this is where I found my sex drive went way up to like almost regular weekly sessions or sometimes more when he could get over (he stayed out). He'd come over or we'd go over to some hotel just to have sex and I felt like I was almost always horny with him. He was I'd say very above average in bedroom-relevant size and I mean even though it was somewhat too large I still enjoyed myself in bed with him most times.After breaking up with him I seem to have lost almost all interest in sex, to the point where my last boyfriend complained that I was a tease and never in the mood. I kinda understand his point of view since I was really rarely in the mood and I think we always ended it with a blowjob, so I'm really worried going into my next relationship if having an abnormally low sex drive is acceptable? Or is there something wrong with me  I just don't get why I'm never in the mood now especially since I'm way less stressed now when I'm going to graduate compared to like before A levels and trying to get into uni.

98080,"Compassionate employers (or senior managers) are really a myth.... at the very least they are certainly VERY RARE. Had an accident which left me with physical constraints several years ago. But not THAT bad that I lost a limb or wheelchair bound. So, I still have a job and yearly appraisals were Meet Expectation. With the accident, I gave up all hope for promotion and was just very thankful that I still had a job. However, lately, I was told by my senior manager (or my boss, for want of a better word) that they (including my teammates) felt my stress and displeasure at my job. This was a great surprise to me as I neither felt stressed not displeasure. I am contented. Apparently, they feel that I am being paid 'too much' for the work I do. Never mind that I work longer hours (at my own cost...read: no OT or off-in-lieu) just to ensure that my work is done for the day. And organisations willing to accept 'disabled' persons? They do not exist. A person who is wheelchair bound or who has lost a limb stand a better chance of landing a job. Those of us who are not 100% 'normal but neither are we visibly disabled, stand no chance. Never mind that we are hard-workers and determined to contribute. NO ONE WILL GIVE US A CHANCE.

98072,"Am the person behind #98031, thanks for all the advice given. Kinda gave me the motivation to really work hard to save. I do freelance on the side too (I'm a creative) but because I'm such a junior in the industry, I barely get any clients, and even when I do, I have to lower my prices for someone to engage my service. But, whatevs, I still try my best and I try really hard to save. Like now that we are working from home, I often just buy cheap groceries and cook two meals a day, skipping breakfast. During CB I managed to save a 1.5k a month, but because I'm so bad with self-control, I ended up spending half of my measly savings on delivery food. Stupid.I actually put away $700 every month to save first and plan my finances according to whatever's left after deducting away the things I have to pay for. I ever tried asking my parents if I can defer giving allowance first but they weren't too happy with it, which is why I can only suck thumb and continue to contribute to family expenses. As for marriage, I really wanted to get marry early, maybe in 3-4 years time because both my bf and I don't fancy very happening weddings, we just wanna ROM and that's it, but I guess I had my priorities wrong. Also, he's actually pretty rich, he's just really thrifty, to the point where $5 takeaway food from the hawker centre is also expensive to him. I ever asked him if he could lend me some money to at least clear half my debt and he was pretty willing but I got a scolding from my parents and grandparents cos they said it's not nice to ask my bf for money when we're not married.In the end, my bf only has like 2-3k cash flow now cos all his money is in his endowment plan, investments, crypto and all that stuff lols. Don't need any advice this time, I guess I'll figure it out as long as I continue to be thrifty and careful with my money, but I just needed to get this off my chest, thanks bros and sis.Just wanna say that this all sux.

98071,Graduated from NUS in 2020 and had been working for about close to a year now. I want to start investing some money to grow my savings further and for future retirement purposes. I have zero investing b/g and not from biz/finance related degree but I do google and research online but there are far too many terminologies and types of investments which causes me to be overwhelmed by all the information. I am very prudent and have the habit of saving about half of my monthly salary (not alot only 3K+). I don't have any major commitments at the moment. My peers are also facing similar issues as me... I read that first timers should buy SSB as they are low risk. I am not a massive risk taker (e.g crypto) as I don't wish to see my hard earn money gone just like that but at the same time I also want my money to grow instead of just leaving it in multiplier savings account. Any experienced people or those who once been in my position willing to advise on how a beginner should proceed from here?

98067,"(Serious post: trolls expected but less, hopefully... please?)(29,M)Does anyone know if SDN events are useful and what is it like, or where I can try meeting people during COVID? I've tried dating apps for a couple of years and don't really see it going anywhere. Being a returning Singaporean, I don't have many friends locally and I don't want to try finding romance in my workplace so as to keep work and personal life apart. I'm also rather romantically unexperienced, having only had a very short relationship before in universityAbout myself for context: Graduated from a top university in Japan, I work in finance with a rather high pay, and also own my own property. I think I'm average looking with an average height and weight, quite introverted. I was a nerd in school but a sporty nerd, being in some athletic teams.I do get matches but it's nearly impossible to keep conversations going. Some are boring, some are outright creepy. I don't sext or anything, because I'm looking for a serious relationship. Most of the profiles (my age bracket) also do seem to have put in rather low effort: no descriptions ; horrible grammar/spelling; or one-liners like ""ask me yourself"" or ""I'm a potato"" (what???). I've even seen stuff like ""marry me pls if you're Lee Min Ho"", as well as dozens of insurance agents.For those where we made it to a date, it seems like some of them want dates to be absolutely perfect like some korean drama and they need to know if the person they are meeting is Mr Right just on the first date. Like some of them would compare our date to what they see their friends having on IG, and tell me, ""oh my friend's boyfriend brought her to xxxxx"" (I'm not even your boyfriend yet!) If it matters, I've always paid for or offered to pay for the first date, and turned up early to scout around. Even for those dates that turned out fine, she eventually ghosts me or I ghost them because I find them too talkative or clingy.I'm starting to feel the pressure to find my life partner because I see my friends getting married or welcoming children into their families, but I don't want to compromise either. I recently spoke with my ex-classmate who asked if I'm still single and when he could come to my wedding.If there is anyone else who lived overseas like me and doesn't have a strong ""Singapore network"" and could share some tips with me, I would be very grateful.

I realised that we should never have to rely on others to help with out problems, much less even tell them about it. Most of the comments here prove just that, people care about their own entertainment first and put their own beliefs above others instead of repectfully engaging in a discussion.

98060,"This is something I would like to rant about for the first time in 4 years of studying at NUS as an international student. First of all, I know y'all don't have a very good feeling toward international students and I perfectly understand that. And I also fully understand that international students are not the school's priority. So please don't bother with those comments because I don't give 2 shits about how yall feel about intl' students.But I think there is a certain line of respect that the school have to show to their students even if they are an international student. For those of you who don't know; all the intl students are like sitting ducks rn because the school haven't released whether it will be online or offline next sem. Yall might think what's the big deal about it and tbh for locals, it isn't much of a problem. But for intl students, it means we can't decide whether to stay in Singapore or go back to our home country and we have to wait on our expensive housing contract of at least 1k+ until the school makes a decision. You might say ""you can work during the hols to make up for it."" Well right now due to government policy, firms are simply not hiring intl students except for very special cases. You might say ""just take LOA"" but as an intl student, there is a VISA complication if you take LOA (I didn't know as well until I was told by CFG). So yeah the situation is tough for us but the only thing the school is saying is simply ""there is nothing we can do.""I know for sure at least one of you will say ""if you got an issue go back to your own country la, no one asked you to come here to take our job."" and I understand where that is coming from but that is not the point here.What I expect from the school is at least help the international students with the accommodation or at least announce that the exams and lessons will be done in an online format so we have an option to go back and don't waste our money.Sorry for the long post; I just wanted to rant about it since I am getting too depressed.

When we returned to school, we had lesson right after his at the same venue and my classmates introduced him to the rest of us. Besides that, I ran into him in school at different venues almost everyday (Coincidence 1). We started from a simple ""Hello/Bye Bye"" to a causal conversation and following each other on IG. I had a crush on him but I got to know that he had a girlfriend from his IG posts. I followed his posts and stories closely. I also got to know that we interned at the same location but different companies (Coincidence 2). After we graduated, I thought that it was impossible and hence I stopped thinking about him. Little did I expect to run into him again but in a different school. We were both in NUS (Coincidence 3). He initiated a conversation with me and we began to chat with each other occasionally on Telegram. He was still with his Girlfriend at that point of time. While chatting with him, I asked if his Girlfriend would mind that he kept chatting with other girls like me and he replied no. Recently, I'm doing my internship. As for him, he graduated and is working full-time. We increased our conversations by talking about our work. One day, he messaged me that he felt heartbroken because he broke up with his Girlfriend after so many years together because of her family issues. A few days later, he also told me that he let her go easily and he recovered from the break up very quickly (Question 1: Why did he let me know all these information?). Nevertheless, we began to chat even more till it became an everyday thing and I felt really drawn to him. Soon he kept asking me to go out with him (Question 2: Does he like me back?

I have close to 0 savings now because I contribute heavily to my family's expenses + my own expenses.

When those thoughts surface, I force myself to not think of it, I distract myself, and I try my hardest to stop thinking of that guy I met. Do you see that? You don't. The person who told me not to use the word love again, maybe after all that I've gone through, I know the word love more than you will ever know. I come from a broken family, I got raped, played by men, degraded, insulted, and trampled on, and now that I finally met a guy who truly loved me, even when I was so undeserving of his love, he taught me how to be a good person, he picked me up, and his selfless love really pushes me to change. Disgusting thoughts like this can't go away overnight, but I am trying my hardest, and I never acted upon my thoughts. Do you see that? You don't. I used NUSWhispers simply as a platform to get it off my chest as I go on my journey of finding myself again and getting rid of those thoughts, but so many of you took this chance to insult me and make me feel less than of you. This is how disgusting humans have become. You choose to see what you want to see, instead of seeing how angry I am at myself (which I stated at the end of the post), you chose to hate on me when you could have encouraged me and gave me constructive criticisms. Y'all are even more disgusting than my thoughts.-#98030: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98030","['Like: 42 people', 'Care: 35 people', 'Haha: 17 people']",34 comments,2 shares

98015,"Not sure if this Confession makes sense. Not sure if I need any advise even. Just something that has been bothering me. I am a guy. Few years back, hooked up with a girl in club. That was my first time about to have sex. She was pretty, figure was above average as well. Checked into hotel, excited, nervous, felt like a king inside. After foreplay, did I manage to have sex? No. I tried. I was hurting. My foreskin was not fully able to retract. I stop the session and apologies to her. She laughed and we just hug each other to sleep. Whole night we have been kissing. That’s pretty much it. We exchange numbers and kept in contact. Texted each other everyday. After that incident, I retract my foreskin fully, so that I can have sex with her LOL. Subsequently, we became FWB. Soon, we decided to do things other than sex. Movies, shopping, cafe dates etc, basically what couples do. I enjoyed every moment with her, I then realised I fell for her. Did I confess to her during that time, Yes. Did she became my gf. No. Various reasons, time not right, she enjoys this moment etc. Our relationship ended close to 2 years. How did it end, she told me we need to stop this as she got pregnant. The baby was not mine. She was certain. She even show me the blood test report, was with another guy. I was heartbroken. At that point of time, I hoped it would be mine. I even told her to get an abortion. All kinds of reason to keep her. She was unwilling. Our relationship came to an end. She got married eventually.Fast forward today. I am actually in a relationship for 2 years. A loving girlfriend. More pretty and hot than my first and only FWB. Both of us have good income, good vibes, good relationship. I can foresee starting a family with her in the near future. However, just a part of me here and there reminds me of my FWB. I still check on her once every few months on ig or fb. I blocked her, but when I think of her I unblock and check on her. Every time I look at her photo, memories still lingers on. I know this is definitely not right. I know this is bad for sure. My best friends know this. They told me maybe it was my first sex, my first time in love. My first date. I did alot of first time with her. I do know that I got played by her. I was her sex toy or object wadever. I do know that my current girlfriend is 10x better in all aspect. But yea, just a part of me can’t forget this. Maybe like what my friend said, I did not have a good closure. My friend ask questions that stun me. “Would you be together with her or your current girlfriend given a chance”. “Would you do better to keep your FWB”. “Would you want to meet her for a closure?” I got so tempted to text her to ask her out. But nope I din’t. And never would I do that.That’s all guys. Just wanted to vent out my feelings. Sorry for the long post. Just another loser that falls in love with FWB and got played hahaha.

Because my belief is that there needs to be a common spoken understanding and promise to each other first, before the subsequent step of looking for a home and leading our lives together.That would bring more sincerity, not just, ""eh want to bto?"" and consider it as proposal or propose after, which makes the whole knee-bending event less meaningful cuz will the girl say no when already in that proposition?Because of age, time constrain and a good location in this May launch, i decided to be practical and went ahead to apply for it.

97994,"Often we hear ""it takes a village to raise a child"". But what has happened to the vilage of today? Many people nowadays prefer less trouble because of the consequences should social media be involved, and maybe the hassle that comes with disciplining a child who has parents with an abundance of resources to come after you should their child feel a slight sense of unhappiness.Let's look at a very common example if you are willing to indulge in me:A child/teenager litters or drops food by accident (and decides he is not going to eat it anymore) and is schooled by an adult. Shouldn't the parent be thankful that someone is helping them to teach your child when they are not available? If the boy was asked to pick up the litter, and he doesn't, isn't it clear that the parent's teachings are not significant enough (if he was taught) for him to refuse/ignore the request? And if he was made to pick up the litter, but picks up only a fraction of those which could be picked up easily, isn't it blatantly obvious that he does not really know about the correct social behaviour (or even refuses to behave in that manner)?For me, as an educator, my job is to educate not just in terms of knowledge about the subjects I teach such as Math or Malay Language, but in terms of character as well. Let's say I were to encounter your son in the example above or even in some other examples of behavioural issues. These are the things I want to say to parents or parents-to-be:If I discipline your child, I mean well, and it will be in a way that your child will listen to and not just say ""yes"" and get back to his old ways almost instantaneously. If your child feels upset from his or her encounter with me because of things I say, I will say that is because your child has internalised what I have told them, which is why they will feel upset: because they will sorry about what they have done. If your child leaves the encounter aloof, it means the encounter has no effect on your child, and I will humbly admit that my talk with your child has no effect. If your child leaves the encounter happy, something must be wrong. If I bring you, as parents, into the picture, it is for your child to think about you and your family. Because for me to discipline a student that I have not seen or taught before, let's agree I will have no rapport, and the only way to make him consider about what I say is to invoke the connection he has with you. If I ask your child if you have taught your child on whether we should clean up after ourselves, I am not doubting what you have taught them, neither am I insinuating anything. I am just clarifying, because if you have taught him, I will question why is he not following your teachings? If you have not taught him, then I will teach him so he will know what to do the next time.Why do I say these? Because many parents are now seeing that they need to make up for the lack of time with their children by being their knights in shining armour. They jump to the defence of the child instantly and fault the teachers by twisting the words of teachers (or maybe the child twisted it). The moment I mention that child's parents, the parents imemdiately think they are being targetted (maybe because of a guilty conscience of not spending enough time with their child?) Take a moment to think about it: if teachers do not care, why would we bother ourselves with things that may subject ourselves to possible complaints? We are so busy all the time, why would we spend precious time disciplining a student that is not in our own form classes? Take another moment to think: if people can have many faces towards different people, can't your child act differently at home and in school?It does not help that some schools tend to be on the parents' side because schools function like businesses nowadays. ""The customer is always right"" attitude should never be adopted in schools. In short, teachers get thrown under the bus, and once the bus rolls over the teacher like a hump, the teacher has to crawl to the front of the bus and say, ""I'm sorry for making your journey an uncomfortable one.""I feel that the village has really died with the development of city life.Dear fellow whisperers, I implore all of you to educate this educator on what I should do.

For context, I am an Electrical Engineering student looking to do my FYP in the area of robotics. I understand the FYP topics for robotics related FYP can be pretty advanced so I wanted to know if it's necessary for me to know most of the prerequisite theory & literature needed for the FYP? Or do we just have to learn along as I do my FYP?I understand there is an extensive range of tools & softwares that robotics related work rely on, for example, Robot Operating System (ROS), OpenCV, etc. I know some basic machine learning concepts from my involvement in a robotics CCA but just found out from one of the robotics professors that some of his work involves building machine learning algorithms from scratch or from some existing models, but tweaking them to suit the research objectives.I am just concerned that such FYP topics may be well beyond my capabilities & not sure if such rigour is actually normal/common in students doing their FYPs?I am really keen on the field of robotics & am not one to chicken out on things that require hard work. I just want to be realistic about the workload of FYP & my capabilities too.Hope anyone out there may be able to shed some light on how FYP works! Thank you!TLDR: How does FYP work?

Like your relatives at CNY. Take advice from people who actually had to sign and had discussed a pre nup, the discussions are fairly reasonable and nowhere near sensational and dramatized like romance movies.FYI, there is nothing wrong with saying you want a share of what your partner makes. The problem is not being upfront about it and coming up with reasons that don’t any sense. It has nothing to do with them people not trusting one another, there are situations where regardless of whether u trust someone with your life or not, you’re STILL going to have to do a pre nup. If you or your family do have assets, you’ll know how that involves more than just “trust” and “love” but also legally sound decisions depending on nationalities, countries and other legal implications in a marriage. But of course, no drama series go into that level of detail on what pre nups are really for. And to the smart Alec who wants to point out how assets are only 1 factor but there’s also salary - Auntie, if a few year’s salary can outweigh assets you don’t need to sign pre nup.

97948,"I am a millennial currently taking a 10 minutes break from work, happy to jump onto the bandwagon to talk about the hot topic of toxic boomers and Generation XSo first, this is the storyline we were made to believe in. The Baby Boomers (and Gen X) were a great generation. Born out of the post war era, they seize the opportunities at hand and lay the foundations of our modern world. We as millennials should appreciate them for that. Boomers? Industrious, tough, resourceful. Millennials? Whiny, weak, attention seeking, strawberry, avocadoHere's a response, these are some of the observations on the boomers and Gen X folks, most were gathered from the internet and social media, the millennial's best friend:- They are usually entitled troublemakers: ""Do you have a badge?""- They tend to be xenophobic, racist and sexist: ""I am from Hwa Chong JC and will never mix around with you guys because we’re so different""- They are easily offended: ""I take embrage at your first question""- They are quite ungrateful: ""Give one chicken wing take back whole chicken""And then the topics escalates:- They created an education system that results in graduates enter the workforce with uni student loan ranging from $20k to $200k- They created a housing system where housing affordability is at an all time low for even our first home- They leave behind a sizeable carbon footprint: Enough to warm the earth by 1.7 degrees celsius but not the cockles of our heartsI (and I meant the internet) don't mean to generalize but hey, millennials are strawberries is a generalization too.No wonder we are all have a varying degree of depression and mental health issues. Pls seek help when necessary, do post on NUSWhispers for encouragement and filter out the unnecessary opinions from the trolls. You deserve better than from attention seeking boomers looking for validation on how 'smart' they are. They do not speak all boomers. My biggest worry is that the world that we would inherit one day is a messy one. There is an unprecedented amount of issues that we will need to tackle: Xenophobia, racism, climate change, human rights, global food shortage, ageing population, broken healthcare system, rising income gap and the list goes on. Even today, we are living through one of the biggest crisis of our lifetime with no end in sight. Of course, boomers are not to be blamed in entirety, we are merely 'part of the system'.On a more encouraging note, this is a call for rally for millennials and Gen Z to take action through our own ways, and I wish we would be known for being the generation that solve these issues some day.Now, back to work and be the hardworking millennial I am.-#97948: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97948","['Like: 22 people', 'Love: 2 people']",0 Comments,1 share

97946,"Just my two cents on all the girls & NS talk.Firstly, I just want to say that I'm writing this to have an opinion-sharing discussion, just wanna know how others feel about my opinion, can even correct me if you don't agree with me, etc. (no fightings please and please don't try to force your opinions on anyone else).My stand? I'm do not support girls having to do mandatory NS.Reason? Firstly, I personally can totally imagine my monthly-mood-swing self to be pointing a gun at someone demanding they stfu or even myself rolling around in pain or just resorting to spending my whole day on the toilet during my period or when cramps are just so bad. I know that even if a new law comes out that says that girls must serve NS as well, it wouldn't affect me since I'm already past that age and it'll just affect my future child (if I even have one). I'm just saying, I hope people don't underestimate some females and their periods (I know not many have the same symptoms but I personally get really bad cramps sometimes and I just wanna kill everyone who comes within 2m of myself and I'm sure I'm not the only one who has bad cramps).Secondly, I personally feel that females are at a disadvantage when it comes to career progression. I know we talk so big about gender equality but honestly speaking (at least from my very limited experience), I don't see that many female managers (at least not in my last 2 and current workplaces). I mean, we surely can't deny that childbirth is indeed something that females have to consider in their career planning. If we have to take another 2 years of NS into the plan, wouldn't the average age of females during their first child birth increase? Wouldn't that just mean less childbirths? Anyway, these are just my 2 cents. Hoping to hear some more meaningful insights.-#97946: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97946",['Like: 9 people'],19 comments,3 shares

So naturally commenters will be hoping for responses from those at uni age or our seniors who have been through similar experiences. Of course, there's nothing inherently wrong with boomers or anyone else expressing advice. In fact, some of them do have useful advice based on their life experiences. The problem, however, is that many of these commenters are downright toxic and dismissive. Please la, different generations have their own struggles. We didn't walk ""10 miles in the snow"" to get to school but it doesn't mean we don't have legitimate troubles. To these people - instead of coming from an angle of condescension by default and trivializing the OP, or pulling out your favourite ""strawberry"" card, try some empathy for a change?

In fact he suggested it because he knows I have assets to protect & will go to my parents before him, unless we have a family. If you don’t want to sign one, it’s because you want a split of his or her money. Simple as that. It’s strange how people try to explain it away as that means the other party doesn’t love you, or how it’s insulting. If you love the person even if they had no assets, you’ll sign it. I know a few couples who signed with no hesitation and no drama, because you want to marry the person anyway and don’t care about their assets. It’s not wrong to not want to sign it, but just be upfront and honest and say “I think I deserve a share of your success for supporting you “. Don’t have to beat around the bush and say “it’s not that” and “money is not important” but at the same time refusing to sign one.-#97911: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97911",['Like: 92 people'],31 comments,11 shares

97890,"There are a few lapses that led to Covid 19 being seeded into the community which led to out of control outbreaks and the tightened restrictions today. These lapses are totally commonsensically preventable and it doesn't take a genius to realise what they are.1.Staff wear full PPE, but that PPE is not idiot proof. A fatigued tester may inadvertently  scratch his face with gloves on , or inadvertently touch the outside of his mask  or gown with bare hands... Mistakes do happen. Testers are human, you can't expect them to be 100% on the ball all the time, and it only takes one mistake and you have an epidemic on your hands. Given the thousands of imported cases, such an accident happening is statistically inevitable.2.the staff serving travellers are allowed to mingle and eat with people from the public. This one is self explanatory.3. Travellers serve SHN in places distant from the airport. Who is to say they will not infect the driver (who also comes from the community) or stop somewhere illegally to pee, etc?4.PCR test is not 100% accurate, yet authorities allow people who test negative to shortcut their SHN even though they may be false negative and still have the virus. Contrary to popular belief, a 99% accuracy(sensitivity)  does not mean that if you test 3 times on the same person , then the odds of him testing false negative is 1 in 1 million. It simply means that out of 100 patients rested, one will test false negative.All it takes is one person who slip out of the safety net, and the whole nation is screwed!It is not infeasible to make a safety net that is 99.99% foolproof. Here's what I think should have been done.The authorities should have made changi airport into a self contained facility. Turn changi airport into a self sufficient town with its own amenities, shopping mall  , gyms, parks ,libraries ( I think most already are there).All the staff and their families live on dormitories and converted hotels on site and nobody is allowed to leave. Only goods can go in and out, coz covid 19 is not transmitted by goods.All dedicated facilities for SHN must be located within the confines of the changi airport bubble, so that there is no risk of travellers infecting people on the way to SHN facility in town.Everybody who leaves changi airport must quarantine for 21 days. Travellers should be separated into cohorts according to the day of entry. There will be 21 cohorts, and each cohort will be served by a separate staff, and no intermingling between cohorts and staff serving each cohort is allowed. That way, there is absolutely no possibility for a traveller who has already served 20 days of quarantine, for example, to be infected by a staff member who recently served a traveller with just 1 day of quarantine.Everybody should strictly serve 21 days of quarantine, and there will be no exceptions.

We shared lots in common. I felt as though we were made for each other. You showed me love, like I have never experienced before. But from day 1, we knew we weren't ourselves to keep. And of course, the inevitable happened, when our minds finally got over our hearts to do the right thing. The truth is, one will never quite be oneself again after losing someone who meant a world. And J, you meant a world. You left more than footprints behind. You embedded pieces of yourself in my soul. Maybe the Universe has a reason for us to find each other. And maybe the Universe placed you in my life and then took you away, just to teach me things others cannot.I still walk the paths we used to walk, hoping I can catch up to the old us and tap us on the shoulder and say, ""hold on to this, cherish whatever time you have because this wont last forever."" No matter who you fall in love with, some people cut that deep. What cuts deeper is you acting like nothing has happened between us.

Understand it’s covid and like everyone is just trying to adjust. Students and Profs adjusting to the new online learning and teaching BUT shouldn’t NUS step up and try to help & listen to feedbacks and be more empathetic towards students. Firstly, I tried to convince myself that paying 9K for a sem is justifiable but I really can’t. Anw, I am a Singaporean and 9K is the amount after all that subsidies. Please hear me out! Because man, I only get to go back to school once every 2 week and I can’t even enjoy/ use the facilities. So it pains me to see how money is being ‘wasted’ and not properly utilised. I can’t imagine the coming sem being like this too. It’s really a burden for my family too. To add on why this 9K isn’t justifiable, my prof from SDE didn’t even bother teaching. Instead he just reuse and replay his 2019&2020 recording during our zoom lecture sessions. WTF! I don’t see how the profs can use such minimal effort to conduct online class. Does your prof come into zoom lecture and hit the replay button from his past lecture recording to teach? I understand how we should all be kinder and more accepting but again, this sheer laziness really doesn’t justify how learning should be done. Some students wrote into the school for actions to be done but they have been turned away. Secondly, regarding online examination, I am unsure why some prof doesn’t want to use examsoft aka examplify to conduct examination. This particular prof conducted an online open book examination with zoom proctoring. The instructions he gave were signs of loopholes for possible cheating and dishonesty. For instance when the exam ended at 12, he still allowed student to submit 30 mins later without penalising them. Some students even took the opportunity the resubmit their scripts online which made me ponder if they did cheat. (Tell me if my suspicion could be right?) I mean who knows if students use WhatsApp/ telegram to communicate since we were allow to take pictures for our scripts and send via these communication platform. Earlier last year, some students even got into a heated ‘debate’ with a prof regarding how he want to conduct the examination. People brag about how NUS is still one of the best uni in SG but really is it really that case? Should NUS readjust the school fees and conduct a fairer online exam should there be a need.

It’s been a year since I’ve joined my new company, and for the longest time I’ve even putting up with a toxic senior at work. I used to brush those feelings aside, and thought I was overthinking; but in recent times I’ve found that my instincts were right since Day 1. Working with this senior was an absolutely traumatising experience, because I felt that I was on the receiving end of workplace bullying.   Many times I’ve worked with her, she would snap at me when I’m explaining my work; she uses a sharp and discouraging tone at me and my ideas; nothing I did was right, nothing I said was right. And being new to the industry, and requiring technical help, I didn’t have the confidence to retaliate or stand up for myself. After a few nasty interactions she would then be nice and friendly with me, sending me confusing signals.In meetings she would try to shush me when I tried to speak up, and too every chance she could to put me down; I even suspected that she spoke ill to my boss behind my back, because my boss seemed to have such a negative impression of me even though I just joined the company. I genuinely think she exploited her position to put me in a bad light. Friends told me she was insecure and threatened, but what she did was absolutely unprofessional. Even when I asked for links for project documents (not confidential btw) to understand our team’s projects, she’ll be like “what information do you need for it? Why do you need it?”, as though she’s trying to keep me out. Today was the last straw, because I opened up her birthday message to me.  It said something along the lines of, how I’ve been having a tough time, and to go wherever I wanted and to do whatever I wanted. I found this absolutely passive aggressive, as though she’s trying to chase me out. It’s very inappropriate to talk to me, about me leaving the firm, when I clearly never brought this matter up. The worst of all, is that everyone else has such a good impression of her, so I’m dealing with this alone. The only thing worse that seeing a ghost, is to be the only person seeing the ghost.

Once I look up to him as someone who could make me feel protected and safe like heaven in his arms. Now, I've become too traumatized by him to the point that I no longer want to speak to him. Despite being traumatized by what he did to me, I really do miss his affection so much.  Unfortunately, he never did apologized to me ever.

97856,"NUS commencement ceremonyYesterday (20 May 2021), NUS has announced to hold the commencement ceremonies online instead of in-person for the class of 2020 and 2021. This is due to the rising number of covid-19 infection in Singapore since April this year. I agree with NUS that considering the tightened government measures and the health and safety of ourselves, family and friends who will be attending the ceremonies, it is in our best interests to not hold the in-person ceremonies as originally scheduled in June and July. However, I am disappointed in the way that NUS handled this. I listed down 3 reasons below:1. There were ample opportunities for NUS to hold the ceremonies for the class of 2020 in February and March 2021. During this period, there were few covid cases in Singapore, and the government has gradually permitted a larger group of social gathering. Two universities in Singapore, the SIT and SIM, had taken advantage of this opportunity and held in-person graduation ceremonies in this period. Knowing that the covid situation is fluid and can change quickly, NUS should quickly grab hold of the opportunity in February and March to hold the graduation ceremonies for the class of 2020. 2. For the class of 2021 whose graduation ceremonies were supposed to take place this year, NUS changed the graduation ceremonies to online instead of postponing it to a later date to see if the situation improves. This is unlike what NUS did for the class of 2020, where the graduation ceremonies were postponed for a year, and an attempt was made to hold it in January 2021 (which ultimately did not happen because of tight government measures) before the decision was made to change to the online ceremony.  I find it hard to understand why did NUS make the swift decision to hold online ceremonies for the class of 2021 where currently, the covid-19 vaccine is being rolled out and the covid situation could improve in a year, making in-person ceremonies possible. 3. Based on the swift decision that NUS made to hold online ceremonies for the class of 2021 and the responses from the NUS students that I gathered from social media, it is clear that NUS did not seek the opinion of the students, the people who the graduation is meant for, before deciding to hold online ceremonies.  Despite these disappointing observations, I am heartened to know that NUS students have already taken to an online platform, change.org, to get signatures to call for NUS to re-look at its decision. This shows that although NUS did not take the initiative to speak with students, the students are not willing to stay silent. They will speak up and continue to do so until NUS is willing to listen. This is not the first time that NUS students have turned to the online platform to raise issues that NUS overlooked. If you search on change.org alone, you will see several more examples. These are good signs since universities are places where students go to learn to think critically, not follow blindly.  All in all, I am disappointed in the way NUS handled the graduation ceremonies for the class of 2020 and 2021. NUS could have better manage this and many other past issues if they have communicated with students, and include student's opinions in their decision-making process. Moving forward, NUS should think of ways to communicate with students more often, such as holding meetings between students representatives and the management team every semester.-#97856: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97856","['Like: 14 people', 'Haha: 1 person']",2 comments,4 shares

If your bf has a so called like ""close sis"" friend who is always constantly concerning and asking about your bf's daily life and would spare time just to help him with his stuffs, do you think she is overdo-ing it? Btw she is married with 2 kids. Shouldnt she spend her time and energy on her family instead of caring and asking so much about other people's bf? My bf knew that i don't like about this and we had quite a few quarrels because of this issue. I said to him why cant you just tell her that you will be doing this with your gf or you will be doing this on your own and so she can just leave you alone and stop meddling so much? He keeps telling me this is the way she is and he cant stop people from doing what they want and they are just brother and sister.... thats all nothing more..can you guys tell me how you feel about this and have you also had the same experience as me?

97851,"I wonder how many people will attend the virtual commencement. For Class of 2020, it’s been almost a year since we received the certificate. Most of us have started working or proceeded with further studies. The ceremony is more of seeing your classmates again, going back to NUS one more time and reminiscing the undergraduate life. Of course, there could be other reasons, like for our families. I think we can safely say that the ceremony is more for the memories.We have waited this long, only to know NUS decides they opt for a virtual ceremony instead. I understand that the school has tried, and we appreciated that. Remember the thankful comments last year when they announced to hold a physical ceremony at a later date? But NUS has obviously given up trying at this point, which is why this is disappointing. I am not saying do the ceremony now. Instead, have it another time, when it’s safer.“What if it takes 3/4/5/6/7/8/9 years for things to be safer? The staff will suffer from organising the commencement. The hall isn’t big enough for this” Worst case scenario, it took us a few years to recover from COVID. There would be quite a lot of graduates but similarly we were having the ceremony in batches anyway. The number of virtual attendees could be way lesser. Easier to plan, but why are we taking the easy way out here? I foresee the virtual commencement can happen in 2 ways via zoom or whatever online platform:1. Default setting where you see the participants in boxes. People can choose to on their camera or not. Then the various speeches, followed by a roll call. Meanwhile, we just sit in front of the screen and listen. Why would people take time off their schedule for this experience? Puzzles me.2. Webinar style. Well this is probably worst. If there could be other ways a virtual commencement could be fun and celebratory, please share. I understand that not everyone wants to attend a commencement (virtual or physical). It is fine, but there are people that want to attend it. Having a virtual one removes the actual experience some of us were looking for. I know there is a petition going on, like last year, and hopefully our voices are heard.-#97851: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97851",['Like: 7 people'],0 Comments,2 shares

Been together with my bf for a year and honestly we don’t always go on dates very frequent due to our work and recently I have started my part-time degree. It is honestly a real struggle to juggle everything together, work school family and personal life. Sometimes I just have a breakdown you know but I keep it to myself. I would just cry silently to myself but I press on because I know this is what I want. At work, I try to be positive always. At home, I try to act like nothing happen. These few days, I’m just starting to have the thoughts of breaking up with my bf because I feel like he isn’t giving me the attention he used to give… I usually reply him fast but lately I’m just tired, tired of everything. I don’t know if I want to continue this but I’m scared that I will regret. Also, I’m not the type of speak up so I’m really scared how he would react. I feel like that it will be my fault. Anyway, we last met face to face last month. you know and i feel like i’m not important to him. it’s just that these past few days, the way we text, the way we treat each other is really not how we used to treat. is it normal for bf to not text you to ask how are you doing if i did not reply him???? i just wanted a comfort from him but he always don’t reply and wait for my reply only then he will reply. so if i stop, he will stop. i’m just really at this point that i want to not exist and just disappear and vanish. i don’t really know how i feel anymore.-#97845: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97845","['Like: 12 people', 'Care: 7 people', 'Sad: 5 people']",21 comments,2 shares

97843,"Holding our commencement ceremony online feels like a spit in our faces. Many of us has had a mentally tough 4 years, particularly in 2020. We do not seem to be getting any support from the school. They ask us to unite with the rest of Singapore, but NUS does not seem to be united with us. We are the batch who are the most affected by Covid-19. Our exchange were cancelled/recalled, our lessons were replaced with recordings (even lecturers uploading past semesters lecture recordings), we were restricted from even going to school. We were paying the same school fees nonetheless. Don’t we deserve at least a bit more from a university “consistently ranked amongst the world’s best”?Maybe this feels like an entitled opinion. But to have a virtual commencement feels like tokenism. It feels like NUS is taking the easy way out so as to no have to deal with administrative inconveniences of planning and holding a physical ceremony. We are students/alumnus, not customers. We are not buying the degree and formality. If we were really to have an online commencement, maybe it would be better off if NUS would just upload 2019’s commencement video onto Luminus for us to download like we do for lectures. We are used to it anyway. Those who want to can even watch it at 2x speed. Yes, we are in a global health crisis and there are many more pressing issues. We do not need the ceremonies to be held right now. The batch of 2020 have already waited excitedly for one year. I believe many of us are willing to wait longer, even if it is held in batches. A virtual commencement loses its significance even if traditional proceedings are retained. To the management team, perhaps you do not have children, perhaps none of your children have graduated, perhaps all have graduated. But for our parents, to miss out on seeing their child graduating in person, being relegated to watching a computer screen after investing so much does not seem fair. They have waited 23-26 years for this day. I’m sure even you  all had fond memories from your time in university and at your commencement ceremony when standing next to your loved ones wearing the gown. I am not asking it on behalf of us students, but for our parents for all their sacrifice. They deserve better.I really hope that NUS will reconsider this decision, and to not have the commencement online. Please do not deny us this proud once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Gave students 1 more semester of SU because teaching quality and mode of teaching and assessments were new2. Conducted Commencement for 2020 batch during Phase 3 as soon as they got the chance to, because Covid is an evolving situation3. Postponed Commencement for 2021 batch to later date because of the rise in cases and the importance of physical Commencement for both the students and the families4. Did not restrict students' access to the University facilities and Campus during Phase 2 so as not to cause too much inconvenience to students wanting to come to Campus and use facilities5. Did not result in Covid cluster although there were few students who were tested positiveNUS:1. No SU during 2021 Sem 1 because you have already gotten use to the past half-Semester of Zoom teachings2. Postponed Commencement for 2020 batch to coincide with 2021 Commencement, planned for 6 months after Phase 3 even though they have plenty of opportunity to conduct3. Cancelled both physical Commencement for 2020 and 2021 batches and transit to virtual instead, because it is not fair to postpone for 2021 batch but not 2020 batch, but hey let's just get these 2 batches over and done with even though there is a decent chance for 2021 Commencement to be conducted at a later date4. No students were allowed to come to school when they had no lessons during Phase 2. No students shall use the Campus's facilities and study in school if you do not have any lesson on that day. Hey let's slapped another Zoning restriction to prevent students from walking around in Campus. You want to go to UTown but were from Biz? Nah bro ain't letting you do so.5. Forces students to download a poorly-named App and to show a colored Pass whenever they want to buy food on Campus or take the shuttle bus. Never mind that our wifi sucks and some students could not connect to it at times. While we are at it, why not install a bunch of big TV screens in canteens to display ads, so that students cannot see the stall menu.6. Still results in cases of staff contracting Covid, but hey at least we have no cluster right because we were so smart in our restrictions.Obviously NUS has done nothing wrong and one can't fault NUS for these policies because the rationale is not wrong. Follow SOP and do things safely. However in doing so they have caused tons of frustrations and inconvenience to students and staff, while unilaterally implementing restrictive policies. One can't help but wonder that NTU's actions show more signs of taking students' welfare, convenience and university life into account compared to NUS, where it is not convincing to believe that NUS makes actions by taking into consideration the students first. Rather, it appears that all of NUS policies are designed to protect its image.- Just a disappointed NUS student who felt that NUS could have done better and not cause so much frustration and inconvenience to its students and staff in the name of protecting them-#97834: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97834","['Like: 67 people', 'Haha: 6 people']",0 Comments,8 shares
97832,"#97788: Thanks everyone for replying on your opinions about the prenuptial agreement. More background on what's happening - both me and my fiancé are local but my fiancé's mom is a westerner so a prenup is very important to her, which, oddly speaking she and her husband dont even have one and yet, she's asking her son to do one with me. So to further explain, I make 4k/month and my fiancé makes 12k/month. His mom thinks so highly of him and thinks he has a lot of money. I mean, if I was a mom who has a son doing so well in life I'd too also but his mom doesn't know the struggles his son is going through. We both have student loans, bills and family to support.. I never have any issues with him supporting his family, his brother especially since he is still in university and as a big brother, he wants to give his brother a good life and not go through hardship like we both did - working part time and studying while trying to get our degrees. We've been struggling to save for our wedding too, cutting down on our expenses etc. Actually in fact, his mom doesn't know a lot about our hardship the last 8 years. To her, her son is some sort of a star that she's always so proudly boasting on Facebook to her friends. Prenup is honestly just the tip of the iceberg on why I'm re-evaluating my decision if I want to continue the wedding. Despite being together for the last 8 years since I was 18, we only got engaged just last year in 2020 after I asked him if he had ever thought of marrying me? This is also mainly because my mom nagged at me for being in a relationship for too long haven't settle down yet. It also took him quite some time to tell his mom he proposed to me, which was a kind of pathetic the way he propose but I've learned to let go cause I don't want to be petty and hold grudge on how other people gets nice proposal but not me. His reason for not telling his mom because he dont want her to feel weirded out that we haven't live together but already considering settling down. There is a lot more actually but it'll be too long to list out what I'm feeling. So him mentioning prenups was honestly the last straw for me. I dont know if this is normal for couples to have so many arguments before the wedding or am I just unlucky? Sorry if it sound like I'm a brat but i'm just upset and wanted to voice out how I feel about my relationship and if I should continue this wedding or break it off before its too late. -#97832: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97832","['Like: 25 people', 'Sad: 12 people', 'Care: 11 people']",27 comments,3 shares

97823,"Hi all, I am from the class of 2020 and have just received the news regarding the virtual commencement. Suffice to say, I am extremely disappointed at how the situation turned out. I can't say the same for others but commencement to me was important for one main reason - it was a day dedicated to my parents. Raised from poor households, both of my parents couldn't afford to study, they were thrown into the low-skilled workforce at in their teens and have never looked back since. It would come as no surprise that they were often green with envy when looking at graduation photos of other families. It was then when I decided I needed to make their dreams come true, that this would (quite possibly) be one of the proudest moments they will be of me, when they would see me on stage, graduating with a degree they couldn't have attained themselves. To people who are gonna comment the following - here are my responses:""It's just a ceremony, they are already proud of you"": But the ceremony is monumental, it would really mean something to them ""You've already graduated, who even cares about it anymore"": I just feel that it's such a pity for my parents, I just feel that it's a missed once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make them happy""You could just take photos with your parents somewhere else"": That's exactly what we would do, but I feel that a huge part of the commencement experience would be lost if it's virtual.""Stop whining"": This post is all that I will rant about this matterIn conclusion, I just feel that making it virtual would mean that the commencement has lost a significant portion of meaning (for me at least), and that it would just be an easy way out for NUS.

97814,"Dear Student Union (NUSSU), I think it is evident from the sentiments of the graduates and soon-to-be graduates that the decision from the school administration was indeed a demoralising one. The prestige and traditions of such ceremonies have to be upheld - even if it needs to be further scaled-down (at later dates) or even postponement again during the December period. The decision has to be made with each cohort in mind, i.e. the Class of 2021 can still afford to see one cycle of postponement much like the decision from NTU. This is a lack of justifiable rationale for the present arrangement and a virtual commencement does not reflect the same prestige of in-person commencement. It does not absolutely make any sense to reinvent virtual ceremonies when the sentiments on the ground are disjointed, disappointment and frustration. There needs to be appropriate justice for the rigour one has taken in a one-in-a-lifetime milestone and after the financial sacrifices for many families alike. Commencement is not an event.

97801,"Dear admin, please disregard the previous post, as I've made some correction in my confession. Please post this version instead, thank you.Dear C, if you see this, I hope you'll learn from your mistakes, but I'm sorry that I can't be with you. Not because I have lost feelings for you, but because I can no longer see you the same anymore. After several weeks of meeting each other, I gave you my exclusivity by terminating my chats with other guys whom I met online. Despite how nice they were to me, I told myself to be fair to you as well, because I met you first, and your awesome treatment towards me deserved some respect from me. I asked you if you were still chatting with other dates or planning to meet them, but you said no, and continued dating me until the day we officially became a couple. After 3 weeks, you began acting cold towards me. You tend to take longer to reply to my messages, sometimes you even forgot to wish me goodnight and just headed to bed, and I could only accept the fact that you were tired and went to bed without overthinking too much. You went to meet your friends without asking me, though you knew I'd always say yes because I treat this as basic courtesy and respect between us, but now you just dropped me a text telling me that you're meeting your friends. You started using exam and CCA as excuses to stop meeting up with me for lunch, dinner, and even hanging out together, though I knew how little time you actually needed for that semester. Fast forward to a week later, you came clean to me by telling me that you shouldn't have been together with me, because some girls on dating app whom MIA you actually replied to your texts and initiated to meet up, and you guys were still in touch with each other. You said you just continued to text each other without meeting them in person and felt that they might be more suitable for you. I take this as emotional cheating, but whether or not you guys have met, though you said you haven't, this is no longer something that could hurt me more than your breakup with me.Several months later you texted me again, telling me that you still love me, just because you went out for dates with them and realized that they are not your type. I'm sorry, I'm not a replacement, I'm not an option for you to choose when you had no choice, I'm not somebody who can accept you whenever you are available for such ""good"" reason. You went out with them, you had fun with them, you texted them happily everyday, and lied to me about you only texting me exclusively. I thought that was a fair game where if I stopped texting and meeting other guys because I have decided to stay focused solely on you, then you should do the same for me too. Even if you didn't, you should have at least told me, and right now I just feel stupid for giving you such privilege. I could have continued meeting other guys, some of them are doing well in their career, some are better looking than you, but I chose you.C, to be very honest with you, I could see myself giving you a second chance if you were to apologize to me earlier when I was still contemplating to salvage this relationship, but not now when I'm enjoying being single without being hurt anymore. Please stop telling me how sorry you feel about this whole situation. There is no way I could see us getting together anymore. I hope you will learn from your mistake and avoid doing this to another decent girl that you'll meet next time.-#97801: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97801",['Like: 44 people'],11 comments,8 shares
97793,"To op#97747 TLDR: Don’t marry him if he does not make time for you. I am in the exact situation as you, but worse. We are married with 2 kids. He has no time for you now, much less for kids and you in future. Don’t hope. Open your eyes.  Similarly, mine is loyal. Stable job. But that’s all. We quarrel everyday. He scolds the kids everyday because they are too slow. He wants them to complete everything fast so that he can return to his phone. Eat, toilet, tv all need to use phone. He doesn’t care about spending time with me nor settling issues on house or kids. He does not cook, wash, help, plan.. and is contented to just be with his phone everyday. Birthday? Who cares! Confinement? Who cares! Kids need to pack bags? Who cares! Kids hungry? Who cares! Thinking of celebrating something? Who cares! Secretly.. what is worst for me.. is that I have explicitly stated that a certain part of my body is off limits during sex. I also made it overtly known I am uncomfortable with it. He still chooses to do what he likes. I don’t even know if this is assault. But who cares!We also did talk through, quarrel, plead, etc. Each time he will just apologise but you know, a leopard never changes its spots. I have tried to write down, remind, thank him each time he does something for us, in the hope he will realise it’s what works, but nothing can make it. All you want, and I want, is their effort. But no....Please leave while you can. You will never be happy with a guy who doesn’t know how to look at you. To look after you. To look out for you. And when there’s a family unit, it’s worse when you lose to the phone and his self-centredness.-#97793: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97793","['Like: 122 people', 'Sad: 68 people', 'Care: 62 people']",33 comments,39 shares

He said that he asked his parents about prenups and his mom asked him to do a prenup with me.. I got abit offended when he said that because I’ve been with him since I was 18 and he was in grad school. He didn’t had anything when we first started dating and I stayed and supported him financially and mentally till he became one of the best consultant out there… I understand that prenups is a contract between couples just incase one day we get a divorce and need to split asset… and yes, he makes 3X more than me but tbh, he don’t even own a house or a car etc… even his dad thinks it’s irrational to have a prenups when there isn’t any asset to split but the fact that his mom kept insisting him to have a prenup with me like as if her son is Bill Gates is just bizarre to me. Due to that, I’ve been very upset with him and really don’t feel like continuing this wedding. Am I being irrational with my feelings? I just felt like I can’t believe that he even have the thoughts of divorce or would think I would want all his money and assets if we ever did end up divorce.

97779,"My younger sister's boyfriend is someone whom I had (and still have) a crush on. What should I do?About 3 years ago, I have a crush on this guy (let's call him James). We went out on a date twice, but after that he ghost me. My friends advise me to move on and find another guy, and I tried to do that by making new friends with guys. A few guys asked me to be his girlfriend. However, I find myself rejecting all of their advances because I cannot forget my crush James, and I want to remain single and available for James if he ask me to be his girlfriend one day. Around two month back, my younger sister (who is my only sibling) brought home her boyfriend and to my surprise he is my crush! I don't understand why does my crush choose my sister over me as they have a big age gap (5 years) whereas we only have a age gap of 2 years. Since then, my crush will come over to our house for meal with our family regularly, and every time it is a painful experience for me, and I have to put on a 'happy face' in front of my family and my crush. To make matter worse, my sister also has sex with my crush in our bedroom (I share the same bedroom with my sister). At first, my sister only does the deed when me and my parents were out for work. However, after I caught them in the heat a few times when I returned home early from work, they became more daring and would do it even though I am at home. My parents are both essential workers with strict working hours so they can easily avoid my parents. I have tried to avoid meeting my crush in my house (and hearing them in their bedroom routine) as much as possible by going to my office. But from this week we are required to work from home. I dread seeing my crush but I cannot avoid him. I guess I am jealous over my sisters who can get the guy I want and also fulfill her sexual needs, while I am alone and lonely and sexually frustrated. To be honest, there were a few times where I thought about sabotaging my sister and my crush by telling my parents about what they did in our bedroom. I also have this evil idea of seducing my crush and stealing him away from my sister, such as changing my clothes in our bedroom when my crush is around. This thought scares me because I never know that I have the capacity to have such evil thoughts. In the end, I did not act on these ideas because I do not want to hurt my sister. I feel that ever since my sister brings my crush home and introduces him to my family, I have changed into a different person. I do not want these to continue.

97769,"People who are calling for another round of total CB lockdown is just plain ignorant and selfish. You can only see yourself enjoying the perks of WFH of getting paid while getting more personal time, less crowds for you to do your daily activities and commuting, or you’re just an introvert. What you don’t see are the hawkers in ulu areas closing their stalls after the entire day of selling only a few miserable bowls of noodles, barely making the rental let alone commissions for Grab or Foodpanda. What you don’t see are taxi uncles driving around the city from one end to the other frantically searching for customers and ending up trying to fight against one another for customers. What you don’t see are the retrenched retail staffs who are applying for 50 jobs a day while scrimp and save on their retrenchment package. It is unfortunate that we ended up in P2HA, but instead of asking how to implement draconian measures immediately, why don’t you look at how to plug the hole? Strict assessment on entry for every traveler regardless of residential status, why did the people leave in the first place knowing the pandemic is not under control? Other than compassionate reasons with proof, there is no other acceptable reason. And what’s with the constant strawman fallacy argument? No one is asking to close all the borders, only to those high-risk countries. You mean we rather suffer the economic losses from implementing lockdown than subsidizing cost of foreign workers from other lower risk countries? Why? Because some infamous words from random has-been or angmoh spectator trying to score internet points said so?Not poor enough to beg on the street and end up homeless but not earning enough having to scrimp and save to put food on the table for the family.

I get to choose an area that I am interested in. Cons of doing a dissertation:- Pretty useless since I am not doing any research nor do I plan to do a PhD. I am intending to help out in my family business once I finish my Masters- Might take a longer time than usual to graduate.

I find that he is already biased against me from the assumptions he would find opportunities to put me down.To provide some context, appraisal is coming up in my organisation. My appraiser rose through the ranks as career progression gives higher weight to staff who stays longer in the company.  Recently he made an untimely and unjustified feedback by making unfair statements (close to Appraisal) that I have not been tracking my work at all. I had to rope in my colleague to clarify that it's not the case. How ridiculous. For email write ups, he would write a LONG paragraph to highlight a one liner mistake, and use that as a justification to re-write everything. And yep, he will prob use that an excuse to give me a lower grade. I am wondering if he's insecure because of his 0% exposure private sector experience. He's also new to project managing and first time leading a small team.Last but not least, I found out that he was subtlety spreading gossip when he realised me and another colleague got along v well. I found out when that seniors' clique kept asking if that colleague of mine broke up and kept asking me if I was gg to be attached.

97744,"hello, 22F just graduated from NUS this sem. (first post pls b kind...) I actually stayed in hall the past 4 years with the exception of (Y3S1 and Y4S1). my last semester in hall was truly one of the worst ones yet. I spent over half the semester crying and only one hall friend who knew had so many commitments that I ended up telling him that I'd stop confiding in him only because he was so bad at replying and constantly flaked on our meetings. I did tell him that if he was free I would be more than happy to talk to him though.. anyways, I guess it must be a lil unexpected that someone who stayed in hall all 4 years of her uni life would feel so shit in the last semester but the main reason why it was so bad imo was because of the friendship problems I had to deal with. to give some context, there's this group of friends that I expected to hang out with since we will be in the same block. I've known them for the past few years but the problem is that they (along with some others) were already an established clique from the previous sem due to zoning and I was really quite worried before moving back as I didn't really know how I would fit in especially because I was on awkward terms with one of the ""some others"" in the clique. moving on the the actual situation of it all: I was actually quite optimistic at the start even though I'm not really the kind to approach others, I did warm up to the group in the first few weeks. something I noticed however was how they would gather in each others' rooms even tho I was in, they never really invited me to hang w them (note: safe distancing was practiced throughout the sem). I did ask my faculty friends about it and they told me that there's no harm just popping by or taking the initiative to ask what time they will be having dinner but honestly, its much easier for them as a group to invite me too because I was often afraid of intruding their time since they didn't invite me even though its so convenient for them to do so. everything was going fine until one night when I asked some of them individually if they will be having dinner that night and they all told me separately that they were either going out for dinner or already had plans. a while later that night I found out that the clique went out for dinner without inviting me but what hurt me the most was how none of them bothered to tell me that I had to make my own dinner plans since we would usually eat together. after that incident, I emotionally withdrew myself a lot and when I talked to one of them about my concerns and how I felt so far, I felt even more alone because it seemed as if everyone only cared about how uncomfortable the other guy seemed around me when he does join the group and no one ever bothered to empathise with how I felt hiding my feelings and pretending that I was okay whenever he was around so that the rest won't feel awkward. At one point of the convo, it felt as if I was the only problem there, causing all the ""weirdness"" and I just felt so bad about myself. I didn't say anything about how I felt from the conversation because I was afraid that it might come off as them not even trying at all. but I really was grateful for the company tho it didn't change how I felt about the smaller day to day things that made me feel left out. after the conversation, I just treated as if everything was sorted out and tried not to dwell on the smaller things. we did hang out more afterwards and had fun times together but there were times too when they talk about their group chat or when I look over and see their matching wallpapers and ultimately feel like I'll never be a part of them. sometimes it felt like everyone already had common knowledge but I'll presume that its because I wasn't in the group chat that I don't really know what's going on.. I know it's stupid to nitpick on these small things but it really does add up especially when everyone is living together.I thought to myself so many times about just ditching everything and move back home earlier or just go home for 1-2 weeks without telling anyone. I think the only reason why I didn't do that was because it was my last semester in hall and I wanted to cherish my stay. I did end up spending more time with my faculty friends tho and I'm happy to have them through all these, especially one whom I ranted to from the start of the semester. now that the sem has ended and I've moved out of hall, I feel more relieved that everything is no longer in-my-face. even though I wasn't added into their group til the end and I still feel sad when I happen see their group photo from that night on social media, it was nice of them to have told me that they hope to be able to hang out in the future. despite saying all of these, I still genuinely think that they are nice people. perhaps they just don't have the capacity to empathise with me or be more tactful in certain situations. there are many other details and incidents that I didn't include (cos rly >4 months worth???) but thanks for reading if you've made it this far!-#97744: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97744","['Care: 7 people', 'Like: 5 people', 'Haha: 2 people']",10 comments,2 shares
97739,"Hi all,I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Project Management and hope to get some insights on doing a dissertation. For my course, I have the option of doing a dissertation (after completing my 8 core modules) or replacing the dissertation with 2 electives. Pros of choosing elective - Finish my course earlier (don't have to complete the 8 core modules before doing my electives), Cons of choosing elective :-It will be quite packed in terms of study load. On top of that, I am juggling a full-time job. Pros of doing a dissertation:- Completing a dissertation can be useful if you wish to go into a particular sector which will value this research. Useful to put on my CV. Cons of doing a dissertation:- Need to be very passionate about my chosen topic. It will be quite useless since I am definitely not intending to pursue a PhD. I'm intending to help out in my family business permanently once I am done with my masters. I would love to hear about your views on doing/not doing a dissertation. Have anyone of you done one? How was it and how has it helped you in terms of your career?TIA! -#97739: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97739",['Like: 1 person'],0 Comments,0 Shares
97736,"What is your opinion on trading stocks as a full-time career? I have graduated with a PhD from NUS. However, I am not interested in pursuing a career in academia. Additionally, during my PhD, I gradually lost all interest in the field that I was in (I was in BioMed engineering). I told myself, I am never going to do a job that is related to my PhD or biomedical, and started to think about changing career. During my PhD, I found out that one thing that interests me is trading stocks. Hence, after I graduated with my PhD from NUS, I started exploring trading as a career, using a part of my saving as the capital to trade. Although I have a few years of experiences with investing in stocks, when it comes to trading for an income, the difficulty level was much much higher. During the first year or so, my income was negative and I kept on losing money. It was a painful process. Especially when I see my friends who did not do PhD and have a regular office job drawing a fixed amount of money, sometimes 4 figures, every month. But I learnt from my lessons and understand what causes me to lose money. Now, I have consistent profit and have covered back the initial losses. I know of a few people who earn 6 figures a month from trading and I am confident I will join them one day. From my experience in trading, it is a job where you can earn much higher than many other regular jobs if you can overcome the initial stage of losing money (and are left with sufficient capital to trade). Additionally, the working hours are flexible and short (some traders only trade 15 minutes a day). The list of benefits goes on. Despite these benefits, however, I find that there are not many full-time traders. I am curious as to why is this so. I hypothesise that many people see trading in a negative light. Is this true? Could you share with me what do you think of a trading career?-#97736: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97736","['Like: 21 people', 'Haha: 3 people']",27 comments,5 shares
97734,"Hi all, this is my first time doing a submission, and would like to seek some opinions anonymously. I do acknowledge that there is really no “one answer” to this. I’m currently seeing my boyfriend coming to around six months now. He is an awesome partner, basically almost everything you would hope a guy would have. He is genuine and caring, and I really like him a lot in that sense. However, I realised that I am not entirely attracted to him in the physical sense. And I think because of that, sometimes the sex may not be fulfilling to both of us. That has affected our relationship in some sense. I would just like to ask the masses about your opinions. I am slightly confused because I’ve heard both sides of the coin - I’ve had friends who advised me that it would probably not work out, but I’ve also had people tell me or cases where people stayed and it turned out well for them. So, yeah I would just like to hear your thoughts. I would just like say that I’m not trolling and I would really appeal to you all not to give comments like “you don’t deserve him” and all. I think this is really a legitimate issue I am facing, and I would just like to seek some opinions.-#97734: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97734","['Like: 5 people', 'Love: 1 person', 'Wow: 1 person']",16 comments,1 share
97733,"As someone who has degrees in CS and Engineering, let me compare the 2 for those deciding which degree to pursue:Why CS > Engineering: - Better prep (training, internships, networking) for software jobs, which are typically much better paid and more comfortable than traditional engineering jobs. This disparity is only going to widen. - More prestigious (recently anyway). Also, you get to surround yourself with smarter people, which, over 4 years, makes a difference in your development. - Easier and more interesting curriculum (Sit in a chem eng year 4 lecture and you'll know what I mean) - More fun. I know this one is subjective but many CS students actually code for pleasure, often applying techniques they picked up in class. How many chem engineers calculate turbulent flow in their free time? - More career flexibility/ options: can build a startup/ freelance as a dev quite easily, or move to Thailand to be a digital nomad, if you're into that kind of thing. Try freelancing as a mech engineer. - Better use of time: being IT-literate will help you tremendously in your personal life anyway, why not pursue it academically/ professionally? Maybe being a civil engineer will come in handy when doing your home reno or something. - CS gives you a worldview and tools for thinking that can generalize well across domains (divide and conquer, abstraction, algorithmic thinking, complexity, learning from data), whereas traditional engineering tends to teach you narrower, domain-specific frameworks.Why Engineering > CS:None, honestly. Can't think of any disadvantages of CS that don't also apply to other technically rigorous courses such as Engineering and Math, esp in the SG context.-#97733: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97733","['Like: 14 people', 'Haha: 6 people']",6 comments,2 shares
97732,"My two cents on the new covid measures.Prior to the restrictions, restaurants and gyms were the few exceptions where individuals could remove their mask in a public space. Hence, the restriction on dining-in and the use of gyms are meant to curtail any opportunity for people to congregate in mask-less settings. However, it seems that a glaring omission remains - smokers. They are allowed (or encouraged) to congregate at smoking points to smoke, mask-off. The limited size of smoking points generally mean that social distancing of mask-less smokers is limited, because smoking outside of the demarcated area may result in fines. Why are smokers allowed this exception to the rule, to go mask-less in public? Unless clear scientific evidence is available to show that the consumption of cigarettes reduces the risk of covid transmission, this glaring omission should be circumscribed immediately. It hardly bodes well for smokers to be given such a liberty, when the majority of individuals who are non-smokers have willingly sacrificed their own liberty for social interactions in the name of protecting those around us from the risk of covid transmission. Hence, smokers should not be allowed to light up in public while covid measures are in place. Smokers should be reminded that on the bright side, such a measure will help to correspondingly reduce the strain on health infrastructure in the future for diseases such as lung or throat cancer.-#97732: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97732","['Like: 19 people', 'Haha: 3 people']",0 Comments,1 comment
97730,"TL;DR, people should not behave with that holier than thou attitude over people who refuses to wear mask in public. Shouldn't dox others by digging out their past too.Since the start of this pandemic and the initiation of the requirement for everyone to wear a mask in public, there were some individuals who were caught markless in public. Some of these individuals even got aggressive towards the authorities and were rather stubborn over their beliefs regarding the donning of face mask in public.And of course, the reason why we were made known of such incidents were often due to someone else in public filming these people being caught in the act. Thereafter, these videos will be put up in a myriad of social media sites and may even be made into a meme for everyone to ridicule over.Yes, I do agree that such errant behaviour should not be condoned and the authorities should indeed take them to task. However, don't we find that the act of sensationalising these videos to be rather a rather low down behaviour too? Worse when there is some form of doxxing involved from digging up the past of these individuals and to make them a talking point over their behaviour.Just like the recent case of that lady who was caught maskless by the Safe Distancing Ambassadors and in turned questioned the authorities. Is it necessary to dig her past and go around plastering her days in the Navy? What's worse is when some commenters of these post went about equating her days in the Navy with her unruly behaviour. Our veterans are human being too and they are also entitled to their own opinions and beliefs. If it so happened that their behaviour is against the law, we should just let the authorities handle them. The act of judging an individual based on their past will achieve nothing but make you not much better as a person too.To think about it, these people who went about doxxing others are not much of a saint either. To these people, are you confident to tell the world that you are indeed following the rules strictly and is straight as an arrow? I don't think so. Nobody is perfect.I had often seen lots of people wearing their mask like chin straps or to wear one and to not cover their nose in public either. So I don't think anybody should go about sensationalising such cases of individuals who breached the mask wearing rule.-#97730: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97730","['Like: 10 people', 'Haha: 2 people']",3 comments,1 share
97728,"The view from a hospital pharmacy counterMy recent encounter with Mr LSF whose transplanted kidney, has started to fail again after 20 years, left me thinking. Of the sense of loss. Not long ago, perhaps five, six years back, this jolly sixty- plus- year- old man, became a regular at our pharmacy. For reasons unclear, he tended to linger at my counter, chit-chatting me up. To be frank, having to give out medications to so many people a day, I usually remember the medications they have more than the people they are. But this man lingered on so long, for so numerous the occasions, sharing his kidney transplant story, how proud he was to maintain his fitness regime, recommending me the brands of toothpaste on the pharmacy floor, I was not sure whether to feel flattered because it was me, he targeted those conversations on, or irritable (common sir, these are too long-winded to be exchanges between strangers on the train, or on the hospital pharmacy counter, for that matter. And there are the next patients behind, always …)His manners were impeccable, his good intention often shone through, so there were no reasons to be rude. I, though feeling slightly unease, politely listened through his lengthy convos on mundane matters like his love for crab cuisine, his recent cruise to somewhere etc, while trying to think of ways to direct his attention to the fuming red patients standing behind him. (They looked as if I were committing an indecency by lending an ear to him. They were longing for me to stop)Fast forward to today, I saw his script, his name on it, but instead of him, his wife and son came forward  collecting his medications. His condition must have taken a turn for a worse, to have BOTH the son and the wife accompanying this visit. True enough, the notes said his transplanted kidney was failing, he was back to peritoneal dialysis and was going to be admitted for a myriad of infections. It brought me back to that amorphous feeling, an uncategorized sense of loss, of the grief that is to come. Not a personal loss as he and I were not related, but dismal enough to put me in a melancholic mood for the day because he was a familiar face.How many more years, months he has, I wonder?After the death of another patient, a year ago, I had for some time experience a most vivid feeling of loss, a spot of bother that lasted surprisingly longer that I had expected. Mrs C was a perennial fixture in the pharmacy, for she came by every 2 months, an amputee in wheelchairs, to collect her bags and bags of medications and dressings, and morphine tablets and bottles of morphine syrups - the highlight of her every visit.She belonged to the categories of anxious people, who existed before immaterial time, had somehow got hold of my supervisor’s number and requested for her medicine to be prepared before arrival. This process was neither right nor was it our standard procedure, but her suffering must have felt so immense, and her irritation so palpable, we all scuttled to do her biddings every time she came. Definitely not out of fear, perhaps out of pity, I think? More certainly, it was perhaps because she was a regular - one that we thought belonged to the vampire caste, feasted on the opioid craze and would last forever till eternity.   After some time, I didn’t know why but she preferred me (apart from my soft-hearted boss, that one was definitely her favourite) to dispense medications to her. She usually asked me how I was, if have I eaten etc, questions that I classified under diatribes that didn’t merit a counter enquiry and proper response. I, again, usually just listened and nodded, out of politeness (and at any rate, I was exhausted with the crowd, making small talks was never my forte).The last time we talked she commented on how exhausted I looked. I chuckled as usual, and went on to explain about the change in the morphine syrup formulation we were giving her that day. Two weeks later, I heard news of her passing… A life extinguished.For me, it must be a very terrible thing, to see so much and to feel so deeply.Amid all the merry-making, pleasure-seeking, asset-accumulating life processes, when you are engrossed, so engrossed that you have no sense of proportion, no sense of awareness - of your cosmic unimportance, a life unfolding before your eyes suddenly interrupted, a door slammed in your face, a bold reminder “So this is what life’s really like. Deceive yourself no longer.

For those that are asking me to complete my education, I am currently studying for my degree while my bf is working in a job where he does not see himself working in that industry for the next 5 years, and did not like the course he took in poly. So in terms of finance, it's a bit on the rocky side. I need some advice on what do you consider as a good husband, or some green flags in a relationship.

97713,"My friend seems to be strung along by a guy she had a crush on since long ago. They have been together for about half a year and she was the one who asked him out,the situation sounds real similar to a post made earlier on .The guy in question never seemed to have plans for their future and always finds some sort of excuse to divert the question whenever long term commitment is being talked about.They would get into fights due to this, but the guy would always manage to sweet talk her back. He would not treat her very nicely, but would always seem to have changed for the better, only to revert back to a heck care attitude once things have stabled down again .My friend probably has a gut feeling that he is not serious about her and would frequently question herself and feel alone and burnt out from trying to maintain the relationship. Having trust issues, not seeing the result she wants But after everything, she seem to feel that he loves her , how he connects well with her etc and she would be giving him gifts and so on to keep him around. She had spent thousands on this particular guy over a span of around half a year. As an outsider, it is very obvious that she is being strung around and getting used. I have met the guy in question, and he gives off the feeling that he just wants to enjoy the moment but not have long term commitments. He is quite well spoken and seem to know how to sweet talk/ small talk , he works in a job that requires him to be able to teach or talk to people. I suppose he needs to keep up his looks and talk well for his ricebowl and my friend just got smitten. Our clique and even her parents confronted her about this, trying to help her see the truth that he is exploiting her affections for his own gains ,but she would find excuses to justify everything.Excuses that are borderline crazyTo the point where she had a fight with her parents and shut out everybody who tried to help. She had lost many friends, quit hobbies and fully became a housefly that flies around that guy.Is there anyway to wake her up from her daydream and see the truth?It sucks to see her suffer everytime those fights happen and she pretty much compromises and do things to make the guy stay and the guy just needs to put up an act and accept the ""apology"".

97709,"Can anyone advice me what to do when my bf is too kind to his friends and too easily convinced!!! So recently he lend money to his friend without me knowing. I mean it's his money I can't control who he lend to right. But it actually hurts me so much because the fact that he hide it from me. The reason I'm so frustrated is because that friend of his is not even his close friends??? And is someone I have never heard of, after all these years together with him. His reason of hiding - Scared I will nag at him for lending his friend money. His friend is a female and I think he is afraid I will be jealous. I have my fair share to be jealous tbh. He never even spend that much on me before and yet he lend this money to his friend without much thought??? It's not like as if he is super rich or what, all this is his hard earned money. I understand that his friend is in a bad financial situation, and he really lend out of good will. But why make it so shady by hiding from me? I emphasized so much in this relationship that I want everything to be transparent. This is not the first time he ""choose not to tell me"" cause he don't want me to nag or scared I will be jealous. HELLO but when I found out the truth, it just hurts so much. I'm not willing to let go of this relationship because it's not like as if there's a third party's involvement. But I'm not sure how should I approach this if something similar happened again. To me it is a deal breaker, because very often hiding leads to lying, and lying will eventually leads to deceiving. I do not want our relationship to be toxic by constantly paranoid over him lying to me. I trust him so much but right now my trust to him is never the same again.

We have been together for about 7 months and we met through tinder. He is to me perfect and always give in to me whatever the circumstances is. In fact i feel guilty being with him as he has always treat me with so much love while on the other hand, i always show him attitude. However to be honest, in the first place, we are 2 very different people leading different life. Firstly, I'm a Christian while he is not. I tried to ask him to attend church service with me over the weekend when he book out but he has never been interested to attend. Only once did he attend and that was only because i was going to be at church the whole day.Secondly, i'm in NUS while he doesn't have any uni placing at the moment as he did not do too well in poly. Till now, he still doesn't know what he wants to do in future and that worries me.Also, i feel like we don't get to spend much time together. Throughout this 7 months, i'm only able to see him only during the weekends. Sometimes we get to spend the whole weekend together and at times we spent only a few hours together. I really love him but it just sucks so much to wait for 1 whole week just to spend so little time and every time he books in, the same whole cycle repeats itself. its really frustrating. Sometimes when he is free, he will ask to go out with his friends or army mates. I feel like we are already spending so little time together as a couple, why does he still want to meet them just to drink or whatever. Furthermore, idk why is he always feeling tired. It's like he gets to sleep in camp after training but whenever he books out, he still complains that he is tired.While i really love my bf, i really dk is he the one for me given that even at this relatively early stage, we already have so much differences. After speaking to my parents, they advised me not to date during this period while im studying as he will be  a distraction. To add on, i recently met this guy who is my senior in NUS and is about to graduate with good grades.

I am kind of a reserved guy (but kinda talkative when we're close), so when I picked up the courage to confess to my girlfriend >5 years ago, I was shocked that she agreed to be an item. Fast-forward to the present, we're comfortable with each other. We leave time for each other, talk to each other on a daily basis, celebrate occasions etc. We've always talked about settling down in the future (about marrying and getting a house, children), and now that it creeps ever so slowly closer, I have been having dreams about not committing. What I mean by not committing is not cheating. I have never been in serious contact with another girl ever since we got together, just during projects and stuff. My girlfriend and I have pretty different personalities and ideologies. She is less structured in life and likes social media drama, gossip etc. I do still listen to her and try to understand what's going on but they are not my interests. My interests are in world affairs (ethics, politics), or like hypothetical made up situations (idk one random example would be like the ethics of a panopticon, and understanding other's perspectives, one of the reasons why I like to read books). We do talk about my interests sometimes, but not at the depth I'd like. You can say that they are just dreams, but they have been coming over and over, over a period of a few months and its seriously bringing me closer to a mental breakdown. These dreams are me with another girl (the girl changes in these dreams. Sometimes its a primary school friend, sometimes its a secondary school friend. Both of whom I have not kept in contact with.) The dreams are nothing fancy, but rather just me just chatting with them. But whenever I wake up, I start to doubt my relationship. I cherish this relationship. We've been through ups and downs, but if I were to marry her and get bored of each other due to the differences being too much, I'd honestly stop wasting her time. I'd rather be alone than keep her in this relationship.-#97697: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97697","['Like: 23 people', 'Sad: 8 people', 'Wow: 3 people']",25 comments,6 shares
97696,"There is always someone who go down the slippery slope of “biological differences” to justify unequal gender obligations. In any case, barring elite military branches such as commandos, most girls of average physique should be able to serve reasonably well. You don’t need superhuman strength to hold a rifle and shoot someone. Ask Israel etc., they tried and its possible. (and the reason why females are not put in combat roles are NOT due to “genetics”)If you argue based on “biological differences”, that the natural sexual dimorphism has significant bearing on suitability to do certain jobs (in this case, NS vocations as “jobs”), justifying why women should not go into armed forces, then do you realise what it also means? It is well known scientifically that sexual dimorphism does not stop at physique. Male and females’ brains are different too. In terms of behaviour, sexual dimorphism exists also. If “biological differences” are that pronounced that we could excuse females from NS, does not mean that there are well paid prestigious male dominated careers that females are simply “genetically unsuitable” (based on the same slippery slope logic)?How coincidental that “biological differences” only applies to things that females dislike? And when they dislike NS for reasons such as “its too tough”, does that not reinforce the societal expectations of women, the same thing that feminists are so eager to abolish in areas that suit them? It’s hypocritical to hide behind “biological differences” to escape from obligations that no one likes, but at the same time, denouncing it when justifying for minority quota or other privileges to access beneficial career opportunities.-#97696: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97696","['Like: 14 people', 'Haha: 2 people', 'Wow: 2 people']",5 comments,2 shares

97685,"Hello readers I just need some advice. I’ve been told that my requirements for a partner is a bit too high by my colleagues and that I must lower my standards:1) must be able to accept that I want my career to be priority2) either be able to cook or do house maintenance since I can do both 3) be willing to split parenting a child if we want any so that the managing of schedules won’t be on one person / they handle the kid, I handle the cooking and house maintenance (or vice versa)4) accept that I am financially independent and don’t need to rely on them for allowance. I also drive and am willing to ferry them to their doorstep while dating5) that I have platonic friends of the opposite gender who I am close to6) be okay with me wanting to pursue a phd eventually while workingAre those standards too high and make me undesirable?

97683,"Coming to the issue of girls serving NS, I would like to share my thoughts on this.Firstly people might argue that girls are biologically different and might not be able to handle the physical hardships in the tough environment. No doubt this may be true to certain extent, but I will say that it only holds for some girls. Why do I say that? Reason being, there are girls out there who are fit enough to lift weights, so carrying a weapon might not be of any difficulty to them, not even running since there are many fitspo gals out there who can run as fast as guys. (East Coast Park etc) These are in fact the girls who should join the combat unit.Another reason is that the girls in our generation are growing taller beyond 170cm. Before I get flamed on this, allow me to point out that being tall has always been a symbol of masculinity for guys. Since there is this gender equality thing, it should hold for the tall ladies as well who can be perceived as strong Amazons, doing their part to contribute to the nation.(The reason why I claim this is I myself is 170cm tall as well and I do observe my surroudings and there are many girls at my eye level so they should be around this height.) Instead of eat drink and making merry in shopping centres or restaurants, they should do their part to help guys out in NS and not waste the vertical space on this small tiny dot.Coupled with the fact that we are facing an ageing population with large no. of boomers, we need even more manpower to boost our defence capabilities especially from the younger generation where tall ladies can play their part.Some xenophobic people may ask why not the foreigners serve NS? Well the reason is simple. Your own country you protect yourself. They have already done their part to boost the economy, otherwise we wouldnt have the luxury of enjoying today.So it is not just guys who should serve, it should in fact be made mandatory for tall or fit girls to serve as well to prove their worth. Short girls are excused. Sorry.-#97683: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97683","['Like: 19 people', 'Haha: 18 people']",29 comments,5 shares

97681,"Hi! I’m 18F, dating 21M. Writing this confession because I am seriously frustrated with how little attention my boyfriend actually gives me. I’m taking As this year and my boyfriend is waiting to start uni. We meet once every week, it may seem like a lot but it’s usually very late into the night like 9pm/10pm and we just have sex or something sexual. He always says that he actually planned something, but never got to execute it because “hormones got in the way”. I was fine with it, let’s just take it that it was just a more physical form of communication or in the heat if the moment. But, it started happening consistently, every week rinse and repeat. Even if I had more time to spare for him, he never brought me on nice dates ever since the first time we engaged in something sexual. I would think that at the very least, we could talk a bit more on text.   He just texts me when he feels like it and leaves me hanging whenever one of his friends texts him. There was this one time he was even on a call with one of his girl friends for over an hour, comforting her when he knows that that girl is into him. Where’s that effort or energy for me?If you have so much time to spare for your friends, why can’t you share a little bit more with me?

97671,"TLDR: Busy gf, bf doesn't seem to understand, how?My bf and I have very different educational background, he currently doesn't have a job and is still in search of one, while I've been working for a while already, in an agency. :"") If you're in the marketing/advertising/media industry you'll understand how tiring it is and how work-life balance is really difficult to manage when you work in agencies. On top of my day job, I have my own side-hustle, and on top of that, I'm constantly upgrading myself by signing up for courses, which means any time I get out of my usual working hours (I OT quite a bit) is used up. I try my best to accommodate to him and meet him as often as I can, I still meet him 2-3 times a week, at least for dinner, or stay over at his place, but it's really tiring for me, because to me, his home is not my home, his bed is not my bed, and it makes a difference. I don't even have much time to spend on my own, relaxing and doing things I enjoy, and yet if I choose to not spend an extra day with him, he gets upset and tries to think of ways to get me to meet him or stay over. I'm working hard because this career path is something I really wanted, I still have a huge uni debt to pay off, and my pay isn't enough to help me pay it off quickly, so I do freelance on the side to finance my loans as well, I take on courses because I believe they will help me gain an advantage when my bosses consider employees for a promotion, or maybe these skills and knowledge can help me get a higher pay.  Sometimes I just wish to have one entire week to myself to rest but when I bring it up, my bf gets upset. I have my own family, we're not married yet but he doesn't seem to understand that my family will get upset if I keep spending so much time away. I have no idea how to tell him this nicely and get him to understand, we've fought over this multiple times but every single time, because I don't dare and don't know how to put it across, I end up giving in and squeezing time out for him again, sacrificing my rest and all. I go home late on weekdays just because he wants to spend more time together, and then I end up having to take a cab to work the next day because I didn't get enough sleep and I can't wake up in time. Aside from this, he is a very caring and loving bf, he takes care of me, is super loyal and devoted, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, only plays games with me, doesn't look at girls, don't follow female influencers, he is like the nicest guy ever, just that he's super clingy and just can't seem to be away from me.

Actually I always wanted to keep myself busy because I have no partner to spend my time with, friends, I started to feel distanced away. So. yes I met someone I valued as important, but he doesnt really value much of my existence. He never initiated much outing with him, but days when I am busy, I felt guilty not having the time for him, or put in it another way, I want to see him although I am busy and tired. I truly understand how it feel and what people meant when they say no matter how busy a person can be, he/she will still make time for the important one. So, I actually didnt know what I need to do. I had too much of a ""down"" with him , but as he being an important one, even if there is one ""up"" moment, it seem to fade all the ""down"" moment. I am not important to him, so each time when we have good times together ( I enjoyed myself always), I often ask myself, is this our end. Should I end this ""relationship"" with him. Am I already satisfied with some ""memories"" with him? Each time I asked myself, maybe, maybe I can stop thinking of ending and just enjoy every little moment. But being an emotional person, I dont think I can stop thinking, when will this feeling of ""up and down"" end, because it is very exhausting. And so, I am really busy with work lately, although works had really started to drain me, and start to fade my smile, my cheerful self, it can make me move on from him, unknowningly.

They left their previous jobs of course on the obvious reasons such as: Don't like the jobs, don't like the team, don't like the company. Rather than being so curious on why they resigned, why not focus more on what qualities the candidates actually posses? Does that mean just because candidate doesn't like his previous work, this time round he will not work as hard for the new company? Or does that mean that if he don't like his previous company, he will not strive in the new company? Or do you want candidate to actually package it in a nice way, to make those resignation reasons sound more positive? Such as, looking for better opportunities blah blah blah. All this is BS because who doesn't want to look for better opportunity.

97656,"When I first entered uni, I became fast friends with a girl in my course since we attended orientation together. We were both attached back then and our partners are in other unis. This girl and I have the same group of friends, so no surprise we hang out with each other a lot. My then girlfriend felt suspicious that I was always texting her and going out with my uni friends when I’ve always been someone who rather stay at home. It was then I realised that I developed feelings for my friend. On her part, she was constantly breaking up and getting back together with her boyfriend, and often relied on me for support during these hard times. Eventually, her boyfriend became aware of me and maybe at some point of time, I could have been the reason for their on and off relationship. I distanced myself from her which resulted in a lot of conflict between us, but I was determined to make things work between my then girlfriend and I. Ultimately, the hurt I caused my then girlfriend was too much and she ended things with me after 4 years together. The guilt I felt towards my then girlfriend was overwhelming, I would cry every time I think about what I put her through. It took me about 2 years before I could stop hating myself. Throughout these 2 years, as I was single, I managed to mend my friendship with this girl. While I continued to provide her with support when she needs me, I also reminded myself that she is still attached. We mostly meet to attend classes, eat meals, or study together. We hang out outside of uni probably once a month at best. There were times where this girl tells me to go and date, but honestly, I fear that I would put through another girl the same pain I put my ex through. It took me so long to be comfortable enough to share my mistake without breaking down, and to be honest, I don’t actually think I forgive myself. Anyway, last year, this girl broke up with her boyfriend for good. The dynamic between us never changed until recently, where we started hanging out outside of uni on a weekly basis. A part of me feels that I don’t want to give up on her after all the shit we’ve been through, hence why I stayed by her side all these while. Maybe all these while, I’ve been waiting for her, but I deny that to myself. But there were times where I look at her and I feel that we are not compatible and it’s impossible for us to be together. I’m not entirely sure. Though I’ve never said it explicitly, I’m sure she’s well aware that I am interested in her. I have asked her before if she was looking to date, months after breaking up. She replied that she would like to stay single because she’s not ready for a relationship. My friends say that she’s only making use of me for the attention because if she really likes me, she would have left her ex boyfriend long ago for me. On top of that, they say that that’s a common excuse given to hint that girls give when they are not interested. So now I’m second guessing the reason for her meeting me every week. Could it be because she’s single now and seek validation, or perhaps she’s interested in me? I honestly don’t know what to do with this entire situation. It’s been years and I feel like I never got to see the end of it.-#97656: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97656","['Like: 3 people', 'Wow: 1 person']",0 Comments,10 comments

I have a stronger mentality than before, not having much of an in depth care about the world but mainly myself and my family. With him. we are still following each other on some social platforms and probably keeping track of each other’s social posts daily but we do not talk or interact at all. Despite what had happened before, a part of me still thinks it was quite a shame for what seemed like a happy and chill conversation with a “friend” can disappear in a day. I tried to hate him, for his actions hurt me a lot but then I couldn’t. I still thought the best of him. I preached about wanting to just stay single and that I am not suited for a relationship which in turn saw me turning down a few guys and escaping from situations when the other party tries to go deep or take things up a notch. There’s still so much I want to know about him and for him to find out about me but at the same time doubting what could possibly happen or re-live the same ghosting incident. I guess it's better to lie low, reminiscing silently and hope to forget him than to chat him up only to waste each other’s' time and risk getting hurt again. Right?

This may sound like a stupid idea to most, but the idea of military service and protecting one's country has always appealed to me, and I would be willing to undergo all the xiong training just to reach my end goal. If any ex-regulars (doesn't matter which org.) can give some insight into post-service employment especially in the government sector, would be great. Option B: Try (and potentially fail) to get MFA midterm scholarship while in uni, which will inevitably secure me a bond with MFA post graduation. This might seem like the obvious choice, but what is the career progression like for this option, compared to the first? Also, is Option A a viable (and the best) way to go in the case Option B fails?Apologies for the long read, and I know it's a stupid dream, but it's my dream.-#97645: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97645","['Like: 8 people', 'Love: 1 person', 'Care: 1 person']",0 Comments,8 comments

For guys, it would be not to respect their girlfriend and not report to her. Is it a relic from toxic masculinity? Complaining is a sign of a weakness and sucking it up is the only way to go.

97638,"Is it because we are female, that we are meant to be stared at? I don't dress provocatively, I sometimes where a nice knee-length/full-length dress but the men still stare. Is it because we are female, that we are supposed to get use to male colleagues ""casually"" touching our hands and shoulders? I already try to stay away from these colleagues, try to keep with a group of females so I don't get targeted, but still sometimes the situation means I have to interact with them. Is it because we are female, that we are supposed to fit into clothing and shoes that don't make sense, and have to learn to make do? Like high heels (I have to nurse my feet after), or bareback dresses (then I have to make do with nubra), or sleeveless dresses (I have to make do with the cold environment).I work in the events line, and I have somehow quietly accepted that at events, women are meant to ""look nice/presentable"", unlike men who can wear anything and get away with it. Heck, if I even forget to put on lipstick, people will say I look pale or unpresentable. And then there is the nice hair, nice dress, nice shoes, nice makeup - cannot have any one of these elements missing, or it will be deemed unacceptable.-#97638: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97638","['Like: 34 people', 'Care: 10 people', 'Haha: 6 people']",45 comments,8 shares
97637,"Prof Ben/any people willing to share their advance:I just graduated from poly and currently waiting for my NS. Meanwhile I am thinking whether I should go uni......Would you recommend me to go to uni if i alr  know what i want to work as? Like super sure cause I have been through 2 same internships during diff period of the year and always get advance from the bosses/seniors of the company. And also currently joining their club (they have a student club for students to join to make new friends and also deepen their knowledge related to job scopes of the company). The job that I really want is more of my skills, experience and portfolio, I would say a poly cert/degree related to that field is a plus to it. Side note: my diploma is 100% not related to what I want to work as, it is actually the club, internships and the networking that I have connected over the years that makes me really want to pursue a career in that field. I am able to “feel and find myself” in that career. The degree that is related to the career that I want only covers less than 30% of the actual job scope. If I am really planing to study uni, I will most probably choose something that is not related to the job that I want (cause to study for the sake of doing it + my poly gpa is not so good)I mean I am willing to take a diploma pay but at least I am exploring more on the field and also improving my skills/ what I want in life for 4 years Reason why my parents want me to go:1) they never go before uni, they 16 years old alr stop schooling, around sec4 thus they don’t want me to end up like them - meaning - starting with a lower salary + ppl will take advantage of you cause you only have poly cert.2) they look up to my relatives cause they all go uni but the thing is that they went to jc so need to go uni.-#97637: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97637","['Like: 3 people', 'Sad: 1 person']",7 comments,1 share
97636,"Hi Admins pls dont filter this out, just felt like reflecting on some stuff. For some reason when me and my ex broke up i didnt grief as much as i did in a previous relationship, and thinking about it i felt it may be because i know i deserve alot more than what she had to afford, which were just bare minimum or sometimes even not. She was broken when she entered the rs and i tried my best to help her and ""fix"" her but in the process had also lost myself. She doesnt rly make me feel loved, i receive the most dry ""gd morning"" text from her, it doesnt seem like she is excited to spend time with me too and never once gave me any reassurance, especially since she hangs out with alot of guys and even go out 1 on 1 afew times, and im not talking about sweet text(which NEVER happened ONCE throughout the time we dated). She also wears shirts that belongs to other guys which i personally feel is unacceptable( i wld understand if it was a new shirt given as a gift). She's lowkey a gold digger also because i realise i always end up spending at least half of whatever money i have each month on her. And while im taking time to heal now she's going ard seeking affirmation from other guys trying to fill the void i left which is kind of toxic in my opinion. That doesnt bother me though because her next relationship wont end up lasting seeing how she treats the whole situation and she'll probably end up continuously filling that void till she finally wakes up and realise her own mistakes. At least i get to laugh at her glow down while i have my glow up and watch my bank account grow and eventually find someone else to give the world to and spend my money on. And if she sees this i hope she'll realise that it is her loss because someone who she once complained about being poor is now 10 times richer and she lost someone that would do anything for her while all i lost was someone who couldnt give me the simplest words of affirmation.

97624,"Should people who have spent too long in the SAF be considered good candidates to be leaders of private sector corporations?I spent quite some time in two highly profitable American corporations, where the spirit of constructive defiance of authority has been prized. Company executives have developed a culture of asking for opinions from the most junior employees in a meeting, so that fresh ideas can be thrown out and debated on in a sort of safe space. Project managers are also given ample room to test out their own solutions. Even though they risk being fired if they do a bad job of it, if their solutions work, they are rewarded handsomely. Here's the thing, even though the leaders know of the risk that project managers will do a bad job, for the most part, they create an environment that ensure merit, true merit, gets discovered. The SAF has a way of doing things, but the way the SAF does things is almost completely contrary to how a profitable corporation should do things. I have heard ex-SAF generals being lauded by party leaders for having led organizations of many people, which makes them qualified to lead large organizations in any industry. But it does not constitute a skill to be put in a position where your followers are 100% obligate followers. In addition, SAF is an organization that does not have to be profitable. Thus, very few things are mission critical. When the chief does something wrong, especially in a country like Singapore, the consequences are far less severe compared to when the CEO of Intel makes a wrong move. That's why it is dangerous for such corporations to give too rely too much on the discretion of their decision-makers, and strongman decision-makers are rarely preferred.I move to keep anyone who has ever been a regular in the SAF out of any for-profit organizations entirely. We have seen what these people can do to NOL, SMRT, I honestly don't want to see it happening to SIA, SingTel, or DBS.-#97624: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97624","['Like: 72 people', 'Haha: 12 people']",14 comments,11 shares
97623,"Guy A and Girl B have been dating for 2 years. Recently, Guy A told Girl B that he feels that she is being self-absorbed and does not take care of him. Example he gave: he was busy with work and was sick (not infectious kind) but he still went ahead to meet up with his friends (for his dog’s socialization gathering). Yet he told her he didn’t have time to meet her. Girl B was upset about it and threw a fuss. In the past, Guy A would comfort her and make things better but now Guy A said he’s tired and does not want to have to deal with her emotional outburst. Guy A used to call every day after work if they can’t meet. But recently, Guy A stopped doing it after he said he feels she is self absorbed.Guy A accompanies Girl B for medical appointments, help her with her work woes, give advice on family drama (would stay up till 4am to hear her out if she has any issues), cooks for her or sends her food (but not every day - like once in awhile). But Girl B feels that he should be doing these things anyways and it’s his responsibility as a boyfriend so i he’s actually going above and beyond to be a good boyfriend. These are baseline expectations. He said that this shows her self-entitled mentality and he’s not sure of a future because (1) self-absorbed, (2) self-entitled, and (3) he wants to feel taken care of as well. Girl B disagrees that she is self-absorbed or self-entitled though she acknowledges that she may not be very good at taking care of him.He said that women are into equality these days (similar to what a previous poster wrote) yet women don’t step up and look after the guys. Instead, they want to be pampered (nothing wrong with that) just that they need to not be double standards about it. I read somewhere about how you want your guy to treat you like a queen, you have to treat him like a king too.Question: how do you girls look after your guys?

97621,"Admin….hope you can don’t filter this…..because I need some answers.TLDR: I just don’t understand how I always seem to piss my guy friends off. And it always happen with the ones whom I’m closer with. Like for Guy A, we gotten really close; close as in will chat ABIT(maybe 10 msgs) almost everyday, will meet in GROUPS(got girls/guys) every week or every fortnight. But we almost never meet alone because I had promised my SO that I will try to avoid meeting guy friends alone in order to avoid misunderstandings. I’m happily married and everyone knows that. With my guy friends, we are also always prim and proper – no touchy touchy, no hold hands, don’t lean on each other, basically no skin-ship. After meet-ups, I also go home myself instead of letting them fetch me home. I always pay my own share too. I also call them by proper names, not “bii”, not “dear” and definitely nothing like “miss you” that sorta msgs. Guy A tends to ask me where I’m going on weekends and I usually don’t hide anyway. And gradually it became a habit for him to ask me where I’m going, doing what and meeting who. As we are good friends, I will just answer, for e.g, I will say I’m meeting my colleagues to drink, etc. Sometimes, when some messages are just before bed time, generally we will “good night” each other. Once, I didn’t reply his question on whether I’ve reached home after drinks, the next day he threw tantrum at me. I was shocked but I explained nicely I’m merely too tired. Things were back to normal but slowly, it became a daily routine which I grew abit tired of. So 1 day I told him why it’s like I’m reporting to him and I told him I’m not a kid. I was finally fed up and told him I’m just going to stop the daily “reached home” and “good night” reporting. Then he broke down and cried, saying he’s just worried about me as they are guys around who drinks. I felt bad and apologized… Sigh….then somehow more and more things popped up where he will get angry with me. I’m the kind who “eat soft don’t eat hard”, so whenever he’s fierce with me, I will argue back. But whenever when I’m too harsh then he will…be sad and affected. I will again get soft-hearted and pacify him again. It’s such a vicious cycle that I’m getting crazy.Then there is Guy B whom I’m also close with; our closeness is quite the same as Guy A – meet in groups quite frequently, hardly meet alone, prim and proper, but we hardly chat with messages. But the difference he has with Guy A is he has very strong pride. Which means our arguments can get very heated. But I really don’t understand why does he gets angry with me so easily either? There was once where I bailed out of a group meet up because I was too tired, he got angry with me. I’m so sure if it’s the other guys, he will definitely not mind at all because it happened before. He threw a fit by messaging me a few whatsapp pages until I had to make a trip down. There was another time where he also threw tantrum at me by scolding me via whatsapp continuously for an hr just because I sided with another guy friend in a game of cards. Sometimes I see other girls drop mild sarcastic jokes in jest, he can laugh and refute back but if it’s me, it’s as if volcano erupts. What the hell man…..Everytime we quarrelled about these minor stupid stuffs(everytime is him getting angry), sometimes he apologized, sometimes he doesn’t. THEN, it became so bizarre that he tried various ways to get me angry or hurt me by hurling really mean and condescending remarks infront of all our friends. I have generally a good temper(or rather, I’m just very bo-chup) but even so, I’m getting kind of exasperated through time! It's getting kinda ridiculous when he started to say things he don't mean, like ""I don't wanna see you!"" but still continues to ask me out. Sometimes I really dont know what he wants. I don’t really apologize to Guy B since he’s always malicious while scolding me, unlike Guy A who somehow explained his actions are for my own good and that I’ve hurt him etc. Since I've typed so much, then might as well! There’s also something which I don’t understand. There’s a Guy C whom suddenly out of nowhere said “You don’t matter to me at all” in a flat, normal tone kinda voice when he was intoxicated. I was stunned, said nothing but I was thinking like “What?!”. I’m thinking he must be drunk so I also didn’t say anything much. But it happened again on another group outing where he said again “You are not important to me at all”. Seriously??!! ,=)’’’ It’s so bizarre as I thought we have always been okay friends and he is usually very nice. Oh Common…. I know I’m not important nor matter to him but really necessary to say right to my face meh……it’s so embarrassing, and kinda hurting too.Why I have a feeling Guy B and Guy C just want to make me feel bad when I didn't really offend them at all........So what’s wrong? Anything wrong with me? Like why all this kept happening? I’ve consulted my female friends before and most of them generally asked me to give up the friendship to spare myself of all the frustration – there is that, but I just wish to know where’s the problem, else it’s going to happen again whenever I get close to a guy friend. To me, guy friends and girl friends are both equally important and the same to me. Is there any way to stop all this? How to…make guys stop…how to say….. – they seemed to take my words/opinions/presence abit too seriously or I will just somehow unknowingly piss them off whatsoever. Geez….I have so much phobia now until I dare not talk too much to other guy friends in case we get too close and such things happen again. I’m usually a happy-go-lucky and sunshine kinda girl. -#97621: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97621","['Like: 12 people', 'Haha: 10 people', 'Care: 4 people']",36 comments,1 share

97617,"My bf and I have been tgt for close to a year now. Both of us are working shifts so it’s quite flexible to meet up a few times in a week. I do see a future with him but there’s some issues that’s bothering me and I’m not sure if this would pose a problem in the future. I’m a person that has my phone with or beside me all the time n would reply almost immediately. One thing that bothers me is that whenever he has free time n we are chatting, suddenly out of nowhere he would just disappear. And the next thing I see is he’s online on FB. For the next few mins there will be no replies, then finally some messages n gone again. Whereas for me if I’m on phone or doing some other things, if his messages come I’ll immediately open. Is this a matter of prioritising or idk how to put it. I understand that during work there will be busy times, but when you’re finally free or have breaks, don’t u wna squeeze in abit to text your SO n chat abit? This happened many times n often I tell myself to just close one eye n do my stuffs, if he replies then so be it. Another thing is his family. His family is generally quite nice to me, never felt so welcoming before. The issue is about money, where they would sometimes borrow from him and till date none is returned back. Y’all may think like since it’s family, don’t have to be so calculative. Small amounts maybe forget it, but imagine lump sum like 4 digits? It’s his hard earned bonus money, and gone like a snap. I don’t see a chance of it being returned altho they promised to because it’s such a large amount. He don’t earn a lot also, and still gives allowance, leaving a tiny bit to the savings. Im not sure if this will be an issue in the future because money is impt and we have to think about housing.

97615,"To the OP of #97608, I feel that communication might be an issue between you and your girlfriend. My girlfriend of 3 years is quite similar to your girlfriend too, but to be honest neither do I see myself being replaced by a dog, nor thinking that she is being overly nice to her dog. She used to have a Labrador, but after it passed, she is now having a corgi too, and since it’s small, she can easily bring her everywhere, and this is where my concern comes in.I believe everyone views things differently. Some people may think that feeding your dog with average meal, bath your dog regularly, walk your dog on a daily basis, all these are sufficient to be a good dog owner, but some people take this to the next level by treating their dogs with kibbles, pricey food, baby pram, dog clothes, monthly grooming, which really incur shitload more money. Basically the OP has nothing against his girlfriend’s dog, but rather has concern on her spending that makes it difficult for them to settle down by buying house, getting married, etc.Frankly speaking I feel that bringing your dog out to nice places once in a while is fine, which is what my girlfriend does as well, but if she does it so often, together with the large amount of money incurred that actually affect your relationship, then you should really talk to your girlfriend about it. My girlfriend used to be like yours, she brought our corgi everywhere, literally EVERYWHERE including hawker, marketplace, etc. I actually felt that she has overdone and misunderstood the meaning of love for your pet, so I told her about it and elaborated whatever that bothers me. Like sometimes I find it quite burdensome to bring him out because 1. We had to keep watching him to prevent him from acting aggressively out of a sudden or running away from us, 2. We had to find a pet-friendly or outdoor non-air-conditioned places to dine in, 3. Due to the fact that we can’t bring pets into shopping malls, our outings became café hopping, beach walking, sightseeing, and I could no longer enjoy walking in malls, 4. People beside our table tend to be more aware and away from us due to the fur. At some food courts, we’ve been confronted several times by people beside our table, telling us that our dog fur flew to their table. Some elderlies even yelled at us for dirtying the seat because we let our dog sit on the chair. I’ve also seen people requested to change table so that they can stay further away from us. I knew these are the consequences that I will faced, so I always tried to put a smile on my face and just apologized to them. However, I knew this really should stop, because relationship is about 2 parties, and it doesn’t make sense to me if my girlfriend enjoys frequently brings our dog out but I feel the burden and totally didn’t enjoy the outings at all. I eventually talked to her about it and we had several big fights, but now she understands my points and does it much less frequently as before. I’m not sure how your girlfriend spends her money, but my girlfriend doesn’t compromise our savings, because she doesn’t mind cutting down expenses on her food, cosmetics, entertainment, so I’m perfectly fine with that. Some corgi/dog lover may disagree with how I treat our dog, or I shouldn’t feel the burden if I really love my dog, but that’s your fxxking problem, and I wholeheartedly admit I love our dog, and I walk my dog every single day, I make sure he is well-fed, I make sure I play with him whenever I can, I do what I feel is right to love my dog, just not up to your expectations. Just because I don’t spoil my dog as much as you “dog lovers” do, it doesn’t mean I don’t love my dog. It’s like buying your kids PS4, LV wallet, ipad pro, supreme clothes, yeezy shoes, just so that your kids will be happy, but not everyone can afford such luxuries.

97611,"How often do couples go on dates in a week?My bf and I have been together for 8 months now, we met via a dating app and things progressed from there. In our initial days, we agreed to meet just once a week due to school commitments and wanting to give one another enough time to spend with our own separate groups of family and friends. However, now when we are no longer have school commitments and have both started working; have more cash and time to spare for one another, he still insists on meeting just once a week, and only meeting twice a week in the event of emergencies or as a 'make up' for not meeting up on another week. I feel that our relationship is very organised. On every date we went for, we would also plan ahead for the activities and food to eat on our next date. While I have asked him to meet up twice a week occasionally (not every week, perhaps once a month or once every 2 weeks) with the extra date just spending some time together for dinner instead of spending long hours together. He declined, saying that he would have no time for his family or friends if he were to do so. While he mentioned that we could meet twice a week when there's an emergency such as when I needed him over to help with something, there's always a reason for him not being able to be present when the situation calls for it (~3 times so far), such as he will be having dinner with his family/friends later hence he is unable to come over to help me etc. Sometimes he would only respond 4-5 hours later claiming he is asleep or playing games and did not realise I was texting him. Whenever I turned to my friends for help instead, they often wonder why my bf is barely available in this case. I'm starting to wonder if i am even a priority to him, or just a once-a-week commitment. I don't think I am asking too much just by increasing the frequency of meeting up to twice a week occasionally as most of my friends and siblings meet up with their S.O 4-5 times a week on average.-#97611: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97611","['Like: 36 people', 'Sad: 16 people', 'Haha: 8 people']",52 comments,10 shares
97608,"I really need to rant this out. I’m open to any possible good advice. Before I rant this out, I just want to let you guys know that I love pets, be it dogs or cats, or even smaller ones like guinea pigs or hamsters, and I have nothing against pets at all.My gf has a pet corgi, and as I mentioned earlier, I like dogs, so I love her dog as well, but I feel that my gf has gone too far in terms of treating her corgi to the point of where I think she treats her dog better than herself. Since this is her first pet dog, I thought it was okay to be treating her dog in such exaggerated ways, at least for the first few months, but apparently her dog’s 3rd birthday is coming up soon, yet I never see her stop splashing so much money on her dog.Not only does she buys her dogs snacks from pet shops that can easily cost like $20, she also feeds him with expensive meat like salmon together with branded dog biscuits. My gf doesn’t really take cab unless really necessary, but cos she is so into her dog that she wanna brings him to wherever she goes, and since public transport doesn’t allow pet, so she often takes cab just so that she can bring her dog along too. I actually asked her why can’t she just leave her dog at home, and guess what, she yelled at me for being a heartless person who has the gut to abandon our pet at home. She seriously thinks that leaving your dog at home when you’re out means you’re indirectly abusing your dog. When I told her, hey but you also leave your dog at home when you go to work, but she said that’s because she has no choice, else she’ll definitely bring her dog to work too. Besides that, she would also bring her dog to some outdoor or pet-friendly restaurants or cafes, including those at MBS cos according to her logic, her corgi will also enjoy the scenery and be delighted just like us. As you guys might have guessed, yes, as she dines at those restaurants/cafes, she would order extra so that she can feed her corgi with those expensive food as well. I kid you not, she even feeds him with steak from Bread street kitchen! You guys might be thinking oh well if that’s her money and she can afford, and she thinks that makes her dog happy, so that’s her business. The truth is her salary is slightly above 3k, and she is still paying off her uni bank loan, supporting her retired parents, and barely has any savings left every month. And also, sometimes I’m the one who pay for our bills but she still insists on ordering some meat of healthier choice for her dog. Right now we’ve been together for 2 years and we’re actually considering to settle down and buy a flat, but I have no idea how I should bring this up to her. I mean, it can’t be me the one who fully support the housing cost right? I don’t mind paying more than half of it, and in fact I tend to pay for our bills more often during outing. Given the fact that her corgi can easily spend up to $100-200 a week, I seriously think that she should be more logical and start thinking rationally for the sake of our future. I sometimes find her really childish for being so overly attached to the dog. She also gets all excited when kids run towards her corgi and start petting him or taking pictures of him. Any good advice peeps?-#97608: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97608","['Like: 53 people', 'Haha: 22 people', 'Angry: 5 people']",106 comments,21 shares
97605,"Hi all. I think my friend is somewhat delusional but i don’t know how to tell her. She believes she is a psychic/medium who can read ppl’s minds and claims she have spirit friends... I wanted to give her my support at first and tried to listen to whatever she has to say regarding her beliefs. I usually just listen without commenting much… But the more she tells me, the more i think she is just being scammed by the shops who are selling these things to her. For example, she bought a stone crystal (which can be found at taobao for $4, for over $1000 as apparently there is a spirit(like a vampire or something) inside which gives her powers). She also bought some spirits which doesn’t come with anything, claiming that it will be bound to her soul. She said she can see/hear the spirit and ask them to do things/favours for her… and she 100% believes it works.She even encouraged me to get a spirit but I don’t really believe in these things.. and I’ve made myself clear too.She is a very smart person in general, smarter than me i think… so idk how i can approach this topic with her while still being  respectful to her beliefs. Her partner also knows she is doing all these things, but he seems fine with it??? I am quite worried as she has spent probably more than 10k(very low estimate) on this “hobby”?

97602,"Now that I think about my JC and high school days, it seems that some teachers honestly take their jobs too seriously. Do some of them get a kick out of being rude and mean to teenagers? Don't get me wrong, being a teacher is a legitimate and respectable job, but some teachers really bring this ""I'm better than you"" mentality to their jobs. I had this teacher in high school who gained notoriety for being mean to every teenager. There was once I was asked to arrange the tables after school, and he told me that I could not go home until after he has come to make sure that the tables were in order. I waited in the classroom for 3 hours after school until he came, after held me there for an additional 2 hours. He would come to the classroom, tell me to think about what was wrong, without telling me anything else, and he would leave for an hour. By the time I reached home that day, it was 8pm. My parents were furious.My dad, who was a regional managing partner of an MNC at the time, found this completely unacceptable. He came to school the next day and demanded to meet this teacher. My teacher's justification for his ""punishment"" was so I could learn discipline. My dad told him straight in the face, ""I have greater ambitions for my son other than to become a teacher of children. If he follows your values that's where he will end up. This isn't discipline. This is just teaching my son how to be a slave."" I never saw that teacher again.I've now just graduated from an Ivy League university and my first job paid 200k USD in 2020, and I wonder if that teacher still thinks his antiquated army-style form of education is right. I'm sure many still do.-#97602: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97602","['Like: 67 people', 'Haha: 23 people']",37 comments,12 shares

97580,"Hi again, Im the OP of 97554. I have read thr the previous comments and hear to answer some questions: Im definitely given birth by my mom and dad. Im not adopted. ( tho i moght as well be). My younger sister who is adored is only 16 years old ( opening a company needs to be arnd 18 i think? ) so thats out of the question. They cant use my elder sister as well as she is currently overseas and my mom said it is inconvenient if any documents need to be signed, she wont be here. My elder sis and I are beaten up since young. But my younger sister is adored. Long story short. When me and my elder sis was young my father just started is company. So he was in a lot of stress ( what my mom said). So whenever he is stressed he took it out on me and my elder sis. Since young (even until now) i was told to just suck it up and understand that he is stressed, and that i need to respect him no matter what as at the end of the day, he is my father. Since my elder sis left singapore. I was the only one he can sorta vent his anger out on. One reason why my younger sister is able to get doted on because she knows when to go "" dadddddyyyy pls get this for me.... i want this"" (idk what 撒娇 is in english pls halp). I dont do it to him cos i feel disgusted. As for those who ask if i have anyone whom i can talk to. I have an amazing bf, friends and my grandparents. I dont talk to my grandparents about this however, because they tend to over worry about me which is really not good for their health. My bf tells me not to agree too. But i just need some other advices. I have not talk to my friend because i just dont want to burden them with this. Plus they wont be sure how to handle. ( told them about a similar situation before but theu dont really know... which i dont blame them at all!!!)As for moving out. I was planning to move out once i graduate. Just because it is a good timing to do that. I can finish my studies and then just walk away. My mom said i have to give them 25% of my salary the moment i start working (it is unfilial if i dont) but im leaving for good after my graduation. So i wont be giving them a cent. They have 3 other children so money for them isnt an issue. My dad has a huge amount of cpf as well. I am from nursing. So sponsorship money is used to pay my uni. (1000$ per month).  So i technically dont have enough money to move out as of now. But i will have a job almost immediately after graduation. So salary/finance wont be an issue once i move out after graduation. My dad was bankrupt due to other party not able to return them money for a certain project, resulting in him not able to pay his supplier. He did say that after is bankrupcy (he has 2 or 3 more years) he will change the name back to his own name. Hope this helps u guys understand the situation. I will be saying no to then definitely. But the reason why i am so anxious abt saying no is because of the shit attitude and treatment i will be facing once i say no. I so tired to deal with that because as you know asian family, u are the biggest SINNER if u dont help ur family members especially ur PARENTS.-#97580: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97580","['Care: 19 people', 'Like: 17 people', 'Sad: 5 people']",25 comments,1 share
97574,"Have been in NS for a few months now and my relationship is starting to take a toll on me.Obviously, I love my girlfriend and I see us getting married in the future. But her behaviour towards me whilst I am serving the nation has been very lacking.I try to text her everytime I get a chance to use my phone but she doesn’t seem to understand and appreciate the fact that I actually am unable to have my phone nor use my phone whenever I want to. Freedom is very limited here and it just doesnt seem to register in her.I am also often nagged at by her, being told things like im not doing things right or I couldve done xxx better. Being already tired to the daily training regime, her messages are often demoralising and I really dont appreciate her lack of encouragement and love.There has been times during lights out where she would unintentionally start a fuss (either at or not at me) right before I head to sleep and this often disallows me to go to bed on time and get ample rest. I would then have to stay up till she feels better before I feel like im allowed to go to bed. Initially, I thought it was fine because maybe she was unaware that I am tired. But this has been happening constantly and ive just so tired and I cant seem to tell her how I feel. Even on the topic of sex, she does not seem to realise that I am tired? I am expected to initiate and do ALL the work. Sometimes i would like it more if she would just give me a good time instead of the opposite.I thought it would be understandable that men serving NS are having a tough time adapting to the military lifestyle and through the physically intensive training.  All I want is for her to show me she loves me and supports me for what I do. To all women who have their significant other in the army, please do your part to tell them you love them and support them whenever you can. We do not receive a lot of emotional support other than from our loved ones being inside here. We really would appreciate for you to compromise more for us and make our lives easier and better.-#97574: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97574","['Like: 26 people', 'Haha: 7 people', 'Sad: 4 people']",22 comments,3 shares

97558,"I've met someone who I have gotten along with superbly. We flirt a lot and very often, though mostly in a joking manner, with a lot of physical touching given we're both touchy people. Recently, we've been spending a lot of time together, and I've found myself catching some feelings for her, especially since she's brought some much missed light back into my life. This is unfortunate, given she has a boyfriend (which I was only made aware of after a few months of us meeting, given she's mostly quiet on it, and is actually quite reluctant to mention his existence), though she's often communicated to me that she thinks it is only a matter of time before they separate given certain issues in their relationship. While this is obviously theoretically positive news for me, I do not wish to contribute in any way to their separation, and am extremely reluctant to comment on their situation to her, or act on my feelings in any form. But of course, it can be upsetting on my end finding myself in such circumstances, having to interact with her while keeping a lid on my feelings. Additionally, I sometimes worry that the time I spend with her, or that the joking-flirting might cross some boundaries, and lead to trouble down the road.While I would love to continue to be friends, given it has been a great deal of fun spending time with her, I am considering temporarily enacting the nuclear option to cut off contact with her in an attempt to suppress or diminish my feelings for her, and ensure no boundaries are crossed. I just wish to cause no trouble or drama, though it might potentially be a selfish course of action to do so. Obviously, I am unsure of what I should do, so I am here to seek out advice.

97554,"Hi, i have a pretty urgent issue that i need help with. Hope admin wont filter this. So background info. I was always violently beaten up by my dad, to the point he will use metal rods to hit me and throw chairs at me. He constantly verbally abused me, saying im useless and why dont i just go die. But me being in an asian household, i thought it was normal so i have to just suck it up. So it lasted till my 20s. As u can tell i wasnt his favourite... my sister has it totally different. She was adored and spoilt by my dad. Everything she wants she can have it. She can lash out at my parents and they wont even be angry. What a joke. So it has been a year since my dad ever talked to me. (Which honestly i couldnt care less... ) due to some trivial issues where he thinks i didnt help him in the way he wants me to. So since young we have the habit of greeting any elders whom we see. I greeted him initially. After almost a year... i stopped because i heard from my brother that my dad gives a disgusted look when i call him or when he sees me walk by. My mom scolded me for this. But she never understood me. Because if she did she will know i hate rejections and after being rejected with a disgusted look every single day for a year. Im so done with him or my family. So yesterday, i was the only one at home, and someone was at the door. I thought it was a mailman as i buy tonnes of shit from online shopping. When i was at the door, i saw my dad. So out of respect, i opened the door and greeted him. To my surprise, he acknowledged it. So that night i was kinda happy as i was like... is he gonna talk to me again (i hate him still, but as a daughter, i wanted to be acknowledged). At 4am in the morning, my mom came into my room (she wakes up arnd this timing) and told me she need to discuss something with me. So my dad needs to open a company. But due to him being  bankrupt, he cant use his name. So he has to use someone else. And u guessed it. He wanted to use mine. So it dawned on me that he greeted me because he needs me to do sth... so obviously I didnt wanted him to use. So i gave my mom an excuse that I was having a scholarship, so i wasnt sure if im allowed to do this. (It is a true reason tho). Then she said since im graduating next year, they can wait till next year. So i was like i cant give u promises. She then startes to guilt trip me by saying if i dont help, there is really no one else. Saying that i always dont help them when they are in need (which i do, but they dont care, do they). So i told her i will think about it. This morning arnd 8am she came into my room again and ask me to pass her my sponsorship contract  she will show it to their lawyer to see if i can open a company under my name despite me having the contract. So im at a loss. I definitely dont want to let them use. So can yall help me come up with a way to reject them. (Because if i reject. Im going to get hated for not helping once again). And if there is any law students, can you help me see if this is actually legal? Or will i have any consequences in my credit score etc as my parents are bankrupt. So im sure they cant open a company using their own name.-#97554: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97554","['Like: 36 people', 'Care: 23 people', 'Sad: 22 people']",77 comments,14 shares

I’ve currently been with my gf for about 2 years. She’s very attractive and hot, and I think people agree too as she’s got quite a following on Instagram last time before she deleted her account. I learnt a few months ago that she was seeing this other guy back then before we got together (who was already attach at the time) on the side, and they actually did it many times. To make matters worse she actually did very intimate things like swallowing his.. well you know.. she wouldn’t even swallow mine. I can’t help but constantly think about it, I mean firstly why wouldn’t she swallow mine?? Am I less attractive than the first guy?? and I found out from a friend of mine that she and that guy actually took videos of their acts together at the time (and this is also the friend who told me she swallows), and it’s like a ticking time bomb for me as to when these videos will surface. I can imagine someone doing a stupid prank on our wedding and airing the videos or something.On the surface I’m still trying my best to be gentle and attentive but I’m beginning to think that all this is because of how I find her physically attractive, which will eventually die off logically, especially since she is less intimate with me than with her “ex”. I think a worse part is that if she could do this with some other guy when he is attached then what else could she have done then...-#97552: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97552","['Haha: 35 people', 'Like: 24 people', 'Sad: 6 people']",62 comments,9 shares

Idk if I’m overreacting, you guys can be the judge. I was raised in a very strict household and it took me about a month to be comfortable to hold my bf’s hand. Yea I know it’s pathetic  im not comfortable with contact. Me and my bf booked a staycation at sentosa (this was about 3 months ago) and during this staycation, he touched me in my private places when he thought that I was asleep. I obviously woke up but I was too scared to do anything and I just froze. The next day, I was too awkward to bring it up so I just carried on like nothing happened. I cried in the toilet that morning cause I was so confused as to why a guy that I trusted, loved and respected me (he knows I’m very traditional) would treat me like this.When it happened for the second night, I was too scared to do anything but I gave some physical cues like turning away or pushing him slightly, but he just carried on anyway. He also kissed me when he thought I was asleep, this was my first kiss in my life and it was done to me without my consent. I was really upset because he asked for permission to kiss me when we started dating and I always said no. Mind you, it wasn’t the closed mouth kdrama kiss either, it was the sloppy af kind. I was so disgusted. I left on the third day by faking a family emergency. After the staycation, I sucessfully blocked the traumatic experience from my mind and everything went back to normal. Yes, I’m still dating him. I made excuses for him to why he would do this. I felt like the way I dealt with it was to pretend that it didn’t happen. I think I was in denial because I love him too much. But thinking back about the incident, I don’t think that what he did to me was okay.

I find this very shocking, I always thought that Asian parents typically don't mind pretty much having their child around even past adulthood or even financially supporting them past adulthood. I myself come from Asian family (but not from Singapore) and my parents pretty much would welcome me anytime in their home or if I need anything from them. May someone shed a light on this issue?-#97486: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97486","['Like: 8 people', 'Care: 3 people', 'Love: 1 person']",0 Comments,9 comments
97480,"Singaporeans, a majority of only worry about career and money and relationships the latter usually ignored. I graduated with a law degree overseas ten years ago, aged 31.I married a woman whom I loved a lot.At this time, I was living in a bungalow that my wife and I bought, I had a lucrative business on the side which I had sold a majority of.I secured a job at a law firm and after a year or so of 80-hour work weeks,I then secured a job as a counsel to a large MNC based in Europe. On a 2-year contract I left sg chasing a $1,200,000 a month job I was working 19 hours a day. I never replied to my parents calls nor my wife’s. I missed the birth of my son who died shortly after he was born.I didn't come back; I had no choice our firm was in the middle of a crisis.And I dare not face my family. To cover my grief, I kept working, I slept in the office and also sold off all my shares worth about $30,000,000 for $1 in the same I stared to my best friend, as she was the one I trusted the most to lead the firm also I had no interest in anything. After I had settled all the issues at work, I ended the contract and had to pay some money for ending it early, I also had to help find a replacement. I flew back the same day I handed in my letter to the firm.When I came home, I found a letter from my wife, she had left me, we then got a divorce. I did all this for my family they had a good life in my opinion. I sent my parents for holidays almost every month, I sent about. 50% of my income back to them. The remaining would usually be sent to charities. I paid of my sibling’s medical school fees too.And the rest to my wife, she got to live as a tai tai, over the years she spent almost $1,200,000 just on cars and Designer stuff.These are things I had no interest in but in my mind, I believed they kept my family happy. But no, I lost my family too. who moved overseas, they rarely spoke to me?I chased money the almost all the Cs except country club (totally hate most people there)All for my family, I think I never spent more than a day with them those few years.2 years ago, I found out form my in laws my wife had died (I will not specify how) but it was a dagger trough my heart, as I had intended to rekindle our love.I then wandered about for a year ...I have fixed my relationship with my parents who are now in their 70s, they are volunteer teachers, and they spend their time teaching students and helping build schools overseas, they had sold their own home to do this.I let go of everything 30% my money I put in a trust that will be used for charitable causes after I die 20%, I put aside for my SME that I founded to use, if I times of crisis. The remaining 50% I gave it away, I also gave away all the proceeds firm the sale of all my cars and homes and investments. I happy now, I help with my parents. And I work as a pro bono lawyer too.I still cry every night hoping I was not that rich that way my child may not have died. And my wife would be still with me.All the material stuff did not bring me any happiness, only for a second. After that no... just sadness What's worse is that I lost many good friends, and I didn't know and couldn't tell who my friends are back then.Please my fellow Singaporeans success Is best earned and achieved when you find true happiness and you have done your level best to contribute to society and made a positive difference in people’s lives. That will bring you much more happiness. Then any amount of money will.There is so much more to see and to do, let us not be blinded and distracted. by monetary and material gains Instead, please focus on your family, your children’s parents and passions you want to peruse. I hope we can start to value people better rather than who earns the most. or who has a degree or what not.I will give an example.In Singapore we see a Mercedes-Benz, oh wow we go that person must have lots of $$ and likely is successful. In Germany, people see a Mercedes-Benz, “oh look that's my taxi."" regards, A Singaporean who spent 40 years chasing something that truly does not bring value.-#97480: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97480","['Like: 436 people', 'Care: 135 people', 'Sad: 91 people']",85 comments,188 shares

97476,"I am so tired in my relationship.Last night my gf and I were on a date, and I was annoyed she was texting her friends during our date which I find quite disrespectful. Despite me expressing my displeasure, she did it multiple times. When I asked her was there an urgent matter, what was she texting about? She says ""forgot'. She even got super angry at me for daring to be upset that she is texting during our date. One childish move she did was when I was trying to take a photo of one of the dishes which just arrived, she immediately tore into it, as she saw me focusing with my camera. She also lashed out at me and said it must be my fault for being a boring person, which is why she texts on the date. She later retracted this statement and said it was said in a moment of anger, and the real reason she was texting was her friends and her were arranging a meetup for the next day.The next day I told her I barely slept the previous night due to me feeling hurt by a lot of hurtful untrue things she had said to me. She proceeded to verbally abuse me for the next 3 hours. Not only that, she flipped the tables on me and said I was the bad person because I got upset that she got upset at me. I feel so helpless. Over our 2 year relationship, everytime I tell her she hurt me, her response has almost always been to hurt me more. It seems to me that me telling her that she hurt me, shatters her image of herself as the most perfect person ever, so she gets excessively defensive and proceeds to protect herself by putting me down.The other day I also asked her over the last 2 years, she has never apologized a single time or owned any fault in any of our quarrels. I asked if she thinks there is any fault of hers behind any quarrel for the last 2 years? She thought about it then said her only two faults are allowing me to fall in love with her, as well as thinking too highly of me when we got together. Otherwise, every quarrel is completely my fault. I was honestly quite stunned by her response.Another thing she does is she loves to yell over me, insult me, then suddenly disappear or block me in any disagreement. I think it is a childish way for her to get the last word in and to frustrate me as then I have no way to respond. She will then proceed to have fun for hours or days while I feel anxious and stressed. She will then abruptly reappear at some point, write insulting or hurtful words to me, or call me to say these, then block me again before I can even respond. This cycle then repeats for a few rounds until she has had her fill.What makes me even more upset is she will always make me out to be the bad person. She will also lie and twist reality to support her version of what happened. She will then badmouth me to her friends then come back to me and tell me how ""everyone"" supports her. The interesting thing is she is a very popular person, with a very happy and outgoing public image. I often cannot reconcile how she can be such a monster behind closed doors. This also means that if I say out, no one will believe me also.Breakup is easy, can just walk away, so I am hoping not to have to do that unless really no choice. Is there any hope of reforming a girlfriend like her? 2 years is a lot to throw away.-#97476: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97476","['Like: 48 people', 'Sad: 34 people', 'Care: 11 people']",152 comments,21 shares

97471,"I met my bf some time last year. Things are going pretty smoothly for us, both of us are pretty busy with our work schedules on a daily basis.Now we are just two very busy adults working non stop, things can get so busy with either of us that we can even not see each other for two weeks.His family is really nice and I really love his family. They are so loving and would invite me over for dinners. I have to admit I am at fault for being unable to attend the dinner sometimes due to my busy schedule.He would also meet his friends just for some casual drinks, almost every other day.His parents did mention to me that he had been drinking till late, and that they are worried about him drinking and smoking. They tried to hint me trying to make him quit smoking, but it’s not that easy given the fact that all his friends smokes. I’m not one who would control what he wants to do. I believe that he is old enough to know what is he doing. I mean he’s already an adult, no longer a juvenile. Just at times, I don’t know how to actually react to his parents “requests”. I understand his parents’ POV and “request” meant no harm as they just wanted him to be healthy too. They too, did remind me not to push him too hard if I were to ask him to quit smoking or drink lesser. They just don’t know how they can “remind him” anymore because if they do, they some how turns it into a nagging session and it kinda pisses him off. Till now I have yet to speak to him with regards to his parents “request”. I’m just afraid that things might turn not so nice between them as he is slowly getting a bit nicer to his family now as compared to before.-#97471: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97471",['Like: 5 people'],0 Comments,6 comments
97470,"Are men still expected to pay for all the food and dates? It's not a big deal deal to me (22), I'm just curious what everyone thinks. Both my mom and dad asked me recently if my boyfriend (23) treats me food or if we pay for our own food. My mom thinks boyfriends should always pay for girlfriends and my dad thinks my boyfriend is too calculative. They both have a very traditional idea of courtship but ironically (or not) they are divorced. I didn't feel like lying to them so I just said that we take turns to pay, and tried to defend him by saying that he's still studying, like I am, and not earning any money yet. Chivalry sounds nice and all because who wouldn't want to be spoiled with gifts and free food? I wouldn't expect it because obviously times have changed but I feel bad that my parents are stuck in this idea and seem to not have the best impression of my boyfriend. Especially because he's quite introverted he doesn't usually make extra efforts to reach out to my family and my friends, so my friends and family always question our relationship. They don't challenge it outright and I've told my boyfriend about it whenever it happens as well....he doesn't seem to care...but it's not ideal because I obviously would like the people I care about to get along well (especially with my family, I wish I could be closer with them but these things make it hard).

97469,"Dear #96224, After reading your confession, I truly thought for a second that I was the one writing that.. My ex was exactly the same as your boyfriend. When we were together we met around once a week or slightly less. We lived really far from one another and he preferred to study alone. Although I did mention a couple of times he can come over to study if he wants, he would always say that he dont want and can only study at home. Because of his heavy school load, we would not have much time left for each other. Especially towards mid-terms period aand towards finals, sometimes we would only meet once a month and honestly I was ok with it as he was busy. I have told him many times that I prefer we met up more and we do not have to go out for fun dates (for long hours) we can just meet up occasionally for lunch or study dates in between our busy schedule.. or we can even just facetime each other.. but it never happened. Afterwards, he started a new business venture that took up even more of his time. We broke up as I could see that I am no way his priority and he said that going out with me has become more of a burden after a while. He claimed that he still loved me and I will still be his best friend no matter what. And let me tell you this, its all bullsht. We still follow each other on instagram as we are still friends. He has been going out a lot to study and just doing things he claimed he didnt prefer doing when he was with me. Aside from this issue of not spending enough time with me, there were other minor issues which would have amounted to gigantic redflags added together. But what made me waited so long before ending it was because even now after breaking up for almost one year, I still love him.To all the ladies out there, love yourself first. If the man does not treat you with respect and treats you well, learn to let go early. After breaking up, I thought, should I have compromised or maybe should I have been more understanding? If he has valid reasons for doing what he did, should I have waited for him to be less busy? Dont lower your standards for anyone is what Ive always believed in, but when you are faced with that situation, its damn f-ing hard to let it go.-#97469: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97469",['Like: 46 people'],4 comments,5 shares

At first, I thought it was because my ex and I broke off too sudden hence I did not get the closure that I wanted. So realising this, we (my ex and I) talked and everything was ok i got the closure I wanted but I still think of him. The reason why he break up with me is because he feelings faded when he was in ns and he no longer have feelings for me since then. I am clueless as to why I still think of him and I don’t want to tell my partner about it as I don’t want to hurt his feelings.

I’ve now been in the job for 1.5months and I am not sure on how to manage the person I report to. She is alws late to our meetings or changes the time on the last hour of the meeting. She expects me to text her after she asked me to email her things she requested for at a certain time and then told me off when I didn’t inform her that I have emailed her. The last straw was she made a big deal in a group chat of other people on how 1) I didn’t submit something she requested by deadline(she sent me a lot of things 2) I did submit but I couldn’t access the link so I sent via email 3) she got a bitch fit and criticise me in the group chat that consist of few people including a store manager who reports to me. She said that I shouldn’t make her go into the file in and out for that 2-3 mins. I feel that she’s rude, domineering, micromanaging and just unrealistic. She kicked up a big fuss when she needed something from me but she took days to reply an email from me.My best friend advised me not to leave but to face her. I think it’s because she’s one of the most senior, most of the things get slided over. I know most workplaces are toxic but perhaps there are someone who can give me tips to manage this kind of “bosses”?

97464,"How do those working find the energy to date and maintain a relationship? I am working for close to 2 years now. I'm in an industry that is relatively well paying but is pretty demanding and has long hours. Even now as I wfh about half of the week, it's common to OT 3-4 times a week and occasionally on weekends to clear the work. I'm also helping to care for a family member with health problems and that takes another big chunk of my free time. In my past relationship, I was too busy during work hours to reply my ex as I have tons of work messages coming in. After work, I'd be too tired to think of nice stuff to say to my ex. Often my replies are incoherent and doesn't sound too enthu. On weekends when I have some precious little free time to myself, I'd just crash and want to sleep it out instead of going out with my ex. Over time, we met and talked less and eventually broke off. Now, I am trying out my luck on dating apps. Though I have a few promising matches, the conversations slowly fizzled out as I saw history repeating itself. I just find myself too tired to date. What should i do? Is it just not possible for busy people to date?

97459,"I started my internship about 3 months ago and I found out from my colleagues that there’s this permanent employee (lets name him as M) that seems to show interest in me. We didn’t have a chance to talk to each other as M is in another department while I am in human resource department. The first time we had a proper conversation was when one of my co-workers from the same department asked me to join them at the smoking area. We were both introduced to each other formally for the first time and subsequently we have been smoking together with the others. M would always say nice comments on the outfits I wear to work or the way I style my hair, buying me drinks or treating me to me lunch but I always politely decline. At the start I felt uncomfortable, but he is married so I thought he treats me like his own daughter as he is twice my age. However, I was having finals a few weeks back and took a week off from work to study for my finals. After I return back to office, one of my colleague told me and said that M kept asking about my whereabouts and looked very sad throughout the week when I was not in office, and they conclude that it is because of me. I just brushed it off, telling them it is just coincidence as he is married and wouldn’t have interest in me. So fast forward, M asked me out for drinks 2 days ago during the weekend and said that the other colleagues are joining too, so I accepted the invite and went to drink with them. But turns out when I reach the bar, he already started drinking and said that the others are not coming as they have plans last minute. I wanted to leave as I don’t feel comfortable drinking or spending time alone with him, so I went out of the bar, but he chased after me and confessed to me and said he really like me. He was high from all those drinks and even placed his hands around my waist. I struggled to break free but he went ahead to kiss me on my lips. I was shocked and pushed him away and ran home. I ran home and cried, and went to tell my supervisor that I want to leave the company with immediate effect.

97460,"Gonna be long, TLDR: Looking for advice on pursuing a private Data Science or Business Analytics degree because my GPA is trash (2.2), and I really am a blur fuck.First off, I have a bad GPA because a lot of unfortunate and unforeseen events happened in my personal life that have caused me to be unstable during my polytechnic years, and that resulted in my abysmal GPA, having to retake multiple modules because I can't focus on my studies (but also because I'm blur) but more on that later. I accept full responsibility for my poor performance and would like to carve a better future for myself by taking a degree.Personally, my interests lie in Data Science. To sum it up, I like the way it is so logical, and so rational. Data is literally an abstraction of reality and that I can see myself organizing and managing data structures yadayada, Also, someone with a Data Science degree can perform the roles of a Business Analyst and not the other way around, so I thought it'd be pretty good to study Data Science, so my knowledge would be deeper and my scope would be wider.However, here are the cruxes,Data Science is heavy on CS and I can't help but think that Professor Ben said that one's performance in CS is very dependent on their aptitude, and that has been holding me back a lot on whether I should pursue Data Science or Business Analytics as the former is more CS intensive, whereas the latter has a bit of Data Science and Business, which I am also fairly interested in. Given my horrible 2.4 GPA from poly, I am afraid that even passing the the degree would be unnecessarily strenuous and that I would always be constantly behind my classmates.Furthermore, I read that many Data Scientists often hold a masters degree, and unless I do so in a field already full of superhigh IQ peeps, I'll always be lagging behind the restPerhaps, I was thinking, take a Business Analytics degree, then take Data Science courses externally? I wish I could end things here, but I cannot.To make things worse, I am also insanely careless. I suspect I might have ADHD, idk. All along as I'm studying, I am often losing a solid 20-30% of my marks in my Math and Sciences because of stupid mistakes (wrote a + instead of a - or read the question wrongly, like 3 times??? ) It's ridiculous and I don't understand how I'm plagued with this. Even irl I am slightly dysfunctional, I keep dropping my phone, and I've been told I'm a type A neat freak, which makes it worse because even if my things are so neat and my belongings are in plain sight, I simply MISS IT COMPLETELY. It strains my relationships with those who I live with, and even army is stressful because I'm a total blur fuck. Looking for my water bottle high and low in bunk when I left it back in stadium, to the amusement of my platoon mates.Anyway, I have done some simple programs with Python and I found it incredibly enjoyable except for the parts where I took a solid 4 hours to look for a minor mistake. I am afraid that this part of me would be incredibly exacerbated when I take either of those degrees.Lastly, not sure if it matters but I have an IQ of 110 (taken multiple, free and paid IQ tests to check if the above happened because I am intellectually challenged) and I read that the average IQ of a university student is a 120.

97458,"Serious post. Anybody with experience lodging a complain to CASE under the consumer fair protection act?Recently I bought a second hand bike from a bike shop(it wasn't cheap). The bike shop owner/mechanic said that he ran all diagnostic checks and there were no problems. I rode it around the compound, no major issues so I bought it. But it gave me some issues immediately after I bought it, so I sent it to a workshop near my house and what I thought was a minor problem turned out to be a whole bucket list of problems. Basically this bike mechanic did not tell me what he should have been able to find out through his 'diagnostic tests'. Either he found out and didn't tell me, or he didn't even check it, or he was incompetent. Asked around and apparently a number of other motorists have bad experience with this mechanic. One guy's bike was destroyed after this mechanic failed to tighten a nut in the engine.(nut came loose and destroyed everything in its path when the engine was running). It was obviously his fault but he refused to own up. Unfortunately I don't have his statements on black and white. I was wondering if such a complaint would be successful with CASE? Or what can they do for me, and what else can I provide for then to  solve this problem for me effectively? In short, does anybody know what I can do next? Thanks in advance.

97450,"Dilemma here. Need advice.I was offered Wharton/UPenn, and as of May 1st, I accepted the offer. I was also offered SMU.Thing is, I will receive zero funding from Penn, while SMU is a full-ride for me. My dad's business was very badly hit by the coronavirus and he has assured me that he will be able to fund my Wharton degree even though I know for a fact that he will struggle. SMU would probably be the most sensible choice for me, but my dad desperately wants me to go to Wharton. I think the money he would spend on my degree would be far better utilised if capitalised in our business. Since his plan for me is to take over his business, I honestly don't see how much value a Wharton degree would add to my career. His rationale for going to Wharton is I will get a much a better education in terms of living independently, rubbing shoulders with students who were raised in highly successful families, and experiencing a foreign country. More crucially, he wants me to dilute my excessive ""Singaporean-ness"" with regards to army-style rule-following, risk aversion, and being penny-wise and pound-foolish, traits he collectively coins ""HDB mentality."" He explained that all of this will help me run a business much more competently.I am open to going to Wharton, I just want to do it for logical reasons. My dad is a lot older and has experience running a highly successful business. I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt that his reasons have merit. I have no way of knowing otherwise.

97439,"I could not find any answers online so here goes.My daughter is too sensitive and mature. She is 10. We have a happy family. My husband and I are happily tgt. A few times when she told me she made plans with her friend (our neighbour) and I commented that I planned a family dinner, she would immediately cancel on her friend.Once she was on her way back from tuition (just across the street from our house), she texted me to say she saw some nice and cheap t shirts and asked me if I wanted. I said OK if they are cheap. I didnt know by the time I replied she already reached home! She went back across the street to buy. On the surface it looks nice to have such a great child but I have learnt that she listens so much to the point where she will sacrifice herself for others. Now I'm at a point where I have to think twice before I say anything. It's kind of tiring tbh. I'm not sure how many parents out there have children like this. My biggest fear is that I will unknowingly hurt or influence my child's decision somehow somewhere bcus she listens/cares too much. I don't want her to cancel plans with her friends just bcus of me. Idw to be the reason she doesn't have a childhood. Do any of you understand this situation? It's really more tiring than raising a immature child. You have to be so careful at every step. I have to specifically makes comments like  ""don't go if you are alrdy at home."" or ""Mummy can handle this alone."". Otherwise she will feel obligated to tag along. She feels that it is her responsibility to tag along. Once I told her I'm not cooking anymore and told her to go with her friends just so that she will go. I think even this hurt her. I could tell from her facial expression. Once in a while, she would use some of her saving to buy sweets for her friends. Tbh I don't like her doing this. Once is OK but... I told her she should spend the money on herself. I'm saying this partly bcus I know her friends won't reciprocate. I'm not saying we do things only to get sth back. Aiya Yall adults know what I'm saying lah. Idw her to become a laughing stock or sth. I'm sure yall have met people who give too much and they themselves end up don't get any help bcus most ppl don't care. I have been trying to teach her to protect her own interest. It is okay to give but we need to grasp the right amount. Once she gave all her biscuits away and lied that she still had some more in her bag. Good thing she has a good friend who knows her well enough. I asked her why she lied. She said she lied because she knew if she said she had no biscuits then her friends would have to give up theirs to give to her. It hurts me bcus the truth is most people don't care. Most people won't bother to ask if you have any biscuits. Just bcus they asked doesn't mean they care. Yall know what I mean. They asked just to ask. Even if you said you have no biscuits how many will share?? Do yall understand my frustration?? Those biscuits belong to her to begin with. She bought them using her own money. She was once accidentally locked in the classroom by the class monitress. She went to hide herself and rejoined the class when they were back from morning assembly like nth happened. I asked her why. She said if she made a fuss, the classmate would get scolded. Once she fell sick during some CIP. She refused to say anything until her good friend told the teacher. I asked her why she didn't voice earlier. She said bcus she wasn't done with her part yet and if she left her classmates would need to do more. I told her she should stop because of herself. She is really intelligent but gives too much.-#97439: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97439","['Like: 185 people', 'Care: 152 people', 'Love: 41 people']",74 comments,82 shares
97438,"A few more days to my birthday and I look forward to my birthday every year. Only issue I have is the present part.My family and friends always ask what I want for my birthday but I always say i don't know, even though I do have items I want. I will eventually get them on my own because of what happened to me in the past.I used to date an abusive bf who abused me mentally and emotionally. He would constantly say that I should be grateful to have him as I'm so ugly and fat that nobody will ever want me. I stayed for a few years and eventually realised how wrong he was when another guy started to chase me.And i remembered, on my birthday, my then bf said he felt bad and wanted to love me better. And he knew I wanted a couple ring all along. Back then, none of his friends and family knew about me. He never wanted to tell anyone I'm his gf, but expected me to announce to the world that he is my bf.Fast forward, on my birthday, he gave me a couple ring. I was so happy that I decided to stay with him. Few days later, he laughed and said ""wow, I never knew anyone can be so stupid like you. $88 for a present can make you stay. You cheaper than prostitute leh.""I was so heart broken and yes, I ultimately left him. He was really angry at first and he came to find me and beat me up. But I'm glad my friends came to my aid after receiving my SOS call.It's been many years but this incident still sting.

97434,"Hello, I am a polytechnic graduate in business and thankfully have received admission offers from both NUS and SMU for Business Admin. I'm stuck between the two - NUS has been a dream of mine since young but SMU is a great school as well. I really wish to go to NUS, however I heard that the lecture style is much like JC instead of SMU which is like poly where I am more familiar with. Also, I do know that NUS is great for hall life which I really want to experience but my parents are against that as I'm a female haha. I'm just really torn between the two, plus I'm a rather shy person but I wish to step out of my comfort zone and join CCAs and orgs in uni. Can anyone give me any advice / an insight to what it's really like to be an NUS student if I do not take part in hall life? Will it still be as exciting if I only join CCAs and orgs?

97426,"Hi admins, I need to get this off my chest. I have developed feelings for this girl in my workplace. We are working for a big co. We met in 2019 and it was through a company event in that year that we met each other. She is in a management role while I am in a junior role. We are in different departments but our respective departments have to be in close coordination in order for the co to function well.She is a friendly, outgoing and nice girl. She's 27/28 while I am 24. We would always get to see each other in the main hq until somewhere late last year, she was redeployed to one of the co's branch. We are on very good terms and she would always offer me tips and advice how to adjust and motivate me to do well. We would sometimes stop for a short chat and joke with each other. I must admit, I am attracted to her but I have been suppressing my feelings for her. She mentioned she has a boyfriend and from the picture she uses as her W.A. profile pic, I can tell he is a good person. I am now stuck, should I let her know my feelings for her or should I suppress it for life until the day I die? I don't want to break them up as that will be a serious breach of bro code and ruining my friendship with her but I really would like to be with her. Please advice.

97422,"I'm a girl studying law and I have a boyfriend in business. Our relationship has been going really well, but recently my boyfriend has started acting rather strangely. Whenever we meet new people and someone asks me what course I'm doing, before I have a chance to answer he blurts out 'FASS' and then changes the subject. I don't correct him because I don't want to embarrass him in front of other people, and when I ask him about it in private he keeps saying that he just gets FASS confused with Law because 'they sound similar'. I asked him if it was because FASS is lower than his course on the IGPs, but he says that's just a coincidence. Also, I can't watch Netflix with him anymore because he keeps trying to spoil every episode while we're watching it. I've asked him to stop but he insists that they can't be spoilers because he hasn't seen the show, he just has psychic powers. When I pointed out that Iron Man was unlikely to make an appearance in Bridgerton, he made some unintelligible screeching noises and left the room in tears. Another time I woke up to find him standing over me with bags under his eyes. As soon as he noticed I was awake he announced that he knew 'all eight digits of pi' and smugly rattled them off. I waited for him to finish before telling him that I didn't think the third digit was a 6, and a quick google search confirmed that he had spent the early hours of the morning memorising what appeared to be the telephone number for a massage palour at Parklane Shopping Centre. I love him but I don't know how much more of this I can take. I would appreciate if anyone who has been in a similar situation could give me some advice on how to make him feel less insecure about his intelligence?

97421,"My bf cheated on me while I was away for study in overseas. He had an affair with someone who’s a lot older than him. She’s around 40. I and my bf got to know her through our mutual friend. At that time, I thought she’s kind, smart and someone who had upright character and I respected her. But she did something I couldn’t imagine. They had an affair secretly behind my back and they hid their relationship from everyone. I felt being betrayed by both of them when I found out. I couldn’t do anything that time and just let him go as what he wanted, since I was in overseas and they were together. She’s smart indeed. She knows how to control and manipulate him. Everything what she did was good in his eyes. Few years have passed and until now, they still keep their relationship in secret. He stays at her house as a tenant and they’re living together. They pretend as they’re good friends. She feigns as a sweet, kind, honest and decent lady. And people believe her. But I don’t think what she did is decent. He didn’t contact me since then, but he still talks to my siblings occasionally. My siblings didn’t know he cheated on me as I didn’t tell anyone. I don’t want to ruin his image. We’re best friends before we fell in love. I really love him so much. I want him back. I want to be together with him. I don’t want him to be with someone who wants to hide their relationship.

97420,"I met a guy on a dating app and the initial convo leading to the first date was really great and filled with flirtatious banters. I could tell the guy made efforts to communicate with morning/good night greetings, pretty fast replies, and fun questions with a general curiosity in me. The date went pretty ok albeit convos got pretty heavy till the end which I got quite tired. But I’m still interested in seeing him and get to know him more.After the date we still tried texting but I felt the pace got much slower and he isn’t flirting as much (not sure if I’m being too sensitive here). Though he still pleasantly replied and tried to carry the conversation forward, it just didn’t felt as fun as it was before we met. I also felt he isn’t putting in as much effort to communicate anymore and convo topics were flat. He did say the upcoming 2-3 weeks will be pretty stressful/busy for him with a big exam ahead and he said we should go out for a drink after that, though no dates were pinned.Right now our last convo had just naturally ended and he hasn’t looked for me the past few days. I’m quite disappointed as I really felt a connection earlier. Is he just (super) busy or is he no longer interested?

97415,"I'll be getting the keys to our new 4 room BTO in a few months. Wld like to ask some advice from homeowners: is it worth it to get an interior designer and go for a premium reno?We have been shopping around for reno packages. For a basic reno, we have been quoted from 30-50k. We have also approached a few interior designers and their packages ranges from 100-150k. We are particularly impressed by the offering from one interior designer. They are famous in this field and promised a luxurious experience after the reno is completed. They showed us many projects they have completed and the final product is just comparable to a luxury hotel. They would use premium materials and many of the furnishings are imported overseas. The price quoted to us is about 130k inclusive of all furnishing but excluding any electrical items. If we were to go for this, we would empty out any remaining savings we have and need to take an additional reno loan of 80k. Both of us came from humble backgrounds and particularly for me, have lived in a cramped and messy 3 room hdb in the past and really want to experience the luxury living. We are not high earners and earn around the median income in sg, ard 4k for each of us.

97412,"Hello! I’m 31 this year and have been a stay home mom for the last 5 years. Recently, I scored a job in an NGO research division after months of job search and I’m happy to re-enter the workforce after the long hiatus. Pay-wise it’s a little bit lower than the average Singaporeans’ salary but I’m grateful and want to make a good experience out of it. I read many stories of the high salaries people my age earn and sometimes I feel like I set myself back by being a SAHM for that long, but anyways life goes on and I will make the best of what opportunities I have. The new job is more centred on the development of women’s rights and issues as well as child development, which is an area I’ve grown an interest in since I became a wife and mother. I have an Economics degree and sometimes I feel like this sector has nothing to do with what I studied so I’m writing to see if there are other Economics majors out there doing great things for NGOs... besides the usual sectors for such graduates ( ie banking, consultancy, civil service etc..) NGOs don’t sound as sexy as these sectors but they make a huge positive impact on the lives of others and this gives meaning to the job (I hope I don’t sound like as if I’m trying to convince you or myself haha)... What’s the career path like and how do we make an outstanding contribution and develop ourselves within the NGO sector?

It is indeed true that she is smarter since her grades to enter law is much higher than business. She isnt trying to one up you, she would have just taken a law boyfriend rather than you but you dont seem happy, so just break up since youre inferior. But you cant say no to her cause u need her money.if its the guy in law and the girl in biz, ppl gonna say the girl gold digger but if its the other way round like now, ppl gonna say she feeding the guy. Either way ppl are gonna say something - so if you are so affected by others that it causes a strain on your relationship, just do her a favor, breakup and find a business gf. She can be free to find a law bf and own law firms in futureThis is probably why so many med students in my faculty date among ourselves - because we understand each other better than the outside world-Truly, med student-#97411: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97411","['Like: 18 people', 'Haha: 3 people']",4 comments,1 share
97407,"I'm a fresh grad, started my first job 2 weeks ago in a business operations role, under a 1.5 year contract at an IT MNC at $3k salary. The prospects for the role is ok, but not the ideal choice for me. I took on the role as I was  pressured by my family to accept a job and start working before I graduate. I am now working in the same department as my cousin and while he is ~9 years older than me, we are both in the same rank, making things slightly awkward between us at work.Recently, I have been offered a $4.8k FT job offer at another company (local startup), more aligned with my career interest and would definitely avoid the same awkwardness I faced at work now. I'm thinking if I should accept the offer and quit my current job but I'm afraid if it would reflect poorly on me. My friends have been split regarding whether I should take on this new position, as some mentioned that it could possibly take several more years before my pay would rise to $4.5k and my position is more risky as a contract staff. Others said that i should stick on to this role as the company is reputable and it would reflect badly on me if I back out now. I'm torn between staying in my current position and accepting the new offer.

97404,"Is it impossible to accumulate $100 mil unless you go into business?I'm graduating next year and it seems the ""standard"" approach to life is to get a good job, and then work a salary your whole life. I ran the numbers recently and it seems like it is impossible for anyone to become rich this way. Even if you started out with a salary of $400K, which is typical for a partner at a Big 4 accounting firm, over a 30-year career, you would only have earned $12 mil gross. Realistically, it would take more than 15 years to make partner at a Big 4. In the same period, property prices would have doubled 3 times, assuming the adage is true that property prices doubles every 10 years. Even if it only doubles over a 30-year period (very unlikely), a 10,000 sq ft landed property in a prime district like Bukit Timah, which already costs $15 mil now, would be worth $30 mil. $12 mil isn't even half. So, even if you climbed to the top of the corporate ladder, which has a lower probability than being hit by a car, it is unlikely that one would be able to join the GCB-class in Singapore.I'm not saying being middle-class isn't already a good life, and I'm not saying money is everything in life, but it seems that if one were to aspire to own their own landed property in Singapore, the property ladder is already too high to climb for anyone starting out now. I don't even know if I'd be able to afford a condo of the same size as the 3-bedroom HDB flat I grew up in. But even in business, you use to be able to earn very good returns on simple businesses, such as running a chicken rice stall, or a corner shop selling sundries. Nowadays, the margins are so thin that it makes more sense to work a salary. The future seems really bleak for anyone born after the 90s to become really wealthy. I don't want to be an alarmist, but it seems really unfair to people like me, having not much to leverage from their parents, to become wealthy over a single generation. I envy my peers who are taking over their parents businesses, instead of having to slog it out in the workforce, when wage growth is clearly going to be outpaced dramatically by land prices and cost of living.-#97404: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97404","['Like: 43 people', 'Sad: 10 people', 'Haha: 9 people']",66 comments,23 shares
97401,"Hi, SoC alumni here. Seeing the posts about folks looking for internships and jobs, I want to showcase an alternative career path: do a startup. Make a unicorn. Whether you succeed or not, you would be enjoying each day.The general perception is that the chances of success are remote and it is a lot of hard work. Yes, both a true but they do not tell the full story.For one, you won’t be working harder than employees necessarily. I do not see how my work hours will change if I take a job. But what will change is that you will be more motivated if this is your company. And it is easier to then see the upside of grunt work.Also, it is a myth that raising money is hard. I am an average student and I did not even have a deck when raising the first round. You don’t need everyone to believe in your vision, you just need a few angels. And if you believe in the idea enough to spend all your time on it, why would others not? And Singapore is full of early stage investors. It is really a good place to start a company.In a job, you are expected to figure things out. In a startup, your investors will help you do that. You can hire people who know more to help you with whatever you do not know. A startup with a vision to be a unicorn is the only work environment where so many people want to do their best to help you succeed for their own good. I just pick up the phone when I cannot get a sale to close or when the website is taking too long to be built, and investors or advisors suggest ideas. All you then need to do is implement them and ask for help again. Unlike a job, asking for help is a virtue.You will never have a mid life crisis because you will be working om something that changes the world. There would always be purpose and a vision.You decide your timings, you decide the policies etc.. For example, we do work from home because I like sleeping late and starting the day right after I wake up at around 10am. I just need to fetch my computer to start work.And what is failure in a startup? You don’t get enough traction? You can sell the company any time, you will still have created value and you will already be ready to do your second startup after 2 years. It will be easy to do everything the 2nd time around because you are experienced.Finally, this is the only way to change your life radically. A well paying job might net you 250K in savings a year. But will that change your lifestyle? No. And you will likely be spending hours doing tasks you do not completely believe in. A good exit in a startup means your lifestyle will actually change.Boys and girls, consider chasing the unicorn dream. This is the best time in human history to do it. Everyone will support you. NUS Enterprise, private investors, customers, etc. etc.. And you will be changing the world in some meaningful way too if you succeed, how cool is that?-#97401: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97401","['Like: 16 people', 'Haha: 1 person', 'Wow: 1 person']",10 comments,2 shares
97399,"Hi all, in urgent need of constructive advice. I met this guy from my hall in year 1 and have known him for 3 years. He's studying history, which I found really intriguing and attractive when he shares knowledge about the past, etc when we study together. We both bicker with each other a lot at first (even in front of hall mates) but we got closer overtime as we share many similar values. He confessed to me during midterms and I thought I'd give it a try. However, the sudden swap from friends to couple made me realise that I'm not at all physically attracted to him.. I can't stand it when his body odour becomes apparent/doesn't trim his hair/ wears unflattering clothes/etc.. This made me really guilty as I don't want to change him yet I truly can't seem to see past this. I am emotionally attracted to him though. He is seriously the sweetest and most amazing, thoughtful guy/pursuer I've ever had. He always put me first, and has a heart of gold for others which I admire a lot. Many of my friends/hall mates/even my father tbro think well of him.We always have lots of fun togetheraswell.What should I do..? Should I give it more time?

97388,"#97298 Hi, I am the OP of #97298. The previous post was my first time posting to here therefore I do not know I need to paragraph by enter, I am sorry for anyone who have trouble viewing. I had read every comments, whether those that ask me to leave him or stick with him, or said that I am too clingy etc. I appreciated every comments, I previously also read about what PhD studies are all about and decided to post here so I could gain more insights of his PhD life, he rarely told me that he is stressed, but I know all along that he is. I am currently a frontliner working in a hospital, and during my free time I do photography, dancing and study Japanese, other than that I did have my own group of friends, and I hang out with them from time to time. Everyone often ask me, “Do you have time for your BF?” I always smiled and said, “He was the one who doesn’t have time for me.” I admit that I am emotionally attached to him, and I miss him sometimes so I really need to see him physically, not in video call, especially when we are both in Singapore, but he said that he was too busy and sometimes stop me from going over to his place, when he said he got “no mood” to see me, it really crushed me. I am willing to go over to his place at his convenience just to see him. I just don’t understand why he could not give me the time. And usually when we are spending time together, he is reading his study material and I am reading my Japanese class material, I don’t mind if he didn’t talk to me at that time at all. I just want him to be with me for some time. I already talked to him regarding this for a few times but it didn’t really wake him up until I told him I want to break up. Probably it’s the best that we part ways and hopefully he can find someone better or he can finally put his focus on study.-#97388: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97388","['Like: 9 people', 'Care: 3 people']",7 comments,1 share

97386,"This guy and I have been seeing each other for 9 months and we're both in uni. This rs in particular is different to the two relationships I've had in the past where there's actually space between us, so there was a bit of an adjustment period on my part with regards to my abandonment issue, I can confidently say I'm doing a good job managing it though. I didn't bring it up to him because I knew it was a personal issue, and I knew it was something to deal with myself. I knew it was something I had to look inwards for. What I did bring up, however, was that I felt unappreciated and felt that he had no time for me, our conversation was literally only good morning and goodnight, he doesn't ask how I am etc., and I told him that mattered to me, that expressing your love towards someone isn't a grand gesture, but lies in the small actions you do. I told him several times, but although he apologized several times, there was no change in his behavior. I just do my best to understand him, I don't have control over what he does/thinks, but I have control over how I choose to make of things, how I choose to perceive or think of things as. I don't think it's anything personal. I mean, when you get too swamped with studies, you just drown, right? I mean, that's not the case for myself as I always ask him how he is etc even if I'm swamped in studies too, but that doesn't mean it's the same for everyone. He had time to play an hp game with his friends after class, staying up until past midnight - 4 AM, but not enough time to message me, okay, he's probably destressing from studies. There are times when I'm the same, and then when he messages me, it's just a goodnight. Okay, I suppose he's tired. I'd be tired too. It got to a point where I broke down and begged him to at least listen to me, reply to me, or hear me out because I felt like I wasn't being listened to or appreciated or anything. He just ignored me and was watching a movie, and that really hurt me. He told me he wasn't in the mood. Okay, I understand, I wish he'd told me earlier. The next day, he told me he was going through something and I understood, but he still didn't bother to reassure me and continued to ignore my concerns. He told me what specifically what he was going through, and I understood and comforted him and everything, with my concerns not having been brought up since. I guess it's something I'd have to deal with myself, right? I can give that reassurance to myself, I can choose what to think of how I perceive things, but honestly, it hurts a lot. I tried to bring up my concerns again a few times more, but I just get ignored or he tells me he's busy, okay, I understand. Whenever I asked him when it could be talked about, I just got ignored, and I told him that I want him to at least tell me when it could be talked about, but there was nothing again. I just understood him. He must not have the emotional capacity to because of how stressed he is. Okay, I'll do my best to be a supportive and understanding partner. I'll deal with it myself. Honestly, I feel like he has broken my trust in him.. He apologized so many times only for nothing to change. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells being around him, I can't explain it, but sometimes, I think ""is it okay for me to open up to him? Is he in a good mood? Is now a good time to open up to him?"" I know the last question is a good question to think as it's important to be mindful of other people too, not only of yourself, but I don't know if I'm able or I'd be able to open up to him again, the few times I did it, I was just pushed away. Sure, I understand, he had his reasons, but I don't know, it just hurt, and I'm scared of opening up only for the same thing to happen again. I feel like bringing up anything to him doesnt do anything either, since there's no change despite how many times I already brought stuff up. So what I do is just to look inwards. I just work on myself. I just do my best to reframe how I think about stuff. After all, I'm the only one I have control over. No point stressing over what I don't have control over, right? Might as well just accept it.Meanwhile, whenever he's down, even if I'm busy, I comfort him immediately/reassure him/listen to him/anything. When I get those uncomfortable feelings anytime at all lately, I deal with it myself. I don't bother bringing it up to him anymore. It's a me problem anyway. I just journal out whatever thoughts or feelings I have in mind and they go away. I think I'm doing great actually, I like that I don't seek reassurance from him anymore, and that I give it to myself.However, I want to ask, is this normal? Oftentimes, I think about what if I feel an uncomfortable feeling again in the future? I know he is not responsible for my feelings though, but what if it's about me feeling unappreciated etc again? Can I open up to him? I honestly cannot answer that question. I don't know if I can. I think I will just get pushed aside like nothing again, and I think it'd be better for me to not rely on him. I can rely on myself instead; however, I can't help but have a thought at the back of my mind:Is this how a relationship should be? Yes, you're not supposed to lose yourself in a relationship, there's still supposed to be space between the two of you; however, aren't you supposed to at least be there for each other, listen to each other's woes or anything? I know I've been doing that for him to this day without a doubt, but am I robbing him of his chances, ""ruining"" what we have over being scared of opening up to him considering his track record? Am I being too overbearing? Am I being too clingy for wanting time with him, for wanting him to listen to me, to feel appreciated even though he's busy?

97382,"Prior to 2020, being a cabin crew was very sought after. But not many people know that actually there are a lot of foreign crews in Singapore Airline. I didn't know I have such a nationalistic sentiments prior to joining the airline. Out of my batch of 20, only 1/4 were Singaporeans. I felt like I was in a foreign land when I was in class. Majority of them are very nice people but a few of them did make unnecessary remarks while I was there. I remembered that there was one Malaysian trainee who announced to the whole class that she was only using Singapore as a stepping stone, so she can live and work in Europe next time. Fast forward many years, she is now married with kids in Singapore to a local. I guess Singapore has something better to offer to her than Europe after all. My trainer back then was a Malaysian born. She prefers Malaysian because she felt that they were more committed to the airline and had stayed longer. I felt that she could have kept the comment to herself even if the comment might be true base on her observation. The company rationale for hiring foreigners are such that there will be a local speaking crew in every flight. So if the plane is flying to Japan, there should be a Japanese speaking crew. So hiring of foreigners are not due to being anti-Singaporeans but there is a real business need. But I really wonder how many % of the crews are foreigners. And for promotion, would nationality be an important criteria for consideration? And if there are more foreigners being promoted, and people tends to be bias to people of their own nationality, would the culture be more favourable to foreigners in the long run.-#97382: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97382",['Like: 37 people'],17 comments,7 shares
97381,"I have been with my boyfriend for close to 4 years now. Things were going great at the start, we would be able to talk about our feelings and compromise together. However, at the mid mark of this relationship, he gets very short tempered now and does not try to talk things out when we have disagreements. I have been very understanding and patient with him especially when he is in NS now. We hardly have time to talk because he is always tired (he is in ST) whenever he dismount too. He would take naps during his breaks and we hardly even have a 10 min conversation daily. Sometimes when he is upset, he would cancel our plans and make plans with his friends instead. He will also game whenever he is out with his friends and hardly makes time for me. He knows that I feel neglected but does not make time for me but rather make plans with his friends only and tell me the only day he is free and I will make to adjust my own plans so that I can meet him on his ‘free’ day. Telling him how I feel does not make things better. He will always be rude to me and call me names because he gets irritated easily. He will ask me to shut up or resort to blocking me too. I do not know what to do. I feel like he does not appreciate me even when I have been so understanding and patient with him. What should I do?

I am a sensitive person and may overthink like maybe two weeks of less conversation as compared to usual long chats, I would wonder is it his interest is fading. He assured me on the times I would prompt him my doubts (like twice), that he is still interested and how busy his work is. What surprises me is, during an occasion when I didn't display my doubts, he still assures me. I am quite interested in him because I realize that during the day whenever I came across something interesting, sad or happy I would want to send him, but of course at times I will hold back because I do not want to disturb his busy work. And yes, he told me before it's fine to text him like spam or a bunch because he will reply when he's more free. I am a simple person, what should I do?

97372,"Hi all(kind souls on the net), need some help with insurance matters.My mom went for a type of heart surgery(balloon angioplasty) some time back and I just found out that her insurance company denied the hospital claims saying that she has got heart disease before. But the thing is she never had any Doctors told her she’s got any heart diseases before the surgery took place? It’s the first time anyone even told her she has got heart disease before and it’s the insurance agent. The Insurance Agent said she went to check with the hospital for my mom’s health records and told her that her hospital claim for the surgery was not possible because of her prior health records. Only simple verbal conversations to tell her it’s a no-go and the case is done. How is this allowed and possible? My mom herself went to the hospital to dig for her records too to want to find out more but was only given some charts that only Doctors can read and understand. There are no written reports to state if she have had any heart related diseases before. Now she has to pay for the full amount of hospital fees despite being insured with relevant insurance policies. So she’s been paying all these years to the insurance company for nothing? I’m ready to call up/visit the hospital to ask for more reports for proof. Please let me know what I can do to help her. She’s very stressed out but did not want to burden me that’s why I only just found out about this by accident.

97353,"TLDR - how to move on from a guy?I posted awhile back and the background story is that I met this guy (M) 2 months ago through an event. He's basically a very nice person, teased me a lot, would go out of his way to help me and slides into my DM from time to time. I might have feelings for him cos I feel like we click well tgt and have been thinking about him almost everyday. He's 3 years younger than me and I don't even see him everyday. I saw the comments, telling me to give M a try because age shouldn't matter as feelings would matter more. I thought about the whole situation logically and I do realized that the age doesn't matter anymore but when I weigh out the pros and cons of chasing him, more cons appeared I realized he might just be flirting with me cos I'm someone new in the team and now that time has past, we are getting further and further away. The both of us are at different stages in life (I'm a fresh grad while he is still in studying in ite) and dating would seem hard at this point. Although it's possible to text him everyday, but I don't think it would work out in a long run if our feelings are not mutual. Plus, I don't think I'm pretty enough or even good enough for him...My friends mentioned that this would just be an affection and I would get over it soon but it's alot harder than I thought......

We chatted via whatsapp for about a week and found that we click pretty well. He soon asked me out and we will be meeting for dinner in a few day’s time. The problem is this, I just found out by chance about his very recent pics from other sources. Tbh, I was surprised and disappointed at the same time about how he looked. We exchanged ig and I saw that his dating app pics were taken 2-3 years back. His ig has not been updated regularly since then and most of his pics were of scenery and group pics where his face is too small to be seen. While he looked cute and vibrant back then, his face has become much rounder, his hair has thinned and he aged quite a fair bit. He’s a high achiever at work and I think it might be his job stresses that cause him to age but still I’m really disappointed. If he has used his current pics, I’d have passed him over srsly.

I’m happy to just stay in the sidelines and continue to be that good friend to her. But one thing that’s been bugging me is that I became more and more aware that her boyfriend is not exactly what he seems over time. It’s not like he committed any grave acts, but it’s multiple small things that I find questionable - just a few egs. 1. My friend is devout in her religion and only wants a bf that truly believes in the same. Although he tells her he believes, and accompanies her to her gatherings all the time, there are just signs that he doesn’t truly believe that myself and a select few others have noticed. 2. My friend feels strongly against porn. Her bf watches porn all the time but she is not aware as he keeps quiet about it. His mentality is what she doesn’t know wouldn’t hurt her?? 3. One of my friends knows his ex gf, and whilst he doesnt show it obviously, he is quite money minded, based on what was told to me at the very least. One of the reasons they (he and ex) broke up was because he couldn’t see a comfortable future with her and constantly brings up comments about this every now and then about how she needs to work harder in uni since her family isn’t well off, which the ex couldn’t take any more - and concurrently, was confiding in her close friends about her issues with him (who were both male), and then broke up with him eventually. But he now cites that they’ve broken up because she was interested in one of her male close friend? This friend of mine comes from a wealthy family and I don’t want her to be made used of, even indirectly. I think the question I’ve got is, should I tell her these small things or not? What’s holding me back is I do not wish to ruin our long-standing friendship, and if she believes him instead of me, I’ll probably never see her again. Furthermore, I don’t want her to get the impression like I’m making these comments because i used to have feelings for her (which she knows) and that I am trying to ruin their relationship. I’ve thought about just leaving things be for quite a few months now but it’s starting to bother me more as they are potentially planning for a wedding early next year. I don’t want my friend to find out about all this after she gets married but at the same time I risk losing a friendship I really care about with her still potentially proceeding on and then finding out this crap is true later.

At first I was very supportive, did everything I could in my power to help him; constantly being there for him, driving all the way to his house to pick him up, bringing him out just so to lift up his mood and so much more. He did go for therapy. He was under medication but even then, he was constantly down, always had depressive & suicidal thoughts. Eventually, I decided enough was enough. I am not here to treat him to become better. I am not his therapist, I am his girlfriend. I had to take care of my own mental health as it was taking a huge toll on my health and so, I broke up with him. He threatened that he was going to commit suicide, called me names, kept pestering but I did not budge. If he had wanted to kill himself, he wouldn’t have threatened me. Anyway, after I left him, I finally felt a huge relief. I was so much happier, I worked on myself and became a much happier person.

Initially when we got together, we would try to do all things together and spend times together. But recently because he needed to study for his exam so he stopped seeing me, and the only time we would talk is during the night time before we sleep, for only around 10 minutes. Usually if there’s nothing important, he wouldn’t message me during the day time also, I was told by him not to message him so often as it will distract him from studying. Recently things got worse when we fought over the phone, we patched things up after that, but within a week he broke my heart and told me that “I didn’t have the mood to see you now cause I really need the time to study.” But I merely need 10 mins of his time, and I am suggesting to go to his place instead of asking him to come over. I asked around my friends who got a bf/gf and they all said they would always make time for each other, and their frequency of meet up is at least once per week, while I didn’t even get to see him till his exam is over. And before that, our meeting is once every two week (after the honeymoon phase). I already told him that I don’t mind going to somewhere near him to meet him, and I only need 2 hours of his time per week and I still don’t understand why he can’t make time for me. I still like him very much but I couldn’t do this anyone, so I told him over the phone last night that we are not compatible for each other and we should break up, and I am sorry that I break up with him one month before his exam, and I hope he is not too emotional influenced by that. I initially wanted to break up with him after his exam, but few days ago he messaged me and told me that he wanted to get married with me, while I at that stage, is planning for a break up. So I decided that I should not drag it any longer.

My doctor cried when i told her what i went through and how i feel it affects me even in adulthood, and frankly, i felt quite pathetic and damaged. Certain Triggers will cause me to go into attack mode where i may lash out or be physically violent if cornered due to some traumatic experiences in the past. I spent a goood portion of my life trying to build everything back up and face my inner demons and for once, i feel as though, i managed to get a stable footing.My bf is from a happy stable family. Everytime we fight, i have told him multiple times (100x) to just give in to me, hong me and if need be discusd another time where i have cooled off. I also requested that he does not do my triggers that will cause me to feel frightened and act out.Yet he fails to. Recently, our fights have escalated to violent scuffles (he intimidates me, i act out when i feel threatened and he hits back violently). I recognise that this is not a healthy relationship anymore. Despite multiple talks on changes during fights, ie. I wanted him to be the bigger man and just give in when i am mad, so that things would not escalate, and talk about it when i have cooled off. I wanted him to stop saying paggro and hurtful stuff during fights. I wanted him to be understanding that not every fight, he has to make a point to me, even as i am there crying and pleading. I wanted him to keep promises to me and not be physically violent to me (even if i act out). He would kick chairs and tables when we argue because he is angry.He couldn't. He kept doing the same things that puts me in uncomfortable, hurt and painful positions. Other than this, he is perfectly ok and spoils me.I am at a loss as the bto payment date is upcoming. I have recognised that he is likely not the guy that can love and respect me (with all my baggages and pain) and probably is not emphathetic enough to my trauma. He doesn't want to cancel the house and wants to try and continue (tbh, he keeps changing his mind and im unsure what he really wants). He has called in to postpose the date to give us a longer runway. He has called into counselling hotlines upon my insistence but the violent tendencies is still there. He told me many times that he wishes to change so that we can have a future. But everytime things escalate, he goes back into the same actions. Longest he ever maintained a change was for 8 days. I find him very immature for his age in the sense that he always feels that he needs to argue and win, even as i tried bringing up things to him by stating that ""When you do this, it hurts me..."" etc etc. I cannot handle his defensiveness or need to argue, anymore. I recognise that i am not the normal girl like others and i am ""damaged"" in a way, despite me successfully hiding it on the surface. Yet i am pretty certain that this is not how i want to live my life. I do not wish to have my hard work, in trying to carve out a normal life as much as possible, to be down the drain. And for me to lapse back into depression.My friends are split, one camp feels that i shld think more on the longer runway, the other calls for immediate end now. Ultimately, the final decision is my call. Should i insist on the house termination since violence has occurred ? Or should i take time to reconsider upon this longer runway?I do love him, but i feel that a short term pain is better than a lifetime of abusive relationship, as i was in a abusive family and i do not wish to continue in a potentially abusive marriage.-#97295: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97295","['Like: 54 people', 'Sad: 35 people', 'Care: 31 people']",134 comments,23 shares

97289,"Hi all, I'm local female/27, looking to settle down with my PR boyfriend of 3 years. However, there were some issues with my beau being an Indian of India national and 8 years older, and I'm from a local Chinese family with traditional values. I met him on my first job and he was my tech lead at that time. He had a dad bod and rich Indian accent that is hard to understand, coupled with this cheekopek look - as if he is checking out every single angle of me, I was really disgusted with this pervert at that time. However, me being fresh out of uni with some fire in me to seek career growth and with some confidence in me from my list of suitors since uni time, I tried seducing him in hopes that I can have a smoother route up the corporate ladder. I eventually succeeded and we hooked up. Our relationship started off as a fwb thing to me but little did I know that it was actually true love to him, as we progressed I also started falling for him. While he is definitely a cheekopek when in bed with me, at every other time, standing beside the petite me, he is like my friendly dark brown teddy bear which I just feel so comfortable and so warm with. I had recently accepted his marriage proposal and I am now cohabiting with him at his rented condo which he is working to buy off as our love nest after our marriage. We should be able to do so comfortably with both our salaries. He is happy to settle down with me in SG, as he plans to bring his parents over and has no plans to return to India. The only concerns left now are the disapproving vibes from my traditional Chinese family and circles of friends, hope that my nus peeps here can give me some advice on how we can navigate this carefully as we start planning for our wedding.-#97289: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97289","['Haha: 93 people', 'Like: 60 people', 'Wow: 12 people']",159 comments,21 shares
97287,"I am a guy who is at the age where most of my friends are married or getting married.My gf of around 6 months is extremely clingy , and to be honest , I am not really serious about her.Our relationship started as a FWBShe was the one who initiated it by asking me out and told me she had a crush on meShe was also the one who asked me to be her bf officially, it was difficult to reject on the spot where it was in a proposal style setting, I figured it would do no harm.Sure, having a FWB is nice ,but I do not feel that she is someone I want to commit to, she just is not wife materialI do not see a future with her ,but she seems to think otherwiseHere are some of the things that I cannot accept about her.Sick quite often and would whine about it to get my attentionClumsy,cannot focus on work and tend to cause more trouble than workCannot be independent , is emotionally unstable and has an immature mindsetAlways out to validate our relationship and gets upset when I say that I am just not as into her.Likes to create drama on social mediaWants to do it very often and I cannot keep up. Has mental issues like depression and is stressful to handleWe also have a large age gap which I feel is causing a sort of generation gap where we are in different phases of lifeAnd to be honest, I do not think she would be able to earn her own keep in the near futureI realized she is clingy and tried to give her less attention to reject her, said that I would be busy building my career in the near future and might not have time for a relationship.But she only got more aggressive in trying to progress our relationship. She forces our relationship to progress,getting me gifts, constantly planning and paying for dates so I would accompany her , staying over at my place every day , I was feeling suffocated.I did not ask for all that and I did not need to pay for anything , but it was making me feel bad.She would probe me with questions like asking me what happens if she gets pregnant, and hinting for marriage She basically built her life around me and seem to have no lifeI tried to make her busy by talking her into getting a job, but she quit not long afterI managed to convince her that meeting up everyday is not right, and around once or twice a week would be plentyBut she started to twist the boundaries, we would only meet up twice a week, but she would try everything to involve meShe would ask to play online games with me, join my online meetings , video call me every day, every few hours....I am not sure if she is trying to play games, but she hinted that she might want to be in an open relationshipTo be honest, I do not exactly agree ,but I could not care less, she can do what she wants. However it might affect my reputation if my gf is seeing other men, its fine if we are FWB status, but not when we are official.All the little bits are starting to build up despite multiple talks to resolve conflictsI feel like I am being blackmailed to continue this relationship , but at the same time,there is nothing bad by staying around to get pampered all the time.All I need to do is humor her once in awhile, and even if we fought , things get resolved fast probably because she just wants to keep me around.I do not think we would last very long if this keeps up, but is it right for me to carry on enjoying the benefits while it lasts, while she lives her dream life with me? Its a win-win situationOr should I end it before it gets any deeper and free myself up for an actual relationship.Given her emotional instability,she might make a big deal out of it or fall into depression if I decide to breakup with her, it would be difficult to get off the stage. Should I risk getting drama in my life and losing all the benefits she is providing?-#97287: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97287","['Like: 33 people', 'Haha: 28 people', 'Angry: 15 people']",85 comments,25 shares

Yes, I think so. Maybe if I'm stronger in mind, I will be able to make it through. However, recently I have been thinking twice about applying for new corporate job because no matter what jobs I'm trying to apply, it feels like I'm self-sabotaging, giving all sorts of excuse to reject interviews. I think my previous job has really left such a great impact on me, and I just can't seem to be more positive in this job seeking. If I don't look for corporate jobs, my degree will be simply a waste and I have a study loan to pay.. Any kind soul can give me some advice as I'm really lost.. I have tried to look for sales jobs, HR jobs, marketing jobs, BD jobs.. But either I'm underqualified or I realized that's not what I want. I will constantly think, what if I join a company that has toxic environment again?  The process of joining-resigning is really exhausting.

But mostly because he's busy, if I want to be honest with myself lol. So he's a really nice person but he kept disappearing? We would be texting and halfway through, he'd let me know that he has to go perform an operation. Then he will not reply until 2 days later! I try to be understanding. Afterall, he did let me know that he'd be in the operation theatre but... for 2 days? Am I unreasonable if I hoped that after washing up he'd at least text to update me or continue our conversation? Usually after 2 days, he'd just start a new conversation, like ""Hi, how's your day today"" and when I ask about his, he will talk about his work as if it was something that happened days back. Not like, ""oh I just ended a 48 hour surgery"".Other than that, it's been going great. We had fun dates and we text and talk on the phone like normal couples. I haven't dated a doctor/surgeon before and I am wondering if I have underestimated how busy they are. Any medical students/ doctors/ surgeons or people in a relationship with one want to shed light on this? I'm still early in the relationship and if he is indeed being sketchy I won't want to continue this. If not, I would love to try to be more understanding towards him!

97269,"My gf always resorts to lies and false accusations to ""win"" whenver we argue. I have tried many times to tell her this is not only not constructive, it just creates new problems. However, just by telling her this will trigger her as in her mind, she must always ""win"" every fight. It is really exhausting for me. Some more these accusations being false, just hurt me deeply everytime. It really affects me badly.So if we disagree on anything, or if she said something offensive or hurtful to me, just me politely and factually stating this will result in a multi-hour or multi-day fight. I honestly do not understand how come she reacts like this and over the last thirty months together, have tried all kinds of ways to communicate with her, be it more nicely, more politely, different tone, whatever, but the result always the same. I won't even be able to get 1 single sentence in once she starts her rants which can easily become an hour long monologue of her yelling and repeating at me. I mean she won't even let me respond even if she ask me a question? I will say two words to respond and then she will talk louder over me. I will wait for her to rant for an hour, then try to get one sentence in, only for her to tell me I am rude by talking over her.Despite the above, she will gaslight me like crazy and tell me I have anger management issues, because I am upset at the above. I asked her not to gaslight me. She then told me I am a gaslighter and even said her only fault is getting together with me, all other faults are mine in the past thirty months. I said let's be reasonable, in any couple, if one belives in thirty months, that party has zero fault in every quarrel, surely that party is not being honest. She disagreed and repeats her rants in response.When we are not fighting she is a very nice and fun person but little things trigger her and she becomes the monster above. Since talking to her about this is a trigger in itself, it becomes a Catch-22 situation for me.How to handle?-#97269: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97269","['Like: 23 people', 'Haha: 7 people', 'Care: 4 people']",97 comments,11 shares

97257,"I am a 35/M and I went to a top secondary school and JC in Bishan.I grew up around teenagers who prided themselves on their academic performance, on their CCA performance, and believed strongly that they will become highly successful people in the future. I had 2 classmates in JC, now best friends, who told me that they will hit a million dollars in annual salary by the time they reach 35, both of whom went to Oxbridge. Every single straight-A type that I knew had this air of arrogance around them, because I truly believe that they believed that they were better than the rest of us, that they will unerringly turn out to be more successful than any of us.There was this girl I met in J1. She was a quiet girl who was from a neighborhood secondary school who happened to be in the same OG and class as I was. She was really timorous, really shy. She didn't have the best grades, and was notorious for skipping CCA. I was always confused by how nonchalant she was about schoolwork, how she always copies my homework, and how I have never once seen her studying. She eventually retained, and I lost contact with her.I was recently having coffee alone at a cafe. She was fiddling around with the POS system. I recognized her immediately because she looked exactly the same as she did in JC. She did her hair up the same way. I approached her to say hello, and she told a younger girl to make her a flat white, and she came to sit with me at my table. We started chatting about the old days, and I found out she got BCCC/B at A-levels, and did business at SMU. It also turns out that she owns the cafe, along with 13 other F&B establishments in Singapore and JB. Her share of the profits in 2018? 2.7 million. I was speechless for a while. Meanwhile my friends who went to Oxbridge, one of whom on a PSC scholarship, are now civil servants, both earning just a little between 10-15K a month. That's a good salary, but I was mediocre in JC (ABBC/A) and even I am earning more than 15K as a management consultant.We have created a system of flawed meritocracy where children are brought up believing that just because you are the best in school, you're always going to be best in life. The logic is flawed because being the best in school just means you're going to be ""good"" in life. In most cases, you're just as likely as anyone to become ""great."" If we think about it, kids become great in school because they understand the system well, and because there is generally a very clear methodology to become great. As long as you don't challenge the system, as long as you work within the ""rules,"" you'll come out on top. In the real world, there are several lines of work in which it is valuable to be able to work well within a system. The SAF for example. Probably explains why the word ""scholar"" always gets paired up with ""general"" in Singapore.I think we, as a nation, need more humility when we think that the best people in school deserve more praise than any other student. People are good at different things, and school, being able to follow instructions to the hilt, is just one thing.-#97257: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97257",['Like: 1.5K people'],300 comments,1.3K shares

So he asked if want to have another one, i rejected but he insisted to put give it to me. I reluctantly accepted. It was weird that he didn’t drink the wine at all but I didn’t think much because I have met him several times alone. Later I fainted without knowing.

After he pulled me to shower, I was so lost with the drug effect and confused of what was going home. But I really wanted to go home.

And my mum really liked him, even to the point of sewing him a towel for when he stays over. However, ever since she found our condom in my room (she search through my room every now and then), she hates my boyfriend because she knows i lost my virginity to him. I know I broke her trust so I talked to her about it and my boyfriend went to talk to them as well. And they said we can continue dating... but a few weeks later she changed her mind and say i can’t date him anymore and started making up excuses about why I can’t date him (rude, smokes, havent go army lol and many other ridiculous comments) to the point where she threatened kicking me out (she did kick me out eventually but brought me back in after my bf talked to her) and she said she never want to see him again. she also threated my education saying she won’t be my gurantor for my bank loan for uni if i continue dating him. my dad listens to my mum so he won’t be my gurantor as well. This has def put a strain on my relationship as we’re now dating secretly. My friends all love him and doesn’t think his rude just like what my mum says, he’s just on a quieter side and likes to use his hands while talking...

Thankfully there was always a group of friends who would adopt me into their cliques.Before I entered uni, I went through a little transformation (not plastic surgery) to make myself average looking. After which, many people including those who knew me earlier, complimented me for being prettier. Deep down, however, it remains hard for me to be more confident due to past incidents of being discriminated.I've had a number of guys confess to me since then. However, none of them was able to understand my insecurities and I was unable to explain it to them completely. These incidents seem so trivial when put in words, than when people experience such things themselves. Eventually, I decided to let these good guys go for fear that I would be a burden. People around me continue asking why I remain unattached despite being in my 20s. But I am not brave enough to take a step forward towards a better future.

97162,"Hi, looking for advice.I'm at a crossroads & idk how to proceed into the next part of my journey. I've worked in sales all my life so I'm used to high pay, flexible (actly long) hours. I like my current job, good at it, clients are happy with me usually. But recently company has undergone a lot of changes and team dynamics have changed. Manager has become toxic, we don't even talk anymore. When we do in official communications, she makes it a point to 'lose my face' & shame me in front of other ppl. Tldr: it's time for me to leave. R/s is beyond repair at this point. I have 2 job offers from 2 friends now who hold me in high regard and know what I'm capable of. One is IT sales. One is corporate sales. The problem is the IT sales job was offered to me before the guy who offered it to me ended up sleeping with me. It's nearing recruitment period and he's been trying to buy me a lot of gifts. Basic is abt $5-7/k (I forget, I was drunk) + handsome commissions although idk what the estimates are. Company is big and booming and has been able to take advantage of covid situation. However, when I looked at the website, I rly cannot figure out like what kind of IT service they provide so product knowledge curve is gna be steep for me. He was telling me I'd have to go out for dinners with clients. I guess the only uncomfortable part for me is the fact we slept tgt a few times. I don't even like him. We were just drunk, bored, and horny. I wish we didn't sleep tgt but can tell he will definitely take care of me. It's just that this can also go really badly and he pimps me out or sabotages my professional life bc of personal feelings. Anw... other job is a corporate sales job. Basic is $4.5k/mth with generous comms but only after first year. Product training provided. Currently, I'm getting $3k/mth basic so both options are still an upgrade. Average covid sales match my current job's pre-covid average sales. Current job has not been able to adapt in covid. Average is $100k comms/year. Best sales is $600k comms/year. Sick. Working environment is good. All male industry and except for my friend who offered me the job, the other men are married, but this friend and I are platonic.I'm in a dilemma bc pre covid I used to rake in $120k/annum as a fresh grad in my current job but since covid hit, I'm barely hitting 30% of that. Most months maybe only 15% of that. Sucks... If I leave, I have to pay $20k penalty fee for contract severance. The only reason I stayed in this job is cos I don't wna pay the severance fee but after finding these 2 jobs, I'm seriously considering switching. Should I take the IT sales job or the corporate sales job tho? Have to send in my resume in next few days.

97159,"Need advice here !Tldr - My boyfriend's sister doesn't quite like me, couldn't really pinpoint as to what I have done wrong for her to have such a reaction towards me.I've been dating this man for almost a year and a half now. He is honestly nothing but sweet to me and I couldn't ask for anything better. He is my first official relationship but I am not his first. Everything is good between the two of us except that I have a little fear of going to his house because... his older sister doesn't quite like me.Just to give a little more context, whenever I go over to his house, I would always greet everyone, of course, that includes his sister no less. I would always buy enough food over for everyone which includes his sister's boyfriend as well. However, I was constantly met with cold shoulder or just a ""mmm"" whenever I was over. When I was invited to my boyfriend's house for the first time, I figured maybe she was just being awkward with me granted that that was the first time we met. But even after a year in, no matter how hard I tried talking to her, she would best give me a two words reply, if my boyfriend isn't near me, it would be met with silence and she would just turn away and walk back to her room.Before you all think that it is probably her personality, I thought so as well. Until my boyfriend invited over some of his friends for his birthday celebration and I saw the stark difference in her treatment towards his friends and towards me. You can imagine my face of disbelief when I heard her cracking jokes with his friends.After that party, it really did bother me quite a bit. However, I didn't want to share it with my boyfriend because then he would definitely confront his sister on that, and I wouldn't want to make his sister hate me even more! So I decided to ask my boyfriend a little more about his sister and he revealed that she was quite close to his ex (my boyfriend dated her for close to 5 years). So then I thought, she must have really treated my boyfriend's ex as her own sister, which it is understandable why she was so hostile towards me, now that I have ""replaced"" that spot. It didn't help when I found out that his sister is still in contact with his ex. Considered that my boyfriend did not really break up with his ex on good terms, and she had attempted  to get back with him, maybe his sister is trying to help her out? I don't want to speculate too much but I am also not a confrontational person. I can't just go over and ask her why she didn't like me when she barely even want to acknowledge me. I have tried many other means such as buying her gifts during x'mas, gave her handwritten cards, baked cupcakes for her (she loves pastry). At this point, I am really running out of ideas on what I should do next. It's been a year and I still can't figure it out! Please, I really need advice. Not a troll post...

97133,"I am lost at what to do. I grew up in a toxic environment where I was physically, mentally and emotionally abused. My father is a narcissist who thinks the world must worship him. He used to make my siblings and I do things against our wish i.e. dancing stupidly in front of him or other worst things for his entertainment purposes. And we’d be bawling our eyes out to make him stop but he wouldn’t and eventually gets angry and slap hard across our faces and said things like “get out of the room, I hate to see your face”. It got worst when I reached my teenage years. I got slapped so hard I couldn’t hear properly on one ear, kicked while I was lying on the floor because I wouldn’t stop crying from his slaps, called my friends to ask my whereabouts because he didn’t trust my words, threatened to hire PI to watch my moves etc. The list is endless. All this happened while my mother was watching whom we classify as an enabler. She could’ve and had that power to stop him because I have seen how fierce she could get with him if she didn’t get what she wanted but she did not stop him from raising his hands and voice at us. It came to a point where sleeping soundly was so scary because I’ll never know when he’d budge in to scream at me startling me from my sleep. The side effects from it now is I startle whenever I hear voices suddenly with my back turned or if someone touches me. I am in my 30s now and never had a boyfriend because of all the manipulative things they have done to me and the trauma I went through. I was always seeking their validation and approval that I forgo my own happiness and they started taking advantage of my generosity such as my time and money. I did not realise how toxic they were until recently, something triggered that all the childhood experiences came flooding through and I remembered all of it like it happened yesterday. I am still living with them and planning to rent an apartment because I am extremely unhappy with them. Not just my parents but my siblings too. I’m no longer talking to any of them and it’s hell. I do talk to my mom like nothing happened but inside I am reeling. Now, the question is, how do go none contact when I move out? Has anyone done it? Singapore is so tiny, I might bump into them and my relatives and I wouldn’t know how to react. I hate my family so much, there is no more love but hatred for what they have done to me. So to invite them over to my house for prayers or gathering seems hypocritical and I do not want them appearing at my door suddenly. I am also afraid they would depend on my for money and try all ways to keep in touch with me. They are also manipulative and could cry on command that I am grateful and how could I do this to them (when I reduced the allowance by $100) when all my life I was scraping to buy my own clothes and paid for my own diploma and degree.

Despite having a loving family, a great girlfriend whom I love to bits and a good an healthy circle of friends, I find it really difficult to call it a day and head home. For instance after a good hangout/gathering/date I usually dread heading home and would ask to hang out later or head to the next social gathering. Is the need to feel constantly engaged/connected/wanted by others normal? Even for sleep-overs, I would usually like to stay up and chat instead of heading to bed - to the extent of sleep deprivation. Is there anybody else who feels the same way or does anyone know how to deal with this?-#97132: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97132","['Like: 17 people', 'Sad: 4 people', 'Care: 3 people']",20 comments,2 shares

97126,"TLDR; Do you think that Singapore has no more cards to play and is facing its decline? Lately, our news cycle seem to show that all that we are doing is to sit on the fence over the Sino-US conflict and about us welcoming Globalism as our way of life by sucking up whatever fart the west put out, in hopes to gain some from them through FTAs. (Think about those multiculturalism/ pro-immigration, environmentalism and feminism bullsh!t) Anyone agrees that SG will somehow turn into the likes of Taiwan someday, where people are underemployed everywhere due to the abundance of degree holders and diminishing job opportunities? Or we will simply turn into ""California""; a state filled with immigrants, disenfranchised locals who wants to leave and a very wide wage margin, albeit the creation of jobs by some foreigners? It appears that we are doomed when we lose our edge in several niche industries, influx of white collar immigrants that does not necessarily create jobs for Singaporeans and the resultant falling TFR.Please feel free to expand my list, but it seems like the following industries are failing:- Semiconductors was lost after CSM lost the race against the Taiwanese, Koreans and Japanese- Aviation industry due to covid or probably even to countries like Thailand and Philippines that can easily set up bigger ""hubs"" than Saletar- Marine industry to many other developing countries, due to its low skill barrier- Ports from the many emerging ones in China and probably even Thailand- O&G due to the push for all those environmental these, climate change that narratives- Biotech that never really took off despite the billions spent on biopolis-#97126: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97126","['Like: 36 people', 'Haha: 7 people']",37 comments,2 shares

97118,"Like any other morning, it made its way out from the tree to hunt for food. It was none other than the famous cobra by the nickname “Sneaky”. However, today was different from any other day. Sneaky heard the sound of an Arabic music. It then followed the direction of where the music was coming from. As Sneaky got closer to the source of the music, the image of a bulky and tanned man began to surface. He was none other than HE. He was dancing happily in tandem with the Arabic music. Suddenly, there was a loud growl in Sneaky’s stomach. Sneaky was feeling extremely hungry as he saw HE dancing and smiling to himself. Then, an idea materialised in Sneaky’s mind. It decided to carry out the idea in its mind.Sneaky was feeling puzzled. HE was an obvious Eastern Asian Man yet he dressed like Aladdin with an awfully looking moustache. To carry out its idea, Sneaky proceeded to join him in the dance by moving its head along with the HE’s dance movement. Seeing Sneaky was moving along with his dance movement, HE was filling with joy. He felt that he was finally  able to influence living things around him. Feeling confident that he was able to influence Sneaky further, he decided to do something more risky. He descended his lip till it was few inches away from the head of Sneaky and did several dance moves involving his lip in close distance with Sneaky. Little did he know about the sneaky idea in Sneaky.As HE lips inched closer, Sneaky sprang forward to bit HE’s lips. Upon making contact, Sneaky injected all the poison from his fangs into HE. HE was caught by surprised as his dance usually would mesmerise snakes and will not cause it to attack. HE’s vision turned blurry as he started to succumb to the effects of the poison. As he lied on the ground, he saw a figure moving towards him.It was the Princess, well known for her benevolent and kind heart. Slowly but yet meticulously, she moved HE’s head onto her lap. At this moment, HE had passed out and his lip had turned completely black, just like the colour of charcoal. She knew that if no antidote was given to him within half an hour, HE would die. Princess knew that her physician had an antidote which was able to treat any poison. However, to get back to the palace, it would take exactly half an hour too.

In my case, this girl did 90% of the same things you mentioned here. Only saying hi in the same module and when she needed help, calling and expecting that I pick up to hear her rant about her stuff. Saying things like ""oh if I knew you were going to SEP to this place earlier, I would have applied to go with you"" and ""I'm always here if you need me!"" but poof! Disappears when I drop in texts to check on her while on SEP, short answers to my reply on her ig stories, etc. The difference is that she was emotionally clingy and isn't a player per se, but just a popz kid hanging out with anyone else.I cut her off basically everywhere. We only have a finite amount of emotional energy so we should spend it most selectively. Helping others is fine but not letting other people leech infinitely.

97103,"I’d appreciate some thoughts on this issue I’m currently facing.Last year in June (when COVID-19 was at its peak), my friend got retrenched from her job and borrowed $500 from me because she was financially tight and needed money to pay off some bills. I did not think much into it at that time because 1) She’s a very good friend and 2) I’d help with whatever I can help with.She found a job in January 2021 and said that she could finally return me my $500. Fast forward to April 2021, she still has not returned the $500.I did not pressure her about returning the money last year because she was jobless and I did not want to add on to her stress. However, when I reminded her about returning the $500 in February and March, she told me to give her more time as she is financially tight. I don’t get it… she now has a job with stable income now but still unable to return me my $500. I even told her that she could pay pay bit by bit, maybe $50 or $100 at a time, whatever is within her means to pay the money back slowly. However, she told me she would prefer paying back the $500 at one shot. Here’s the funny thing, she claims she is financially tight, but on her instagram stories, I see that she goes out for meals almost everyday (btw, she dines at cafes and restaurants), having drinks at a pub almost every week. If she is not doing well financially, is this the kind of lifestyle she should be leading?I raised this concern of mine to a few friends who are in the same clique as us. Some of them agreed on my viewpoint but some of them just went..“Aiya, you come from a rich family, $500 is peanuts to you..why you being so calculative?” Yes, I admit I come from a well to do family however, I have never seen my parents money as my money. It’s theirs and theirs alone. What they decide to do with it has nothing to do with me. My parents worked hard to get to where they are now so I don’t see why I should be living off them. Besides, I work hard for my own things as well. It doesn’t matter if I’m rich or not. What matters here is integrity. If you borrow money, be it $2, $20 or $200, have the bloody integrity to pay back the money you owe. What should I do now? I’m kinda at my wits end chasing this friend to payback the $500. Should I just let it go or keep pressurising her to return the $500?-#97103: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97103","['Like: 43 people', 'Sad: 7 people', 'Care: 4 people']",16 comments,7 shares

She is the social kind of person, always hanging out with different groups of friends daily. She is also religious, actively participate in this chriatian association n goes to church weekly. She is staying at the school hostel n about a few weeks back she got really sick. For some reason she decided to tell me about it. Told her to go see a doctor but she refused saying that it was at night n if she didnt get better by morning she would go see a doctor. Me being a concerned friend decided to get her some hot food n medicine. I decided to drop the stuff at the lobby n go home after. When we met at the lobby, she told me to follow her to her room. Initially i didnt want to as her floor is for females but after she convinced me saying a lot of guys come there too, i decided to follow her. We ate the food in the pantry area then i asked her to eat the medicine that i bought. I also gave her vicks n a blanket as she told me she was cold. Wanted to leave afterwards but she asked me to hang around for a bit since she was lonely.  We ended up playing some games on the nintendo n watch a movie on netflix in her room. Halfway through the movie she told me that she was getting sleepy so i turned it off n got ready to leave. It was around 2am at this time. She told me to sleep there first as it was late at night n its dangerous to drive back since i was also sleepy. I wanted to sleep at the common area but she told me to stay with her.So i slept on the floor in her room using her yoga mat n a cushion. I plan to wake up early the next day n sneak out of her room b4 anyone saw me but because we were both tired, we woke up around 11. She checked if there was anyone outside b4 i left her room then i left. Bumped into this girl at the lift when i was leaving but didnt think too much about it. Fast forward 2 weeks, rumours began to spread that she slept around. She began to socialise less n avoid meeting up with me. This made me feel devastated as i dont have much friends n might have lost a really good one. I feel really useless now n angry at myself as im part of the reason for this. I really hope she can get over this n become friends again. She also hasnt replied my texts for a few days now.

97093,"Notice a lot of posts about sexual compatibility in a relationship. Cant help but notice the double standard in the comments. When a male confessor said that he has a higher sex drive, a lot of the comments will be like go pcc/diy to satisfy ur needs. When a female confessor said the same thing, the comments would be like sexual compatibility is impt in a relationship. As someone who has been in both sexual n non sexual relationships, here r my thoughts. I think that sex is just another activity that u do with ur partner. Its like playing sports or watching a movie together. If u both enjoy doing it then good for u. Theres no min or max amount of times u have to do it. If u have different sex drives, u dont necessarily need to find a new person. Try talking it out n see why they have a different sex drive level. Maybe u can also experiment with toys etc. Lots of stuff u can research about online. Compromise n communication is key. Also as mention earlier masturbation is also an option. Intimacy doesnt have to be just through sex, there r a lot of other ways to be intimate with ur partner.

97063,"#97022: https://www.NUSWhispers.com/confession/97022Hi All,Thank you so much for your kind comments. Thank you admin for posting my story. I took a deep breath before reading it and cried in tears of happiness (I definitely cried alot, haha). Firstly I would like to address that I did not blame my parents for anything. Back on those days, I just feel really stressful that they were pushing me to get something that are not in my capability but also because of their perseverance, I have gotten a local diploma in Accountancy. Which I am very thankful of for the rest of my life. This is my biggest achievement. I remembered before my dad went for heart surgery last year and he cried to my mom saying that he was so worried about me or my future. Back then after knowing it, I am surprise because he never let me know all these. I felt very unfilial because among my other siblings, he worried about me alot. But I don't understand why? After all I still earn a decent diploma salary ($1,900-$2K), just not as highly educated as my siblings and wealth off. But I know my limit, I never feel like I was earning very little because I don't splurge and I only need to fed myself after giving them allowance.I have been working for 8-9 years now. I am still frequently ask by interviewer or head of the higher rank on ""why didn't I go and pursue a degree?"". And every time this question was asked, I can't answer it. Because I don't have any excuses. I didn't even tried taking the course and know I failed or gotten expelled but at least I tried. I find it a waste of money to study and dropped out. In fact, the 10 years time frame for a 12 modules Advance RMIT accountancy is coming to an end soon. Which means that I have to take all 24 modules next time. Since I have saved more than enough, I am considering if I should just take part time degree and don't think too much already. I am not ready for my mental health issue but I can't let it drag me or delayed me if I want to achieve it. My mom continued to convince me to try. The only thing is my friends find that part time studying and working is very tiring and too much distraction. And studying accountancy is really hard for me. The last time I studied diploma in accountancy, my weight has gone down alot. I am overly worried about not able to understand or do well or even my increasing worsen anxiety which led to the hesitation for so many years. I actually had a childhood goal being an accounting lecturer/tutor in ITE because ITE Nitec was the lowest point of my life. But because diploma was too hard for me, I eventually didn't get to go into a local uni. (My perspective during that time when I could not get in is actually bitter sweet, I am happy I finally freed myself from this endless study and can start going out working but also I know I've disappoint my parents). If I graduated with a private degree, I could probably go there and applied to work. Since I don't last long working full time accounting office job once things get really bored. I don't really care about the salary, I just want to get back to help people in their lowest point of life just like how my ITE lecturer helped me. My lecturer was also a nitec student previously but graduate from NUS degree. ITE lecturer has their own criteria for entry so maybe private degree cannot get in also. I cannot put too much hope in this career.Personally I think way too much and ended up not taking any steps because of my fear. These 9 years I've been debating, should I do it? Should I not? I envied people graduating because behind that certification is endless of determination and hard work. But some of my friends closer to me knowing my situation has told me if you can't commit, don't take it. They know I've come a long way in the education path. While people over their 30s are getting married and BTO or already with kids, I am still thinking of petty stuff like taking a degree. I really hate myself. I didn't want this to become a regret for not trying but I hate putting myself in a situation whereby I ended up suffering tremendous stress just like how I did in my poly days. My dad wants me to be in good health and happy, so he stopped asking me to get a degree. He know I stop eating and cried frequently, once I get too stressful. While my mom feel like I should try 1 sems and see how it goes. What should I do? :((-#97063: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97063","['Care: 15 people', 'Like: 7 people', 'Sad: 3 people']",0 Comments,15 comments
97062,"(Admin please don’t filter this out) Hi guys,I am about to graduate from my overseas university international program (SIM-UOL). Based on last year, my seniors took more than 1 year to receive the certificate because of the covid situation in London. However, they did well for their previous (year 1 and year 2) modules and received before their final exam. On the other hand, I didn’t do well in my previous (year 1 and year 2) modules as I was coping school with part time job. I am wondering when do graduates in my similar position apply for their jobs? A. Do you wait for your exam results for your final year exam to be out before applying for jobs?B. Do you apply for jobs right after your final year exams (before the results are out)?C. Do you wait until you have received your degree certificate to apply for job?

97047,"I live 30 km away from my workplace and my job requires that I show up at 8.30 am or 9 am punctually. This requirement could be once or twice a week, or even three times, for about six months in a year. I am not an early riser and typically I get up at sunrise, and not earlier.  I'm single and live with my mum, and my aunt lives nearby and comes over for meals. Mum is still ok but now is starting to depend on me for more things. My aunt deliberately moved near us for a convenient arrangement. Taking the MRT is not an option as I can't wake up early enough. Changing jobs is not an option. My options are: 1) Taxi or PHV - the journey is 30 mins but sometimes I get stressed out when the vehicle takes too long to arrive, typically causing me to arrive minutes to spare before the starting time. PHV drivers have ever cancelled on me. 2) Buy a car and drive in the morning  - the driving is 30 mins but even entry-level models are expensive3) Show up the night before and sleep in office - I have a safari bed and sleeping bag at my workstation and access is via access card. Company has not said that I can't stay overnight. There are shower facilities as well. The disadvantage is that I need to have my access card with me if I go to the toilet or shower, i.e. consequences of forgetting that access card when going to pee is quite disastrous. 4) Rent a room 2-3 MRT stops away - this reduces my commute but the problem is getting my family to come to terms with this decision, due to the situation at home. Also, it is not everyday that I have to show up early to work. 5) Buy a flat 2-3 MRT stops away - this also reduces my commute, but gives me extra headache for renovation and similar problem with family accepting this decision. 6) Book a hotel room nearby whenever I need to - this is at least $100 per night for a room ...

97045,"I need to get this off my chest. Please don't filter.So recently, I met a semi deaf guy who was buying a pair of hearing aids as the previous seller that sold him ONE hearing aid sold him the most expensive piece he could afford. That bloody seller sold him just ONE piece when he needed TWO of it and told him to buy one side first, and when he saved up enough, he can go to him to buy the next side. LIKE SERIOUSLY? This type of money also good to earn? That poor deaf guy was working his ass off. I cannot believe there are seller like that. They are selling a necessity not a want item. How can they be so heartless? That poor guy is not even rich and he had to live with that stupid hearing aid that doesn't even help him at all for a few years. Imagine all the agony he had to live with. And wearing 1 hearing aid when he needed 2 is bad for his ear.Anyway, thank god he went to this brand (not here to promote the brand, so not going to mention the name), the consultant told ask him what is his budget and recommended him A PAIR that suits his budget and needs. Even though it was one of the cheapest pair, the consultant even spent time to slowly explain to him to the functions and what not. And even told him that there are hearing aids for all budgets. Doesn't mean the most expensive ones are the best. Guys, please spread the words, majority of the hearing aids consultants are salesman. They earn by commission. So if you happen to have a deaf relative or friend, please do get them to seek at least 2 opinions from different company before spending a bomb on hearing aids.-#97045: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97045","['Like: 181 people', 'Care: 33 people']",13 comments,34 shares
97044,"Need advice.  A frustrated graduate here. Was rejected by a role that I was pinning my hopes on.Failed around 6 government job interviews, including some that I was quite confident in (relevant skillset and experience). Some (HR, panel) were kind enough to let me know that other applicants are more experienced. Which is not surprising cos some did not pay much attention to me during the interview. But it seems that it is not my interviewing skills either - one was quite impressed with my enthusiasm. I wonder if other fresh grads are experiencing the same? Understand that market is very bad and I heard that some are not even getting interviews - in that aspect, is it safe to say that I am quite lucky...? I have some that are still pending, some that I have yet to attend. Sometimes, I think that it may be because of my written assessments. At times, I wonder if I am even fit for the role/govt as a whole cos the assessments are really daunting and I feel that I am not ""smart"" enough for them. I even question my worth, and wonder if I am even worthy enough to apply for the government.I am really very dejected at this point and wonder if I should stop applying for the government sector and focus my time on the private sector instead, or try out internships and traineeships. I even wonder if I should just take up any SME job that comes by but pays below 3000. It is a pity as I am genuinely interested in the government sector for my first job. At this rate, I may really be swallowed by the disappointment and tiredness from applying for government jobs that demanded for numerous intense assessments. The number of PSC application form that I have filled in was insane. It is really hitting my self-esteem.Background: I am from FASS, graduated with a second upper.-#97044: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97044","['Like: 43 people', 'Care: 10 people', 'Sad: 7 people']",37 comments,11 shares

97031,"The whole reason why a lot of Singaporeans still believe in the obligatory role of children as caregivers of their aging parents is a symptom of the hangover from our Chinese/Asian ancestry. The thing about culture is nobody actually questions it because we have all been raised to believe that all culture is sacrosanct. In fact, it’s not always the case. Cultures, like modern ideas of communism and capitalism, are just world views. Some of them make sense, most of them do not. There is nothing inherently valuable about preserving a particular culture. It might be useful to preserve specific values from many different cultures, but it makes no sense that the entirety of any culture can be said to be always good. At one point of time, slavery was a societal norm of a large group of people. At one point of time we had to live in fear of tyranny from imperialists. At one point of time, communism had resulted in the greatest event of starvation in the history of mankind. These are all cultures, and if we want to choose to deny the bad and only invite the good, then what’s the point in being a follower of a single culture if you’re just going to re-define it as you go? Isn’t it far more helpful to free your mind from the dogma of tradition and to make moral judgements about your actions based on modern definitions of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?Even though Singaporeans are generally well-educated, fundamentalism is rather rampant. If we were to abide strictly by the dictates of our Chinese culture, then we will find ourselves also believing in rather backward views about human rights. Gender inequality is massively problematic in Chinese culture. Many of our practices are also based not only on core Confucian values, but also of a complete lack of understanding of the scientific method. i.e A large number of us still believe Daoism is literally true. If we can’t get ourselves to question the wrongs in our cultures, how can we ever hope to progress as a country?-#97031: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97031",['Like: 51 people'],39 comments,5 shares
97024,"Sharing some rs advice here that I'd wish I had known before.My bf and I are in long-term stable rs. In the initial phase of our rs, I initiated breakup few times cause I couldn't manage my emotions well and also had lots of insecurities. But he always pulled me back into the rs. Until one period he could not take the damage of my words and emotions that he said if I want to, we can. That was a wake-up call for me because I didn't want to lose him, I just did not know how to sit with the agony when things got rough and cowardly sought escape. After that, I never initiated. I constantly told myself, if this rs is important enough to me, I will not choose the ""easy"" way out.Fast forward to today, I still have some emotional issues and there are also some fundamental issues in our rs which is taking awhile to sort out. Few times, our arguments got so bad that he initiated breakup but relented after I promised to see a therapist. Thing is, I did not expect the act of initiating breakup can be so damaging to the rs and parties involved, until I got on the receiving end myself. So damaging that, even weeks after, I have repeated nightmares of him breaking up with me. I wake up shocked, I wake up crying, I wake up feeling so insecure and miserable sometimes. But I had to sit with the agony, because some part of me feels that I brought it upon myself. I started this whole breakup shit. I do hope seeing my therapist would help with this. And sometimes I wonder what unseen damage have I done to him back then, and I really hope he heals from it.The message I want to bring across is, initiating breakup, for whatever reason, is so damaging and you won't realize it until it's too late. At the point of bursting with frustration and helplessness, you may think, it's just few words. Let's see where it gets us. Maybe he/she will give in. Maybe he/she will feel sorry. Maybe I will feel better. But trust me, even if it seems to work for one or few times, it does long-term, permanent damage that you'd wish you had shut your mouth then. What worked for me, and I hope it works for you if you get into such a situation is, tell yourself to wait one day. Just wait. Exit the situation if you can't stand the atmosphere - tell him/her you need some space, go to another room, go grab Macs or just go do whatever you like. And if you still want to initiate breakup after one day, then have the conversation.And to anyone who hurt so bad from breakups or near-breakups, I hope you heal from it, however long it may take.-#97024: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97024","['Like: 113 people', 'Care: 25 people']",6 comments,22 shares
97022,"Never tried using this platform before but I want to share out my problem lingering for years. Hopefully admin can help me post this so I can get advice.Since young I've never excel in studies. I am always the student in the last class since young, I always find myself crying for lesson on the start of new school getting so stress up to try to cope with lesson, piles of difficult homework. When I bought my homework back home, my parents are unable to help me too because they are illiterate. Our family are not wealthy so despite my bad grades since young they will still opt for me to go home tuition or group tuition at CDAC. Eventually I still didn't get to do well and went to ITE Nitec. When I was signed up for ITE Nitec, I begged my parents not to let me continue study. Of course they didn't listen because a kid this young with only N level certificate cannot survive well in this society. I still cried every time I am in a new school, restless, unable to sleep, depressed which seems unusual as this symptom continued. Eventually I finished my ITE Nitec and was offered a Higher Nitec with the help of my home tuition and a good CCA, GPA 3.5 in total I was offered to get inside a well-known full time polytechnic. My parents was elated but for me it is just many stressful and crying days ahead. I've never love studying because I find myself struggling so much learning new things with poor understanding. Even with the help of home tutoring, I failed common test and module back in my poly days. At one point I wanted to give up. I won't be able to get inside this poly and finish this if not for my parent's perseverance. In the end, my grades wasn't good but I still passed.Afterward my parents frequently want me to go for a degree since I can take the advanced RMIT. Back in those days I've taken toll in my health. I had panic attack and forced myself to sleep during my younger days. My heart beat so fast that I didn't know what is wrong with me. I suffered from my 2nd panic attack back in my ITE days, total blackout in my eyes. I remember not having any breakfast every morning and crying secretly behind that smiling face just to hide my unhappiness. I often came back to school sitting at the corner of my room, just sat there thinking how to break the chain of studying and studying. Is life really about certificate? And without degree the job interviewer always feel like you've not completed your study pathway. Not everyone can do a degree some people just don't have the ability to, some are just not smart enough or even not strong enough to persevere their education after failing module after module. This time round my mother encouraged me to go for a try to get a degree while my dad knows how much I suffered and is satisfied that I have a diploma at least. I know how all these torment are going to come back to me again. Thankfully I did not suffered all these symptom/phobia when it comes to work. I've also not touch any books after my last graduation for many years. What should I do?  Do you have a degree? And is it not ok to not have a degree in life?Do you guys suffer these mentally like me in your study pathway?

97021,"It is hard to write this but here goes. I am currently 25 (M), and I am a 2nd year undergraduate. My relationship with my dad has been one of the hardest since childhood. Since young, he has been very controlling and strict. I remembered that I was not even allowed to touch the computer unless it is for official school purposes, much less go out of my house to hang out with my friends. I believe my anxiety disorder and depression came from him ( I am in a much better place now, though I would still get these occasional symptoms from time to time). Things escalated when I was in secondary 3 and I often fought with him, to the point that he would call the police on me and settle the dispute. My dad and I have never ever spoken to each other, and he passed away when I was 18 during my poly common test period. I felt really empty with no emotions when he passed away, and it feels like I am a heartless person, even till this day. So I was in a relationship with this girl for 3 years who I met from my poly days. We started dating during my last year in poly. But things started to get rocky during the last 6 months of our relationship. I could start to feel the distance between me and her getting wider and I really tried to salvage the relationship but to no avail. It came to a point one day when we finally sat down and talk and she told me that a guy who she met in SIT had treated her really well in school and she feels tired of me. Obviously when I heard that I flared out at her (my mistake) and things ended really badly from there.Sometimes I would feel that my life has been really shitty and could never erase it. I try to live to the fullest every day but I would still feel this void in me.

97002,"During my freshman year, I attended an orientation camp and met my facilitator, a girl, who was one year my senior. I eventually fell in love with her after the camp and asked her out individually as ""friends"". However, I'm not sure if I was being ""friendzoned"" or gaslighted for almost 3 years. 1-2 times a week, we would go out, watch movies, and have dinners with just the two of us. So we went out at least once every week to just go out and talk and play. But we didn't have any skinship at all and were moving really slowly. Texts were not often, although I texted her good morning every day. We just kept going out and things didn't really progress officially beyond friends- no hand holding, kissing etc. As I'm quite shy, I asked her if she minded getting the couple seat at Cathay. She said she's ok with it, so I got it, thinking that may be a chance to hold her hand or something. However, when I try to sit close to her in the cinema, she kept moving away. I respected her boundaries and just sat apart as well. I would send her back after every ""date"" although she lives in the West and I live in the East. It takes 2 hours to commute back via MRT/Bus. So we just kept going out for meals/movies/outings at least once every week for almost 1 year? I was perplexed so I texted her a long message asking if we were ""dating"", and she said that she treated me as a friend! Like wtf who goes out one-on-one like that and text ""good morning"" everyday to a friend? Despite that, I continued on for another year as a ""friend"" who keeps going out with her alone at least 1 time per week. I even took a Korean class (which killed my GPA btw) with her to meet her more often than 1 to 2 times a week. This is because she said that she is too busy with her CCA (she's in dance) and can't meet so often. Then I realised every Valentines' Day, she will get at least 1-2 ""confessions"" from other guys. One of them happened in the very same Korean class that I was in with her, and in the confession that guy said that she spoke to him often every night to confide in him? She denied it and said that I was being very toxic when I asked if she really did speak to this guy often at night. She said she simply treated that guy as a ""friend""?!So I took a break from her and started dating other people. After that, when she started working as an auditor, she said she's very busy and can't spare more than one night per week with me. I said ok. So around 1-2 times per week, I would go all the way to her condo in the West to play basketball/table tennis with her, or would go cycling. Then take the 2 hour train ride all the way home. After almost a year of doing this, I asked her if we were ""dating"" again, and she said we weren't, and that she was treating me as a ""friend""? I'm so confused. Is she leading me on on purpose? Did she ever like me? Which girl has so much free time to waste my time like this? It's almost 3 years of going out 1-2 times weekly alone, with no skinship.-#97002: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97002","['Haha: 71 people', 'Like: 59 people', 'Sad: 17 people']",203 comments,80 shares

Thanks for being my favourite person and best friend while we were still together. I still miss seeing your name pop up on my handphone screen, sending you milk & mocha bear instagram posts that reminds me of us, holding your hand and you being the first person I think of when I come across anything fun and exciting that we could do together.I don't know when cracks started to appear in our relationship. It might have been my own insecurity, the fear of losing you (irrational I know) that caused me to push you away. When you told me that marriage was just a formality, I felt my heart break because for me, marriage meant a lifetime commitment of weathering the highs and lows while still keeping our vows of ""till death do us part"". We once talked about couples and their ""honeymoon period"" and you said that you didn't believe in that because doing nice things for each other should be consistent in a relationship. But along the way, I started to fade into the background for you as you became more cold and critical towards me. Your friends became people whom you prioritised over me and whose opinions mattered more than mine.I knew that it was towards the end of our relationship on our anniversary celebration when you didn't sound too thrilled when I asked you how you felt about our 1 year relationship. When I asked you what you were looking for in a partner, you didn't want somebody who would build their life around you as you felt that it was too heavy for you to carry that burden. She would have to carry her weight financially in terms of equal contribution and you didn't want someone who was just a ""flower vase"" - looks pretty with no substance and she would have to have own passion and ambition. You were also looking for someone who could integrate well into your circle of friends. It took me by surprise because I never knew that you had such a checklist and that added additional pressure to what I was ""expected"" to be (being an introvert, not very career-minded & earning less than half of your salary) loved and accepted by you. I was hurt when you said that you didn't know that celebrating our anniversary was that special that it required a gift after I passed you mine. That night, my heart shattered from all the doubts, uncertainty and anxiety that accumulated from all our disagreements,  differences and feelings of being unappreciated & unloved. I felt that I wasn't ""good enough"" for you and knew that I needed a way out to love myself more. Even after all that has happened, I'm grateful that I had you in my life for that short period of time. It taught me more about myself, helped me to see my blindspots, and to grow. I've learnt that some fights are not worth affecting your relationship for and sometimes being kind is more important than being right. Although we are in different seasons of our lives and no longer in contact, I hope that you will be able to find your better half whom you will love and cherish and in return, do the same for you, always and forever. I will also try my best to get over and forget you even though it still hurts.-#96992: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96992","['Like: 26 people', 'Care: 16 people', 'Love: 3 people']",4 comments,2 shares
96987,"Hello! Just wanted to get some perspectives from everyone. I really like this guy that I’ve known for a while now, but I’m not sure how to further progress this relationship. We are both busy freelancers and are very career-driven. When I confessed and asked if we could take things a step further, he did mentioned that he likes me, but he wants to focus on his career. Initially, I felt that this might just be his way of rejecting me for fear that I would be hurt, but I realised that he’s genuinely busy. He would still make the time to talk to me whenever he can. Thing is... I don’t mind waiting, cause I’m not in a rush to get married or anything. I just want to know if he’s really interested in me. Say we give it 2 years, would things work out then? I don’t know if I’m lying to myself and should I give up? I think it’s really a pity if he cannot commit solely cause of his priority at this moment. We have a lot of common interests and his personality and charisma is everything I want in a relationship. But of course, I don’t want to lie to myself/waste time if he’s not interested in me. What should I do? Any advice is great appreciated. Thanks!-#96987: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96987",['Like: 2 people'],0 Comments,3 comments

And I can’t turn off the idea that it’s exchanging of fluids. I’ve spoken to my friends about it but they’re also not sure how to advise me on it. So I’m turning to you guys for help.

96982,"The ongoing debate on giving your parents allowance is interesting. Personally, I plan on giving a portion of my salary to my parents when I start working. But this isn’t out of tradition, rather because my family isn’t well off and when I start working they would still be paying for my siblings. So I hope to relieve some of their burden. Upon reflecting, I can’t help but wonder if I would still expect my kids to give me allowance when I retire. My parents had a late start, and hence I’m not too confident in their retirement. But as a privileged Singaporean kid who has a good education and studies in NUS I do expect to have enough savings for retirement if all goes well (if it doesn’t then I guess the CPF scheme is pretty flawed). In that case then I’d think I’d rather have my freshly graduated kids save their money to kickstart their adult lives. I sure can relate as to how difficult adulting is going to be and as a parent if I could lessen their suffering then I’d be happy.-#96982: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96982",['Like: 10 people'],0 Comments,0 Shares

It’s one thing if he is earning ALOT more than you, but if you’re both earning a similar fresh grad pay or if he is earning less than do you still need him to give you allowance?For boomers sure, when wives stayed at home and didnt work or when traditional household roles were in place and women were in charge of groceries and taking care of kids. But if both genders have similar income and both genders put in equal effort for the family, do you not feel guilty for receiving household allowance?Some may argue that it’s a symbol of love and you wouldn’t touch the money anyway.

96977,"#realquestion I've been together with my boyfriend for nearly one and a half years. We met during orientation and thing went on smoothly afterwards. My boyfriend was kinda sweet to me in the beginning when we were dating. He would usually shower me with gifts and take me out to eat good and delicious food, which I really enjoy.But anyway, after we got together officially in the 2nd semester, we started to stay over at each other's hostel room (thankfully we were both staying in single rooms at that time). I would say that things started to be more intense afterwards. He would start to introduce me to some adult films and we would watch it together, especially during Friday nights since we don't have school on Saturday. He would ask me to try out certain sexual positions while watching those films. I'm definitely new to it but I do love these intense actions and what he's doing to me. Furthermore, it's usually on Friday nights so not many people are in the hostel so we can be slightly noisy a bit.However, recently, I'm kind of feeling very drained as we are spending nearly 4 to 5 hours every week having ""netflix and chill"" sessions and I can't study during this period of time. Have talked to him about us toning down a bit and waiting for things to progress slowly but he really likes the thrill and the fun, and boys being boys, sometimes we just want to satisfy our needs. He have asked me to apply to stay together in the same room but I told him I will consider again (the reason I gave was because I stay at Clementi and I can save cost by not staying in hall) but he says he really wants us to stay together so that we can continue our relationship.Should I apply to be his roommate in the new semester?

96969,"Please don’t filter this out as it is a genuine query. ???? I’m just wondering how frequent do couples ‘normally’ have sex. For me, I would want it at least once a week, I don’t even mind doing it everyday. However, my partner thinks that even once a week is too much for him. He can make do without it. If not for me, I think he can go about without doing it for a month or so. Am I asking for too much? Is there any way to resolve this? I have spoken to him about and him being a great partner he tries to give it to me once a week nowadays. The thing is , it’s just different as in the way we engage it in, it feels a lot like he is just giving it to me because I want it and not because he wants it or is really in the mood. This kills my mood as well and I ended up not wanting it either. ???? It wasn’t like this in the initial phase of our relationship, he will always be the one to initiate it and the way he initiates it makes me feel wanted and ‘attractive’. I’m beginning to feel unattractive to him.   Will this be a potential problem if we get married. ????

96959,"Admin please don't block this. I am probably going to get roasted but I hope people can still have a healthy discussion around the topic. I probably have a wrong understanding of the whole issue so I appreciate any help in helping me fixing my views.I have too main issues. 1) I am starting to find it really difficult and tiring to be in a relationship with a feminist. 2) After being with a feminist, I am confused and really wondering what exactly is feminism anyway.Don't get me wrong. I am all for woman empowerment. I am not perfect by any means. I was a chauvinist before going into this relationship and maybe I still am now, I don't know honestly. This might be a long post.I used to be a typical chauvinist. I did have certain ideas on how woman should behave, dress and interact with people. I always thought that I would only marry a beautiful and hot girl. Then, I met my current girlfriend. She was really funny and always full of energy. She was not pretty by normal standards but I did enjoy being with her so I thought I would give it a shot. She told me that my so-called ""selling"" point was that I was kind and caring. I loved to do volunteer work and help people, especially elderly, to make other's live better. I knew that she was a feminist. I told her clearly that I might have some chauvinistic views due to my upbringing and environment but I am willing to change my views. I did not want to make her feel as though she is treated unfairly or in any manner that would hurt her feelings. She agreed to take the leap of faith together and we started dating. It was going well when the cracks slowly started appearing.The problem started with clothes. I had no issues with her clothes until one day, she wore a really short fbt which was showing a little too much. I told her that it is too short and that it is showing inappropriately but she said that it is her right to wear what she wants. Ok, I apologized and backed off. Next, we were having dinner outside when I could see her bra strap showing. In my family, my parents would ask my sister to adjust their clothes if their bra straps showed and it is deemed as embarrassing. I told my gf that her strap was showing and she gave a lengthy explanation. Ok, I backed off again. So basically, I have no say in her clothes which is fine. We had gone on a overseas trip together before covid. There was this street to our hotel that had a lot of shady looking men. We walked through the street with no issues when my gf was wearing normal jeans and t-shirt. It was creepy but we did not feel any danger. Then, one night, my gf wore this skimpy outfit and we had to walk through the street. Everyone was staring at her, like literally staring without flinching. It was super scary. At that point of time, the safety of my gf was the most important thing to me. I instinctively took my sweater and covered her while quickly rushing off. Yes, I would have thrown my life to protect my gf but I might have only taken 1 or 2 guys down with me. There were at least 10 of them and they might even have had weapons. Back in the hotel, my gf scolded me like crazy for covering her. I was only prioritizing her safety. It seemed so unfair to me. At my brother's wedding, she decided to wear something very skimpy as well. Everyone was looking at her. A lot of them were looking at her inappropriately. It made me so uncomfortable and it was so annoying. I could not say anything because she would create a scene and I did not want to ruin my brother's wedding. I could not ask people to not look at her because again, my brother's wedding. I am fine with her wearing whatever she wants but she needs wear it at the appropriate place right? Am I wrong here to feel annoyed? I should wear boxers or just my underwear to her sister's wedding when it takes place.So if she decides to run around nude, I am just suppose to watch that happen without saying anything?Next issue. I can't help it ok. I like to look at pretty girls. Unfortunately, if a pretty girl walks past me, I tend to look at them. It is not something I do consciously. This ""chauvinistic"" and ""superficial"" action of looking at beautiful girls gets me into trouble with my gf all the time. I really put in effort to ignore but when I am really tired and in auto mode, my eyes just move on their own. I mean all the guys look at beautiful girls right? Sometimes I wish I can just pluck out my eyes so that I don't have to deal with this issue.Next issue, her constant nitpicking. I already told her that I had chauvinistic views but am willing to change. Every time, I say something chauvinistic, she blows it up into a huge fight where it ends up with me having to run after her or go to her house in the middle of the night or fights that lasts for days and sometimes weeks. I mean if I said something wrong, she could just correct me and explain to me.  I already said that I am willing to change. Now, I am very careful with what I say to her. I have to constantly think before I say anything, literally anything. If I offer to crack the crab shell, she might think that I think that she cannot crack the shell herself. Even if she is struggling, I can't say it because she will think that I think that she is not capable of overcoming it. I have to constantly tip toe around her and I feel like I am in a minefield. I just need to say 1, just 1 wrong word and it is just explosions all around.Then, sometimes, she would complain that I am not offering help. Then, I am like ""WHAT THE $&%?"". We had a few friends that are mutual. One time, one of the mutual friend got into an argument with her. I stepped in to help her and protect her. Then, she started exploding in my face saying that I am chauvinistic. Ok, then, I ****ing backed off. We had another similar incident again with someone else but this time I just watched while eating my char kway teoy, slurping every bite. Then, she complained that I did not back her up. What the *&#! am I supposed to do? After seeing her contradictory actions, I am really starting to wonder what is feminism anyway? Isn't feminism just being treated equally?I asked her since she wants to be treated equally, would she do national service? She just said that it is the men's duty to protect the nation. Then, I am like huh? She preached so much on equality.It is as if she just takes whatever that benefits her from equality and disregards anything disadvantageous that comes from equality. Is this feminism? Is the male partner of a feminist suppose to feel so cornered? Is this the future?I have worked on this relationship for 3 years. It is stressful to be around her and I feel quite lifeless. I am still holding on to the relationship because of the sheer amount of effort I have put into keep it together. I don't know if this will pay off or if am I just being a stupid idiot holding on to this.-#96959: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96959","['Like: 34 people', 'Care: 18 people', 'Haha: 12 people']",86 comments,14 shares
96947,"Please don’t filter. Need some advice here...I (26M) met this girl (23F) from dating app in September last year and we hit it off pretty well. She’s smart, lovely and hardworking and that really caught my attention. We texted each other like long lost friends and never run out of conversations. We texted each daily and only in December that we decided to officially meetup. After the first meetup, we made plans to met up every other weekend to spend time together. We would take turns to plan for the weekend meet and over a short span of time, we travelled to almost all places where a couple can visit in Singapore. One night after our dinner in January, she officially asked me to be together. I felt so comfortable around her and of course I immediately agreed to it. To be honest, I’ve never loved someone so much in my life before and I was so happy to have found her. I enjoyed every second with her and I see her as a life partner. Then on, I started having tons of plans for our future and want to eventually marry her and start a family together.She always wears a gold necklace given to her by her mum and she always tells me how much it meant to her. This is her first relationship and wanting it to be special and memorable for her, I bought her a pair of gold earrings to remember our first Valentines together. Hoping that the earrings will be something meaningful to her, I intend to give it to her and put it on for her at the end of the day. We went for our dinner and walked around the mall. I was acting the whole time after dinner as if like I was looking for a gift for her. In fact, I already got her something. We walked pass a goldsmith and I just looked at the gold pieces on display. She held onto my hand and told me not to buy anything expensive for her or she’ll be angry and she pulled me away from the shop. Not wanting her to be angry, I kept the earrings in my car and only gave her a bouquet of tulips that I got beforehand. Till today the earrings are still with me.After being together for a few weeks, her text came in short streams and replies came in after hours. Back then I thought she’s just busy with work and doesn’t have time to reply and I didn’t think too much. Our weekly planned “dates” started becoming just a normal lunch and head back home kind of routine. She started being cold towards me and I wonder what I did wrongly to upset her... I wanted to find a chance to talk to her and fix things but never had the chance to do so. Just days back on our weekly meetup, she told me she want things to end. She told me she just don’t feel it with me, she don’t see a future with me and she’s sorry... That really broke me... From a life ahead of us, everything just crash and ended there... I started having sleep issues and a great loss in appetite. Whenever I close my eyes all I can think is her. Whenever I get some proper rest, I’ll dream of her and wake up crying... Sometimes tears just roll uncontrollably when I’m at work... I always look at my phone, hoping to see a text from her. This if affecting me badly and I just can’t forget her... I really love her and I don’t want to lose her. What should I do...

96945,"Is it ever acceptable for a married person to insist on a divorce even though his/her spouse has done nothing wrong?My mom has recently suggested that she wants a divorce with my dad even though my dad is possibly the most responsible and faithful father and husband in the world. Since they've been married 25 years ago, my father has surrendered all income to my mom and received a small allowance every month. He is a freelance consultant and he earns close to $1500 every DAY, but my mom only gives him $3000 a month. Any more and he would have to ask for it. My mom deals with all the finances at home. The condo is paid off, a gift from my grandfather on my dad's side. My dad does all the cleaning at home, he washes up after every meal (even though my mom always cooks), he does the laundry, and he does all the repairs and maintenance. My mom calls herself a ""housewife"" but honestly, my dad has been more of a ""housewife"" for the 25 years I have been alive. My dad doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, he works his ass off for the family, and he also buys her presents/dinner EVERY SINGLE year on her birthday, on their marriage anniversary, and on the anniversary of the first time they met. He spares no expense, DESPITE the fact that he only has $3000 a month to spend. My mom, on the other hand, never remembers. She even had the audacity to say to me, after I asked her why she never once bought anything or even wrote a nice letter to my dad on his birthday, that ""[she] cooks for him every day."" I am speechless.But let's just set that all aside and let's discuss the institution of marriage for a moment.When we marry someone, we promise to be with them for the rest of our lives. It's a commitment, it's a contract. If anyone ever doubts that they will be able to make the commitment of time, then they should never have agreed to enter into that contract in the first place.My mom is suggesting a divorce because she feels, and I quote, she doesn't love my dad anymore. The whole framework of my dad was destroyed, and he still continues to work. I have not spoken to her for 6 months after I heard her say that to my face, and I will probably not speak to her for the rest of my life. Please respect the institution of marriage. When you're married to someone, unless he/she is unfaithful, or does anything illegal, please, don't mess around.-#96945: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96945","['Like: 207 people', 'Sad: 102 people', 'Care: 25 people']",123 comments,71 shares

96934,"I’ve recently been diagnosed with a chronic disorder. According to the doctor, although its not deadly, it is currently still incurable. But I’ll still be able to lead a typical lifestyle except during relapses, which is unfortunately, unpredictable as there are no known triggers. The problem is, the doctor said that such disorders may be due to genetics, which means that if I have children in future, they might get the disorder. My boyfriend and I originally intend to have children in future. But because of this, I have expressed that I have changed my mind about having children for fear of passing down this illness to them. I’ll feel very guilty if our children’s lives are affected due to our decision (the pains of the relapses, having to live on medication etc). However, my boyfriend’s stance is that we should still give it a try since there is no guarantee that the illness will be passed down.  I really don’t think it’s right to take the risk knowing the possibility of passing down the illness, but he seems unconvinced.He is also not open to the idea of adoption as he wants his very own child, and that his parents are quite traditional and are likely not to agree too.I don’t want to go down the route of breakup as we really love each other alot. In fact, I really appreciate that he is very supportive and encouraging during this period when I received my diagnosis and took care of me when I had my relapse.-#96934: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96934","['Like: 22 people', 'Care: 18 people']",46 comments,2 shares

96930,"So this happened today:I have ordered my food and looking for a seat while the food was prepared at one of the food courts in Jurong East. It was during the peak dinner time and the seats in the food court was mostly full, making it difficult to find a seat. After searching for some time, I saw this young couple in their early 30s who was eating with 2 empty seats beside them (it was a corner table) and I asked politely if I can sit beside them. To my surprise, I was promptly rejected and their reason was that they were not able to sit beside us as the rule was each group need to be separated by 1m. That made me really angry as firstly, I thought that it was only 8 people that needed to be separated by a meter, regardless of them being strangers or not (which I was wrong after I went to government website to check, they were in fact in the right to reject me) and also by the fact that this young couple was one of the only couple that rejected me in my days of eating in a crowded food court (post covid). I never had these kind of problems in town area during lunch hours and was not sure if it was a common theme among younger generations to be so anal, for a lack of better word, about these kind of things.For me, I've never rejected anyone who wishes to share a table for the simple reason that I value efficiency (I'm by no means a good person/saint). Perhaps we need to be strictly following what the government says about social distancing and the right thing is to suggest to the fellow diner to consume their food in the toilet cubical, especially so if you are rushing for time since I value my piracy too much to share this table with you. (or maybe the dude is really concerned about covid spreading). Eventually I managed to find another couple in their 50s who were VERY willing to share their adjacent seats with me. But guess what? After I've consumed my food, the previous couple actually found a safe distancing ambassador to speak to the manager of that food court who went to on inform me that our young Singaporean couple was indeed right to reject my request and she told me that I shouldn't forcefully sit with them which I didn't (though I did indicate my intention to sit with them to consume my meal). Note that this couple actually went around the food court to look for me as they had no idea where I went to sit at as I was at the other part of the food court (or maybe I might have already finished my meal, but these guys were determined!)There are some bits and pieces which I left out and I'm not fully proud of my actions as I sort of lost my cool when confronting the young couple initially, I admit that they are on the right side of the law and I was wrong to call them out when they are doing the right thing, but I'm just amazed at the lack of empathy shown to a fellow Singaporean. Maybe I'm completely out of line here and this couple should be the epitome of a good Singaporean, or maybe I'm representing the majority, who would volunteer their adjacent seats to others in need. Kinda interesting to see how the others in this page feels...-#96930: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96930","['Like: 18 people', 'Angry: 12 people', 'Haha: 11 people']",52 comments,5 shares

It's been since late 2019 since I last went back home to see my family, to gaze at the scenery and eat the food that I've loved since young. And now because of travel restrictions and quarantine, it's over a year and a half since I've gone back to visit my family, especially my grandparents, who cry to me every call, missing me because they're both increasingly ill and they don't think they have much time left. It breaks my heart every time, yet I'm powerless because I'm barred from returning home from all the restrictions. I miss the mountainous terrains of the countryside, the starry night skies and the fragrance of food that I loved.Academics and work are suffocating enough, the lack of prospect of when I can go home just put me in deeper despair.

96907,"Prof Ben, seek your opinion on work related stuff. I’m a fresh grad and had just started work for a year. In the beginning, I was happy and mix well with everybody. In work,I have a group of friends that I always will hang out with, not super close, but consider a family at work. Each of us will help each other and we work closely as a team. When I was new and not sure about the workflow etc, they will help me and I accepted their help.Slowly, I learnt more, and I have my own judgment on things and I do not need their help so much like before. But this group of friends think that I’m still a baby and always ‘help’ me on things that I should be making decisions by myself. There are so many episodes but I tahan and didn’t express because I think they are out of good will to help me.One day, this colleague she did the same thing again. I was working and I had an answer in my mind already, she jumped in and gave a different instruction to my clients that is totally not what I wanted to do. I stopped her in front of the clients, before she could further explain what she wants to do to them. I didn’t accept her help this time because I think this’s serious and if the client has any accident happen I will be the one people will place blame because the decision is made under my account. So I stopped her right in front of the client’s face. She angry. She angry coz i didn’t respect her, and cut her off in front of clients. I am angry too. So we fought. I was angry because she has been making judgment call all day long and without discussing w me, she directly told my clients what she wants to do, and all that decisions are documented under my name. I will be the one who will attend court if harm is made, not her. Professionally I’m right, my decision is in the best interest of my clients.I confronted her but she think she not wrong, she thinks it’s my fault because I refused to accept her help and I disgraced her in front of clients.I brought this up to my superior. But she is very good at talking. She told boss that the client may make complaint to our institution head because of the way I talk to her as client might think we dunno know our work well hence we have different opinions. And I kena scolded by boss for this. I explained my point of view to my boss that she doesn’t know the client well n yet making call without consulting me first. But I don’t know whether she got scolded by boss or not. Ever since then we seldom talk. We used to talk about life/bf/jokes but now we only talk about work related things, like we are not friend anymore. I’m worried that if I start to be friendly to her she will turn around and talk behind my back, which she always does. My concern is, I might lose my social circle if I’m not friend w her.  At work, we somehow will need to socialise and i feel sad of losing a ‘friend’ at work. Although she is not my good good friend but I stand a chance to lose my gang at work. I dun care about her because professionally I’m right, I care about my social circles. But I dunwan to be so fake like her. Idk I somehow turning to be the Adult I used to hate. I know I’ll keep changing to fit this world, and I dunwan  to lose ‘me’.  So prof Ben, how do I draw the line to distance them from changing me and at the same time keeping my social circle?

96901,"*apologise for any error or typo, and mentioning of race to try explain the story, and it might be complicated*I was at Bishan Junction 8 pet lover's today, 15/04/2021 at 7:28pm. My friend and I went into the store to get some hamster treats. When i first went into the the store, there was already a chinese lady who was with her son talking to 2 of the staff working there. There was also another indian lady at the payment counter. My friend and i didnt think much, we were just looking at the pets and then we started hearing this lady shouting. The chinese lady turned out to be a freaking KAREN LOL.KAREN kept shouting at the staff and shouted things like-""I'm very disappointed in you""""You will have to pay for it, you're responsible""""I will complain about you""""We are very sincere YOU KNOW"""" I CALLED YOU AT 12PM TO TELL YOU WE WILL BE COMING DOWN TONIGHT""""THEY HAVE PIANO LESSONS YOU KNOW""( referring to her son and her daughter who was with her husband which both of them were not there at that point of time )"" DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO COME HERE FROM EAST COAST???1111?1!11?1?1?1?11!!"""" DONT SAY SORRY TO ME SAY SORRY TO HIM"""" THEY CAME HERE WITHOUT EATING DINNER YOU KNOW?!?!??????!?""THIS karen was shouting and saying that she came in yesterday but because the store was closing, they couldnt make up their mind if they want this freaking rabbit, so they said they will come back today. I didn't get the any of the staff's name but the staff who talked to this KAREN on the phone told her the Pet lover's policy is that they are not allowed to reserve pets just by using words over the phone( they said the call was made at about 12pm ). common sense ?? no ?? no guarantee no nothing, just words? The indian lady also called up the store to give them a heads up, the staff also said that she also told the indian lady the samepolicy and there is also another customer who is interested in getting the rabbit.The Indian lady was there first and already bought the necessities for her new pet rabbit, like cage and whatever not. When she paid for everything, Karen went into the stall and found out that the rabbit was already sold. KAREN was obviously unhappy and started shouting those things above. She also raised her voiced at the staff asking"" WHO IS IT ?!? WHO YOU SELL IT TO ?!? ""and the staff pointed to the indian lady beside her son LOL this KAREN dare not shout at the Indian lady so she took it out on the poor staff ????The staff again, tried explain to KAREN why the rabbit was sold, and kept apologising. KAREN BEING KAREN obviously shouted even louder and louder infront of her son. So Karen called her husband down LOLOL typical Karen move. JUST SAYING, the husband did nothing at all and he kept quiet the whole entire time. So the more Karen couldnt get the cute rabbit, she kept asking her husband to do something about it.So KAREN and family was blocking the entrance, the staff who was being shouted at started tearing up but quickly wiped away her tears and went out behind them to welcome other customers in. Karen wasnt done so she stepped back and continue barking at the staff. The second staff went to call the supervisor and tried explaining the situation but also broke down. The supervisor told the staff to call security and then security came down. When 2 of the security came down, they asked the safe entry staff ( because he was the one who called them ) what happened and he just pointed to all of us. I pointed at KAREN. When Karen saw the 2 security officer, she asked them 'What's the problem?? can you solve this for us? no? I'm dealing this with her!1!1?!?!?1!1!"" and the staff didnt want to trouble them so she told them it's ok. So  basically the security guards just stood beside Karen's family and did nothing but kept quiet the entire time LOL thanksThe staff apologised again and said that she understand that she's very angry and it's her fault.  but KAREN pointed to her children and told the staff - ""DONT SAY SORRY TO ME!1!1!1!11!!11!!!!!!! SAY SORRY TO THEM""The staff didnt hesitate a single bit and step forward and apologised to KAREN DNA kids. LMAO the entire time when KAREN was inside the store with her son, he was just staring into blank space. Suddenly he 'cried' when the staff apologised and went behind KAREN. At this point, I told my friend about it and he stepped forward. He told KAREN to not raise her voice and to not shout anymore because there were many passerby who stopped and stare. It must have been really embarrassing for the staff what??? Karen not happy so she told my friend -""Keep quiet, I'm having a conversation with her""My friend fired back saying, "" No you're not, you're shouting at her and she dont have to deal with your attitude"" KAREN'S PRIDE MUST HAVE BEEN HURT at this point, and she asked my friend "" WHAT ATTITUDE?!1?1?1! ""My friend then told the staff-""just go in, you dont have to deal with her attitude""He then looked at Karen and told her"" if you're unhappy, you can just call the police.""Then at Karen's husband"" Please control your wife ""KAREN'S HUSBAND kept tapping her arm said let's go. NO USE LORRRR. AND SHE OBV DIDNT CALL the police la cause she knew she was out of line I pulled the staff back into the store and she kept telling me she was okay and it was her fault. Then i told KAREN she was abusing the staff, she's so crazy in the head she can ask me how is she doing that. HER daughter who is about like p3/4, said to me "" but we already called about the rabbit "" lmao and i answered, didnt the staff already tellyou about their policy ???I told her she have been shouting and raising her voice for 30minutes. "" ARE YOU SURE 30MINS ?!??!?!?! """" urm yes ???? ""and then she kept quiet LOL and then she ask me to SHUT UPso i was already very frustrated at how self entitled she is, i shouted back at her.i told her to stfu and shes a f*cking b*tch, i know it was unnecessary but she really went out of line by shouting at the staff NON STOP. demoralising the staff by saying she's irresponsible and unreasonable. telling the staff she will pay for itblah blah nonsense ????? this my first every time witnessing a karen. SHOUTING and fighting over a freaking rabbit. Then her daughter suddenly went from like omg we called about the rabbit to ma im sorry we dont want the rabbit anymore. One of the secuirty uncle looked at me and signaled me to keep quiet and not say anything. LOL OK THANK YOU COMING DOWN you can go back up and secure this mall. please restrict all karens next time thank you ????SO karen gave up after she was being fired back atand started walking away and mubling to herself. HOW is she not embarrassed for acting so rowdy and disgusting in public over a freaking rabbit???? Even when the staff cried infront of her, she have no freaking remorse or whatsoever LOLI hope pet lover's do not believe the shit this KAREN says LMAO-#96901: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96901","['Like: 299 people', 'Haha: 111 people']",153 comments,167 shares

I don't mind to care for her. What hurt me is the way she treated me when I myself am unwell. Compared to her, I am relatively healthy, I rarely got sick and am in good health majority of the time. But recently I got appendicitis, and even after operation the surgery area hurt a lot for almost 2 weeks. And she became very sarcastic and cold, telling me to ""not make pathetic looking face"" and ""please don't talk in that weak voice"". Once I twisted my ankle while playing badminton, and while going home she told me not to lean on her because it's very shameful for her.Similar things happened a few times before, she becomes very cold and tells me not to ""act weak and pathetic"" when I am injured or not feeling well. I actually brought it up to her recently and said it hurts a lot when you do that, as I try my best to care for you. And she got really mad and said I don't understand that girls want a strong man. She said things like ""no girl wants a guy that act weak"" and when I said sometimes it's really painful especially my surgery, she got even angrier and said ""do you think it is worse than period?"". I said I'm not asking you to care for me, just to understand it hurts, and she kept saying all girls hate guys who act pathetic and guys don't understand that girls get pain every month and we don't have the right to act weak.Do a lot of girls think this way? I don't have a lot of female friends. It's hurtful as, I mean her periods are not my fault, I've tried to be as helpful and accommodating as I can when she has them, which I feel is the least a guy can do. Plus she has a lot of other problems which I try to take care of. I don't need her to take care when I have my own, just not be so cold to me will be less hurtful.-#96865: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96865","['Sad: 77 people', 'Like: 43 people', 'Care: 28 people']",139 comments,20 shares
96863,"Just a rant that many people might not like (maybe admin doesn't like it and won't bother posting as well).I think majority of Singaporeans are getting less and less competitive. Becoming more and more like the US, anything goes wrong just blame others, never their own fault. Blame others for taking away their jobs, yet never reflect and see if they themselves are providing more value to the company. If you can't compete on price because of difference in cost of living, then compete in terms of value. I've seen Singaporeans around me who grew up in low-average income families, and yet they can achieve high positions and comfortable salaries. Why aren't they losing their jobs then?Any positive data they the government provides, such as improvement in economy or drop in unemployment, it is always bullshit to them because they are not part of the % who have improved. To them, if they are suffering, means others must also be suffering. I don't even come from NUS, I'm from a mediocre university with mediocre results and no CCA or accomplishments to speak of, yet it is still not impossible for a fresh grad like me to find a job. Though the salary is not as high as some of the salaries I've seen on this page, it is still a job I want nevertheless. I even have friends who went for courses under skillsfuture and found jobs from there, without having a university degree. And yet there are people claiming that this is useless?If you can't help yourself, no one can help you. These are the kind of people they will claim that I'm being a government mouthpiece, because they don't have any valid counter-arguments. There's the saying ""the grass is greener on the other side,"" but honestly, I'm pretty glad I'm born in Singapore when I look at many other countries.-#96863: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96863","['Like: 109 people', 'Haha: 10 people']",21 comments,12 shares

96855,"The pleasures and sorrows of hospital pharmacyTo establish my background, let’s just say I have served at an understaffed hospital outpatient pharmacy for what feels like an indeterminate infinity.The pleasures: first and foremost, the chance to observe life and be philosophical about it…My job provides me a unique position to interact with numerous people daily, the majority of whom have suffered from various diseases, some of which appear quite invisible to society, yet very obvious to me.The rich and the poor suffer illnesses alike, but as inequality strikes, the poor suffer more, for they often cannot afford their medications. Many are under government assistance. I can glimpse a glimmer of embarrassment in their eyes when they collect their free medications. For these deserving poor people, I try to make the process of not paying for medicine as blasé as possible, without embarrassing them. In other words, I have the pleasure to deal out hope and kindness in people’s bleakest of times.The ones that get my goats are the filthy rich who stay at good class bungalows and try to cut the registration line. Their stories are implausible, excuses laughable, often clinging to their status, wealth or connections to some VIPs. I am so and so and I know so and so. Likewise, some of the extreme poor, with little to lose, will throw outright tantrums at the pharmacy in order to have their ways. Under these circumstances, I can’t help, but strangely and un-regrettably indulge in the guilty pleasure of judging these people immensely.One after another, grown men and women rise to their feet, walking or hobbling to my counter to pick up the medications to alleviate their pain in one way or another. I observe first-hand how people suffer at different stages in life. For the female sex, their problems can be Flagystatin for a yeast infection, then Misoprostol for an unwanted pregnancy and at the later life stage, Vagifem for post-menopausal dryness. As for the male species, they may need minoxidil initially then sildenafil and may even progress to PGE injectionsFor the other poor unfortunate souls of both sexes, they may suffer from some obscure congenital diseases that destroy their kidneys and start them on the path of dialysis and transplantation and a lifetime of hospital visits. Perched from this vantage point, even my over-exhausted brains can’t help but feel saddened for those who suffer relentlessly, for the patients, for the carers… Somehow, even wedged in the middle of the maddening crowd, we nevertheless retain some compassionate reflexes, a remnant of empathy for a suffering human fellow.The patients, their bodies and minds, ravaged by diseases, often lead them to voice endless hostilities against hospital staff. Some of these people go to the hospitals daily, their eyes sometimes filled with hope but more often, despair.I go to hospital daily too. But unlike them, I am paid to be here. So, I try not to take any of the verbal abuse personally, even though they like to threaten to write my names in the feedback form, which may reach my management and may or may not affect my KPI. But frankly, I am beyond caring about pleasing the upper management who live in their ivory towers and care little for the “real” frontline staff.What about the sorrows?Towards the end of every workday, I am physically and mentally exhausted, from talking 8-10 hours non-stop to people, explaining not-always-logical healthcare policies to them, telling off the ones who try to cut queues, calling doctors to discuss the therapies, etc . All these are done under the disapproving eyes of impatient people staring daggers.  Some of them circulate like flies unhelpfully near the dispensing counters, demanding their medications to be given out immediately without regards to the other fellow patient beings.Little did they know, our upper hospital management subject us to the same waiting time criticism, yet neglect to point out that we are perpetually short of staff because the management cannot afford to employ more people because millions of dollars have been spent on an expensive IT system that has needed 34 updates since its implementation three years ago. I wonder whether the IT system might not be part of the very problem that it had been designed to address, whether its production was not indeed contributing to precisely the feelings of frustration and nervous tension which it claims to alleviate.I wonder out loud to my colleagues why in our society the greatest sums of money so often tended to accrue from the sale of the least meaning things, and why the dramatic improvements in efficiency and productivity at the heart of any Quality Improvement Projects so seldom extend beyond lip service.Staff are exhorted to complete the department feedback surveys multiple times. Improving staff morale rarely extend beyond endless early morning meetings and brainless engagements that in fact exhaust staff more.Never far from doubting the wisdom of my own career choice, I was quite pleasantly surprised when a friend at a gym commented “Meaningful!” when told that I work as a pharmacist at a hospital.When does a job feel meaningful, really? Whenever it allows us to generate delight or reduce suffering in othersTo be honest, I am jaded but, stoically I carry on because deep down, very few people can claim their jobs have a hand in reducing suffering, yet unlike doctors I would never have to do a digital rectal examination in my entire professional life. Suffice it to say, this works out well so far because I ,incidentally am also a germaphobia. What can I say to my junior? An understandable hunger for fees from potential students tempts the school to overpromise, like the out of practice prof who out of greed or sentimentality, sometimes imply that all of their pharmacy students could one day produce worthwhile career, rather than frankly acknowledging the troubling truth, that to achieve great positions is an anomalous event. Indeed, virtually everything the student believes to be true, because their teacher has told them so, turns out to be the exact opposite. Beware, for experience might just be the cloak worn by charlatans and humbugs.For the rest of history, for the most of us, our bright promise will always fall short; it will hardly earn us bountiful sums of money or beget us extraordinary fame. Resilience, Diligence and Intelligence are needed to redraw the map of our reality, which we ourselves must find the path.#nuspharmacy-#96855: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96855","['Like: 163 people', 'Care: 22 people', 'Love: 11 people']",17 comments,31 shares
96849,"Hi guys! Can I ask you for your advice on how to deal with terrible neighbours? There is an 50 yr+ Indian uncle downstairs who has tried to blackmail us 2 times. We called the police but only reports have been made. We still have to deal with the guy. Background of this terrible neighbour:- He blasts 70s music loud until 1st floor (he lives on 10th) many times. Neighbours complain about him and it is in the police report.- He is alcoholic and often showed up in the lift with alcohol smells. - He has thrown things down from the windows (left-over food, rubbish etc.) One time it was a monitor. Thankfully there was a balcony at 8th floor. No one gets hurt so far. Neighbours complain about him and it is in the police report.- He often makes stories up and complains about other people. He reported a few to police. None of those stories were true. - He blackmailed my parents last year. He said the clothes they hanged were too wet that the water dripped to his phone and spoiled it. He asked for S$50. I wasn't at home. My poor parents were confused and gave in so that he won't continue to give trouble.Today he banged on the door again and said I made noise on the floor and he couldn't sleep. But I was napping in bed. So I politely asked him to leave. He refused and started to shout. And he started to ask if I am alone at home (I am a female) and ask me to open the door. He also tore the decoration on my door. I called the police and put the police on speaker mode. He got scared and threatened me he would come back. Then he quickly left my door. After 10 min, 2 police officers showed up and I explained everything to them. They went to the uncle's house to look for him. No one answered the door. Again, police made reports and left. I am thankful for the quick response of the police. Yet reality hits me that this uncle is still wondering around my neighbourhood. I believe that majority of our society is nice and kind. But it always has a few individuals that put us at risk. How do I protect myself before something bad happens as a small-size female? He dare to destroy the decoration on my door in front of my face. I am not sure when I am not around what other crazy stuff he can do. He knows my face too. I am scared to move around my neighbourhood alone now.My sincere gratitude.-#96849: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96849","['Angry: 34 people', 'Like: 33 people', 'Care: 6 people']",56 comments,8 shares

Dr Lee is offering the students who cheated a chance to own up for more lenient punishment, while those who choose not to own up (but are already discovered) who be brought up to the Dean and higher management for further punishment.

I did ask her why didn't she say no or get out of that place but she said she did, but he was forceful and did whatever he wanted. All she thought was to ""let this be over with so I can get out"". After he was done she hurriedly tried to clean it off, got dressed up and left. This was around 4 years ago.I was sharing my experience too when I was pulled to an isolated staircase with a random uncle as a kid... He also did unspeakable things to me and I didn't know what was happening until I grew up and realised. I felt very humiliated and ashamed of myself. This was around a decade ago.What I wanted to ask was is it still possible for either of us to make a report? I don't really want anything to happen but I just feel like some closure would be good for her especially.

96822,"Some people are so “nice”. They are always willing to do all the nice things for you although you didn’t ask them to do all those for you. But strangely, when you’re unable to fulfil their expectations, they will say that they are disappointed in you. A nice person won’t tell everyone about the things they have done for you. A nice person do things quietly and do not expect you to return the favour. A nice person will not tell everyone what they have done for you and then complain about how you disappoint them if you’re not as nice as them. Just because someone is nice to you, it doesn’t give them the right to demand something from you. If you can’t meet their expectations, it’s not your problem. It’s their problem for having expectations. Do not let someone guilt-trip you into changing yourself to meet their expectations. Be thankful and appreciate what they have done for you and that’s good enough. If you want to do nice things for them, good for you. If you don’t want to, that’s fine too. Some people do nice things for you, not because they want you to be happy but because they want something in return. What do they want? Compliance, obedience, control, power? Or they just want to portray a good image? Or they think being nice is an obligation or responsibility? Or they do not want to look like they are selfish humans? Some people are nice to you, not because of you, but because of themselves. Yet they think the problem is YOU when you are not as nice as them. They say you are a selfish person when you say ‘no’ to them. They say you are selfish when you cannot return the favour. They say you are selfish if you do not care about them as much as they care about you. They blame you for being ungrateful. They blame you for their disappointment when in the first place, they were the ones who willingly chose to be nice. What is a nice person?A nice person gives without asking anything in return. A nice person cares for you and does not calculate how much you care for them in return. A nice person will not set expectations and get angry when you don’t meet them. A nice person will not do anything that would hurt you and would genuinely apologise if they have unintentionally hurt you. A nice person listens to you patiently instead of constantly talking about themselves all the time. A nice person respects you, your feelings and your personality. They do not claim that your feelings are not valid and they do not ask you to change your personality.A nice person does not expect you to be as nice as them. They only hope that you would treat them with basic respect. If they are upset at you due to your lack of respect, they will gently tell you about their feelings instead of blaming you for their feelings. To have a nice person as a family, friend or partner is a privilege. If you have them in your life, please cherish them and do not mistake their kindness for weakness. Please don’t ever disrespect them. Don’t blame them if they can’t meet your expectations. They are just humans who are fighting their own battles. Even if you think their battles are insignificant, it doesn’t mean they are not struggling. And it doesn’t mean they have the capacity to fulfil your expectations. Being nice is not an obligation. Being nice is a choice and it takes alot of effort to be nice to people. If someone is genuinely nice to you without expectations, please appreciate them.Thank you KY & YT for being the nicest humans I have ever known. Thank you for always being there for me, listening to me for hours when I feel down, reassuring me when other people try to make me feel inferior, doing all these nice things for me without expecting anything in return. I’m not a good listener like the both of you yet you all have never expected me to be a good listener. I’m not as nice as the both of you but you all have never expected me to be as nice. You all have done so much for me, without complaints, without judgement, without asking me to change my selfish behaviour. Just quietly being there for me, listening to my problems, supporting me in whatever I do, and doing all the nice things for me without asking me to do the same for you all. I don’t even know what I have done to deserve you all.

96815,"How do people deal with it if their partner's personality changes, sometimes not for the better? I'd share the stories of my past 2 rs and would like to ask for advice on how to handle any future rs.Girl A, 2 year+ rs. She was a cheerful, happy-go-lucky girl. About a year into our rs, a close aunt of her unexpectedly passed away from cancer. From that point on, she gradually became depressed and lose her cheerfulness. At first, I was there for her, hearing her out and hope that her wounds would heal with time. However, as time passed, it looked like it was more difficult than first thought. She became more and more pessimistic about things in general. Our dates often are sombre and she would say something pessimistic or sad about virtually any topic we talk about. She couldn't laugh anymore. Despite professional help, her condition didn't really improve much. At that time, I was also having some personal issues on top of my stressful school work and these just add on to my worries. I realized that it was affecting my mental health as well and dragging me down and decided to end the rs once and for all. Girl B, 2 year rs. What attracted me to her was her simple down to earth and thrifty nature. We met when I was in my 3rd year and she was in her 4th. A few months after we got together, she graduated and went into the working world. However, over time she became influenced by her colleagues and the work environment and became more materialistic. She would start buying branded bags, makeup and clothes which she never did before. She was not satisfied with the simple pleasures of life anymore. We used to eat at food courts and hawker centres but she started asking me to go and eat those pricier food. I talked to her twice and while she did change her behaviour, it was only temporary and she would slowly go back to her usual pattern. Her work environment was stressful and being affected by the stress, she became a lot more moody and would throw her temper at the slightest things. I saw that she was no longer the person I knew and also fearing for my finances if I settle down with her, I ended things as well.When people first got together, each person is often attracted to some qualities of the other. However, as we know people can change over time. The person may not be the same 1 year, 5 years or 20 years later. I am afraid that if I go into the next rs, I may bail out again once the person's personality changes and affects me negatively and the cycle will repeat. I hope anyone can advise me how to handle such issues in a long term rs or is bailing out the only option?-#96815: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96815","['Like: 37 people', 'Haha: 9 people', 'Sad: 7 people']",83 comments,9 shares

This wasn't the only relationship you destroyed, but one of the many others too. Have you not felt a single guilt or even a morsel of remorse with all the carnage you left behind? Aren't you ashamed of all the emotional wreckage you bring to everyone you claimed you love or called them your friend? How much lower are you going to stoop?All i can say to you is you have done enough emotional damage to people. Quit going back to your ex lovers with all your problems and expecting them to solve them for you by manipulating them. You have emotionally abused too many people at this point and even sent some down the path of depression. Maybe i am being too harsh on you, but i believe someone needs to call you out on your shit. Telling you directly (multiple times) about your toxic behaviours doesn't seem to stop you from doing them, shall leave it out to the society to teach you the proper ways. Making people constantly think they are worthless by taunting them that you don't want or need them anymore, telling them that you'll leave and ditch them. People aren't toys for you to pick up when you need them and throw aside when they are done helping with your issues. Taking advantage of people's trust and goodwill to satisfy your own needs with your constant lies and manipulation - you really went too far. You are a serial cheater and you do need to seek professional help. Every feeling or emotion that comes your way is valid, it is your right to feel and think a certain way. but what actions you take for those feelings/emotions is your responsibility.Every action has its own consequences, what goes around comes around.To date, you can consider yourself lucky that karma hasn't hit you back with everything you've done. You aren't a christian yourself, but heed this - Proverbs 6:32I sincerely hope that you are aware and come to realise the full impact of your own actions and the toxicity you bring about to people. I hope that you aren't repeating history with your current boyfriend, because nobody deserves or needs to deal with mind games and emotional abuse. I hope you will gain the balls to sincerely apologize to the people you've hurt so badly. Now, thinking back on everything I have done for you, I have decided that you are not worth my time staying up till dawn for. I am done dealing with such a toxic character.

I'm happy about the offer but given that I was rejected from so many positions, it kind of makes me feel like the hiring managers are just anyhow hiring people.

She and guy B has been sleeping with each other for the entire 7 months that we were there overseas. Many of the times they were doing the deed while she was on the phone call with guy A. She and guy B decided to stop the deed as we all were coming back to singapore. Little did i know, they were still sleeping with each other now that they are in Singapore.

96791,"Is it hypocritical for climate change activist to have children? The average lifetime carbon footprint of a single person is around 20 metric tonnes. Since having children is always a choice, especially since abortions are legal in Singapore, you will contribute 20 metric tonnes of carbon each time you decide to bring a new life onto the earth. The whole basis of environmentalism, the biggest reason why we do it, is to preserve the habitability of the earth for future generations. Yet, in deciding to create future generations of people, we also choose to contribute substantially to global carbon emissions. It is ultimately a little bit disingenuous to say that on one hand I care about environmental degradation, but on another hand I want to make a decision that will evidently cause continual harm to the environment, long after I am dead. I think we can all be a little more ethically consistent. If we're supporting environmentalism for the sake of the earth and animals, then we should stop making humans because humans are the problem. If we want to continue to make more humans, then we should accept that environmental degradation is an unavoidable byproduct due to the Tragedy of the Commons, and any behavioral modification on the scale of 7 billion people is either going to be an insurmountable challenge, or too late to bring about any significant change in our climate trajectory.-#96791: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96791","['Like: 60 people', 'Haha: 33 people']",65 comments,8 shares

96784,"A few weeks ago I found out from my close friend that my gf was on a dating app. He even showed me her profile, and according to her profile description and photos, that profile seems legit and doesn't seem like a catfish. Not saying that my gf is ugly or what, but at least I know she doesn't have the look that people might want to use to impersonate. TBH I'm quite devastated when I saw that, cos we've been together for 3 years plus, and even planned when to BTO, so I decided to confront her to find out the truth and whether she is cheating on me. During the confrontation, she told me that she was just tempted to play with dating apps since her friends around her are happily meeting guys and girls through the app, but she has no intention to meet or talk to the guys that matched her. She said she only used them for a few days just for fun, see how the guys on dating apps look like, and partly due to curiosity as well, but she has already deleted the apps. Despite her assurance and explanation, I've been bothered by this situation for a few weeks, and I'm very tempted to see who she matched with and what she talked to those guys about. Is this considered a breach of her privacy? I don't usually check her phone or see what she chats with her male friends about, but right now I really have the urge to see her conversations with those guys, am I right for doing so?-#96784: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96784","['Like: 58 people', 'Sad: 17 people', 'Haha: 8 people']",82 comments,12 shares

96775,"Hello to the poster of #96745. I once faced the science vs arts dilemma back in JC. I took a more science and maths heavy combination in secondary school but was always much more inclined to studying the humanities and social sciences (in terms of interest and aptitude). But despite spending so much more time studying for my science and maths subjects, history and geography were my only A1s for my O-Levels.In the early weeks of JC I took a leap of faith and transferred from a Bio-Chem-Maths-Econ combi to a more humanities/social science-centric one. In retrospect it was one of the best decisions I ever made. In fact, if anything, I regret taking H2 rather than H1 math. I spent 65%-70% of my time studying for H2 math compared to my other subjects combined, and I have forgotten almost all the math I studied (although I still have a relatively decent understanding of the arts subjects I studied).In JC it is going to be even tougher. The students taking natural science subjects will generally be those who did well in those subjects for their O-levels (or the year 4 IP exams). And the same will be the case for uni. I am not discounting the possibility that hard work can turn things around, but you have to be aware that there will be students who will have a very high aptitude for the natural sciences who are willing to work as hard as you are (or even harder). Additionally, there are many courses at NUS that one can pursue if one’s strengths are in arts subjects such as those offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and Faculty of Law to name a few. I have seen far too many students choose a course in uni they lacked an interest in only to regret it afterwards (it can be a very long 3-4 years).You seem to be suggesting that you are more inclined to studying arts subjects. If so, you may wish to consider pursuing this route in JC. Studying something you enjoy and are good at is truly a double blessing. That being said, what subjects to pursue in JC is ultimately a choice only you can make for yourself and I wish you all the best in making your decision.-#96775: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96775",['Like: 16 people'],10 comments,2 shares

96762,"Dating advice Just some bit of context of my life first - I went to NUS for half a sem, didn’t enjoy the course I was doing but couldn’t get into the course that I wanted (med) hence I ended up going to australia to pursue my passion. I’ve since graduated and have been working as a doctor for 5 years now, and I’m now 30 and still single, and have just moved back to Singapore.I’ve been trading big in the stock market (I made some pretty risky moves with my salary and savings - basically I went all or nothing) and with luck on my side, I made pretty big gains as well, and have cashed out earlier this year post the bull run around the time I’ve moved back to Singapore. I’ve indulged quite a little and bought a $12M house in a posh district as an investment, and I’ve also bought a brand new jaguar for me and my family to share. (I decided with my parents that we were going to stay in our old place - a 5 room HDB flat in the east which we have been occupying for 20 years now), and rent out my investment property for more income.Anyways to the dating side of things - My friend recommended I use a dating app to try and meet someone and it’s just led to nowhere.  And this is where I really need some genuine advice.Long story short, I’ve realized that when my profile depicts my occupation and a better glimpse of my nett worth, I get way way way more interested girls (yes I’m a dude) than if I were to not. I discovered this when I made a profile in one dating app and another in a very similar dating app. In the first app I basically put in the very basics - eg a picture of me with friends, one with my family, me posing awkwardly with a selfie along ECP, my fav hawker meal, and I’ve just put down “lots of admin” under my job description as that was genuinely what I did, and my lifestyle. I then got about 5-6 matches (over the course of 4 weeks and probably hundreds of swipes later..) which apparently was not a lot but I didn’t know that since it was my first time using a dating app. The Conversations also died down really quickly. Anyway, my friend told me it was pathetic.Anyway, she then helped me remake my profile in the next dating app - which was extremely similar to the first one. I couldn’t redo my first profile as the swipes were permanent. Anyway this time round she set up my pictures of me with my new car (which I barely drive at all since my parents used it way more) and my new house (which I’m not technically even living in) and put down my occupation as “doctor”. I just laughed it off and left it as that. Oddly enough, I received likes in nearly 30% of my swipes (yes I swipe right to most people as I thought I didn’t stand a chance anyway) this time and got about 70 or so matches in 1 week. Within the next 2 months i had dates lined up nearly every day or two (which was pretty difficult given my work schedule). And to be honest I felt like I got along well with many of my dates - ie we were compatible? But I can’t help but be troubled by the fact that some of them potentially were not genuine with me? Reason why I thought so was because there were a couple of them that I remembered swiping right on in the first app, and I didn’t match with them? I thought it was a coincidence initially - eg maybe they didn’t see my profile, but then I started recalling more and more profiles from the first app I never matched with after swiping right. There was also one date who asked if she could come back to my place, which I said no to since my parents wouldn’t like it, but I caved in on the second date and brought her home, and she was a bit off and wanted to leave early from my flat. Basically it started going downhill after she asked about the house I took a picture with in my DP and I just told her that I don’t live there and laughed it off. Another date also totally bombed when I showed up after toking a bus there.My question is this, what should I do?! I did not stand a chance with anyone from my first profile and I did with my second but i am now feeling that it wasn’t who I am that attracts these girls. I am really lonely and want a companion and potentially future wife - which I can’t get at all from my first profile since I can’t even strike a date, but on my second profile it’s the flip side, where there are heaps of girls who are interested but I do not know if they’re genuine. I would want to know for sure that the other party is genuine before progressing any further in a relationship and marriage.. any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I lost it and went to snoop further the next day (I know this is wrong but I just couldn't take it anymore). One can imagine the rage, anger, despair, fear, disappointment, hopelessness when I found out about it all. And no doubt there were screams and tears, endless tears till now, and I am still feeling like an empty shell. It felt like I'm the third party breaking up a pair of perfectly in love couple. It felt like I've been living in my own little bubble of lies. It felt like all the joke's on me. I asked if they have thought of divorcing their respective spouses to get together, I asked if they were truly in love, and I was only met with silence. And this silence speaks louder than words, and felt like a sharp blade stabbing at me, repeatedly. Yet my other half proclaimed to be really sorry and regretful for all the hurt imposed on me and was willing to end it and refocus on us. I might be an overthinker, but I also don't want to go down without a fight. Even if it does end up with the inevitable, I want to be honest with myself that I've given my all to try and make it work. A no regret move, I suppose. If anything, I realise I still love my other half deeply, but the pain on some days are just so hard to bear. The triggers, the behaviours, the associations... How long more can I take this? Some days when I look out the window I'd think maybe if I just jump down, all my problems and pain will be gone, and they can be together and be truly happy. But then I think of my parents and those who care for me, I realise that's a very selfish move. But who else can I turn to? I can't tell my family or friends, because that's an immediate marriage suicide. I can't keep talking about the pain I'm feeling else I'll be the nagging spouse only to push them closer together. I came across some marriage vows the other day, ""... in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others keep thee only unto her/him as long as you both shall live?""Am I the only hopelessly naive individual to think that people still enter a monogamous marriage willingly, and has the discipline to stay true to the other party? Or has the times changed so much that marriage is no longer sacred and we ought to be more chillax and frivolous, because, YOLO, ya-know.. I need help. I need assurance. And I need hope that everything will be alright. But who else can I turn to? When can I find peace and see the light?-#96708: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96708","['Care: 147 people', 'Like: 95 people', 'Sad: 95 people']",85 comments,38 shares

96694,"I got pregnant and was forced to marry a guy who is a cheater as well as a gambler with tons of debts, or choose to get disowned by my family. He has been jobless for months and tried to scam my parents money previously using sympathy and out of my parents love for me. My love and respect for this man has died ever since.I have more savings compared to people my age group, as I am someone who is frugal and works hard in life, the only mistake I did in life is to not open my eyes big enough and fell for the wrong guy, but I do not regret getting pregnant as I have always wanted a child. Initially, my plan was to wait and see how this man would value-add to my life, change or contribute towards helping to raise the kid as the stigma of being a single mother is still there, but as time passes, this man whom I once loved has been jobless for almost a year and haven’t really been trying hard to find a job nor contribute in any way. All he does is play games, gamble online, don’t even bother to return his loans to me or my family, and watch Netflix all day.It seems like even though I’m pregnant and giving birth, he does not seem to worry that he has to work harder to contribute to the family, he can’t even feed himself, and expects me to pay for all the expenses just because I have savings. And whenever he finds me, he expects me to have sex with him and pleasure him even though I’m close to giving birth.I have read a lot of nus whisperer stories that say that singaporean girls are materialistic and go for guys with good prospects and income, whereas foreign girls do not. However, I would beg to differ. All girls would love to be doted and taken care of by their husband, which girl wouldn’t? But in this case if the man doesn’t step up, until which point should a foolish wife continue to stay with him despite his disloyalty, debts and attitude, I don’t think any foreign girls would be foolish enough still to stick around, and I definitely do not want to have to work harder in future to feed an extra mouth just because I was forced into this situation.-#96694: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96694","['Like: 89 people', 'Care: 55 people', 'Sad: 39 people']",65 comments,16 shares

Then, my dads business became successful when i was in primary school.My parents grew up poor so now that we r financially stable, they would spend on things they never got to enjoy when they were younger. I just dont agree with my dads obsession with cars. He ever told me that he never had a chance to get in a car when he was young as his parents couldnt afford it (not even a taxi ride). This may be the cause of his obession. Initially he bought 2 cars, one for my mom n one for him. When my sister got her license, he bought another car for her. Doesnt really make sense as my mom doesnt drive often so my sister could have shared it. When i got my license he bought another car using the reason that the first car has only about a year left. Now my younger sister is taking her license n instead of discouraging him to buy another car, she is encouraging him as she wants this specific car model. Obv he got excited as someone in this family is into cars as well n most likely will buy her that car once she gets her license. Also he loves antique cars n has 2 of them stored in Malaysia. Am i overreacting or is this getting out of hand?  Btw the first car has been scrapped n the second one has less than year left, hopefully he doesnt buy any new cars after this.

96678,"What's the quickest and cheapest way for someone in their mid-40s with around S$100 million in illiquid yield-generating assets to get a Singapore citizenship for retirement in Singapore? My wife's uncle is a Malaysian and he has nearly S$100 mil in real estate, earning roughly S$5 mil a year on rent alone. He is single, without children, and he wants to move to Singapore because he thinks the infrastructure in Malaysia is not suitable for retirement. He has never worked a job. He started a distribution company in his early 30s, which he sold many years back, after which he used the money to fund his purchase of a commercial office building in KL, worth around 330-350 million MYR. He has a first in land economy from Cambridge (unlikely to matter), and two masters from MIT. Ultimately he wishes to liquidate his assets in Malaysia, in exchange for some yield-generating Singapore properties, but he intends to spend every single cent before he dies. I have no clue how to help him. I know Singapore have been handing out citizenships to high net-worth individuals like HDL's founder and Dyson, but these are billionaires.

96673,"My dad is very conservatively Chinese and he has already passed on his entire asset portfolio (shares of an investment company) to my elder brother, who is 30 this year. I’m a girl and my dad has told me categorically that I will get nothing. Not that I feel I am entitled to receive anything, it’s ultimately their choice. But I just don’t like what it is doing to my brother. My brother is now a 100% owner in an investment company with a passive revenue of a little more than $2 mil with an extremely high margin. As far as I know, the business requires very little effort to run. My dad has been doing it for years and it doesn’t seem like he’d been working. My brother has quit his day job as a management consultant at an MBB company a year ago, and has since been doing nothing at home. It can’t bear the sight of watching him waste his life away.I’ve always admired my brother, who is 5 years older than I am. He went to RI/RJC, and then he graduated summa cum laude from UPenn. He had always wanted to become a professor but decided against that life the minute he inherited my dad’s business. I had always imagined he’d go on to do great things with his life, but now he has no life. My brother is also the extremely frugal type. He probably takes after my dad. He still lives with them in my parents’ 3-bedroom HDB. He spends very little on things and eats out at hawker centers on most days, dolled up in his secondary school PE shorts and army singlet. He hasn’t had a girlfriend, he doesn’t go out with friends, the last I asked him he told me he doesn’t want to date or to be married. He has always been a massive loner with very few interests, so it’s just really sad to see how boring his life is. Since he took over the company, he has given me 200K every year. I appreciate it very much because he has always doted on me. But I just wish he had someone or something who could give his life meaning. My best friend, Sara, has been close to my family for years, since we were in P1. She recently showed a bit of interest in my brother, since he is really kind, really loving, really loyal, really smart. The only problem is she’s very outgoing and my brother is honestly just very boring. The way I see it, I don’t think it will work out but she says she needs the stability in her life. Is it advisable for me to set her up with my bro, knowing that she’s probably going to end up very frustrated with my brother’s lack of desire to do anything? I also wouldn’t want to make things difficult for my brother if he really enjoys his reclusive lifestyle.

96663,"Am I an asshole for scolding my bf for selling investment plans to my parents?So my bf has been an insurance agent/financial planner before we even got together, and I'm supportive of his career choice. We've been together for slightly over a year and we've met each other's parents a couple of times already. Still, he has only met my parents about 5 times since we only meet up as a family for gatherings like someone's birthday or CNY.My bf had told me that he wanted to sell insurance/investment plans to my parents and I said no, because I didn't want my parents to think badly of him. You know, the stigma around insurance agents/financial planners. Then, I just found out that he sold an investment plan to my parents. He waited for me to leave the house to settle some errands and then talked my parents into buying the plan.Thing is, the plan looks absolutely horrible. My parents have to pay 50k a year for 5 years. They will then get a lump sump back at the end of the 5 years with interest. My parents are retired, and they have about 300k in cash savings. This means they have to set aside 250k in their bank to pay for these 5 years, which means this plan is locking their retirement money which could be put in some other investment plans/stocks. This also means that they only have 50k to spend for the next 5 years which I think is definitely not enough. I feel like this plan is more suited for people who are still drawing an income and can set aside 50k a year to save, and not for people with the actual cash in hand now in retirement. If anything, they should be buying a plan that dumps 250k in now, then withdrawing X amount a year instead.Now my parents are quite happy with the plan, saying that it has a good interest and all, and my bf is happy that he earned the commission and has somewhat gained respect from my parents as a financial planner. My parents are really not financially literate and the money they have now is from their lifetime of saving. They do not have much cpf because they were self employed (small provision shop). I have not told my parents how stupid this plan is because I'm afraid they'd start to hate my bf or they'd just not trust me, but I feel like it is my duty to protect my parents' interest. Also, they are very stubborn and I feel like I will not be able to convince them to cancel the plan.There's still time to cancel the plan without any fees but I'm in a real dillema now... My bf is disagreeing that this plan is stupid, and he said my parents have the right to invest in whatever they want without my approval, and he emphasized that they are happy with it. What should I do? I've told him to bring up cancelling the plan instead else I'd do it instead and he said I'm putting him in a spot.-#96663: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96663","['Like: 109 people', 'Angry: 98 people', 'Haha: 28 people']",273 comments,95 shares

Sometimes I feel that life is essentially made up of challenges, obstacles, and situations that help to determine my role within it. These past couple years, while I keep on trying to find a certain type of happiness within life, I keep encountering situations that seem to suggest to me otherwise, that the time has not come for me to attain that yet. I really cherish the friendships that I have forged over the years and I will always remain grateful for them  Now, after all this time, I feel that my path has been becoming clearer and clearer: To help my friends attain the happiness that they deserve and to always be happy and there for them once that have achieved it. Even though I can't seem to possess what they have, I should and always remain by their side and help them to greater heights while I hide my present emotions. As each day passes, this role gets clearer and clearer. Deep down in my heart, I still hope that one day, I will be able to experience what they had.

I am naturally someone who likes to keep myself busy and I would prefer to be stressed over being busy than stressed over being too free. My appraisal will be coming up and I really do not know what to even write in my appraisal letter, because I feel like I have not contributed to much except the work that has been given to me, which are mostly not important. This is not a troll post, am sincerely looking for real career advice. Prof Ben, do you have any advice too?

96633,"I chose to work in a school to support education. I take great effort and commitment in everything I do for my students. Listening and understanding their concerns, observing their learning process and how I could add on and enhance. Always trying to do that extra as long as it benefits the students (especially with the Covid affecting everyone's learning and personal lives)At one point of time, at the peak of my 'career', I was so happy and proud of what I am doing, because I see how my actions impact the students, the positive effects I am able to create. But within the recent few months, I faced so many setbacks and problems by my peers. I'm just one lone individual and I don't get to make a lot of decisions. With so much opposition undermining my life. I'm reduced to a pathetic state that while I still want to do my best for my students (which I still continue to try), I don't know what I am 'working' now.Since I can't get any support or assistance, guess the only thing I could do behind anonymity is.. 'help'. Am I 'ranting'? Was I really expecting help to come online from unknown sources?

96632,"Hi, just want to share cuz this has been bothering me for a long time. I’m in my mid-20s, and have loved my guy best friend for many years. We were introduced by my ex bf who’s his friend, and got closer cuz we went to the same poly and spent a lot of time together. I don’t know whether he ever had romantic feelings for me back, cuz he admits he treats me specially (delivering free bubble tea to my work & home, sending me home, picking me up after drinking etc). He also introduced me to his parents & some of his close friends to try to help me open up & meet new ppl. When I talked to his friends, most of them tell me they suspect he has feelings for me but he won’t admit cuz of the special way he only treats me and shares his secrets with me. He also still brings me to his meetups with friends and work gatherings, we support each other emotionally and go out a lot though he is busy with work.While he rejected me a few years back when I confessed to him, we both stayed single since then. I’ve tried going on dating apps but it never worked out cuz I know I still have feelings for him. I think he’s tried dating too but he says he has no time & interest now cuz of his job. He claims he sees me as a younger sister that’s why we’re so close and he takes care of me. We both don’t talk about romance tho we’re very comfortable with each other and can talk abt anything else having long convos every day. I don’t dare mention dating cuz I’m scared to ruin our strong friendship. So I need to ask advice, what should I do now?

96629,"I just got out of a year-long relationship in the most bizarre manner. A week ago, my ex and I were watching movies in my car. Things got steamy and we started to make out, she aroused me as well by touching my groin. Eventually, we had s**. When it was time to go home, I playfully teased her when I helped to dress her. Next, she accused me of having no consent aka sexual assault. I tried to explain and apologise but she would not hear any of it. In the end, I dropped her off at her house. She did not respond to my calls nor messages after a day and eventually said not to meet up anymore (breakup). I accepted it and moved on albeit heartbroken and flabbergasted.A few days later, she texted me asking me to meet up and I asked for what purpose but she said nvm and blocked me on every online platform. Today, a friend of my ex accused me of having no consent and is blaming me for sexual assault. It has taken a toll on my mental health and has made me extremely fearful of having another relationship. Now, it is possible that my ex may even go to the extent of filing a sexual assault police report against me. Should I seek legal advice from a lawyer?-#96629: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96629","['Like: 53 people', 'Wow: 22 people', 'Sad: 20 people']",94 comments,19 shares

96611,"Attached to a loving boyfriend who I know for certain is in love with me and cares for me. He’s a good person too and we have a very peaceful relationship. However, some part of me wonders if that’s enough. I had an interest in the past who I had a unique connection with, where we were always in sync and could connect over anything and everything. Other than just sharing very similar life values, we had very similar thought processes and worldviews which made it easy for him to understand the life trajectory I’m on and why I make certain choices in life. While it’s not like I want to return to this past interest, I just wonder what is enough in a long term relationship. Often, I see people say that love (feelings) is not enough if there is no effort. What if the effort is there but we are just not fundamentally in sync? For eg, maybe sharing about some things, I know he will support me and encourage me but he does not share the same thoughts and may not understand why I choose to do certain things. I want the r/s to work and I’m grateful to have such a good person in life - and that’s why I want to be sure that this will not become an issue in the future, or perhaps I’m just looking for some wise words to dissuade me from constantly thinking about that one sync connection that I know a part of me craves.

96609,It’s been more than 6 months since my first and only boyfriend dumped me and I’m still suffering from it. I’ve since gone out on some dates with some guys but I stopped seeing them after the second date max because I felt like nothing could compare to my ex boyfriend. I still wake up everyday hoping he’ll change his mind and text me to tell me that he’s sorry and that he wants me back. How do I get rid of this mindset? He dumped me because I was ready to get married but he said he wanted to date more girls. We’d dated for almost 4 years. It really hurt because I had already mapped out an entire future with him. I don’t know if I can ever move on from this?

96603,"Recently my ex-boyfriend broke up with me and I really find him extremely unfair to me. We’ve been together for almost 4 years, just a few months before we hit our 4th anniversary, but he decided to end things with me because of this fxxking covid-19 issue.Ever since we are allowed to hangout and dine-out after 2 months of lockdown last year, things began to change. He hates hangout out and waiting for long queues. Because all eateries have to practise safe social distancing, so restaurant, cafes, and even hawker centres and foodcourts can’t accommodate full house dining, so like 50% of the tables are empty, therefore people have to queue outside. Just imagine popular places like ding tai fung already have long queue before covid-19, now it’s just getting worse. My ex has very bad patience, so whenever we hung out, he got very frustrated whenever we had to queue, and there were many times we ended up eating at less popular eateries that we don’t even like. Even at foodcourts also we had a hard time finding a table. It’s like everywhere we go, be it shopping mall or restaurants outside, there will always be a queue, so he just got sick of waiting.My ex is quite fit, I would say he is a gym junkie who workout 5-6 days a week. Even on days when I just want to chill and rest at home, he would go to the gym too since we can’t meet. Although he is muscular, he also does cardio activities like cycling, HIIT and jogging. But he dislikes wearing a mask because it gives him breathing difficulty. I know this sounds ridiculous because my friends and I who don’t even gym or exercise have no problem hanging out with mask on, but when I saw him sweating so much, face turning red, and gasping for air when we hung out, I feel guilty for hanging out with him. He told me that he doesn’t like to hangout anymore because wearing mask just makes him difficult to breathe. Even after trying different masks, it’s still the same, he doesn’t seem to be able to breathe normally. Another problem is when he gets hot and stuffy, his mood would turn bad too, so those happy meet-ups actually turned out to be moody and sad.As he can no longer accept this kind of dating lifestyle, he initiated to breakup with me. He said given this fxxked up covid-19 situation, all he wants is just to stay at home and just takeaway simple food nearby his place during weekend. I’m actually fine with it too because I know this is not gonna be permanent, but he feels that this so-called new normal is not going to end anytime soon, and we are expected to be masked on for at least a few years, so he doesn’t want to waste my time.Enough of ranting, I just hope you guys can give me some advice on how I should approach him because I really want to patch back and be with him again.

In fact I did have feelings for my very close friend since secondary school, but he told me he just see me as a friend. Even he behave as usual around me,like there's no problem with that. When I'm the one that have to hold back myself and feelings whenever we met, as he just behave as usual like he always does around me. Being all that good,friendly and kind to me, and I'm the stupid one that trying to have hopes on that. I did try my very best to get rid of this feelings, but whenever i managed to do so, his messages are the ones that stopped me from it. As I said, the way he treated me is so kind,good and friendly, in fact he treats me very well. Like how can someone not have hopes or think differently when the guy she likes, treat you like that or even better compared to the time when i haven't confessed my feelings towards him? I am now trying very hard again to get rid of this feelings, by keeping myself very busy at work and doing something that i like. I just hope that i can 100% moved on from this. I know it's hard, but i just can't keep on being like this as I don't want to lose this friendship with him too. The part for me to let go that feelings i have for him is just so hard. ????

96596,"Why can't we have more than 1 wife legally if both girls are alright with it? I was initially in a relationship with this girl. One day she confessed that she was actually bi and she had an itch to scratch. I was shocked but I decided to let her scratch. She was afraid so she asked me to be with her throughout the process. After a string of rejections on dating apps, we found someone for her who understood our situation. I wanted to distance myself from this to let her have her fun but she insisted that I come along. We met and had a couple of drinks. My gf insisted that I follow them to her house. They started scratching each other's itch. Suddenly, the other girl asked me to join and who would refuse. I initially thought that it would just be a one time thing. The three of us met again to scratch our itch again and again and again. Before we know, the three of us had caught feelings for each other. We did movies together and dinner dates like couples, all three of us. The other girl suggested that I should bto with my first girlfriend and then, the three of us can live together. I asked that legally it would be a disadvantage to her but she said that it would be the only way to circumvent the legal part. The only world where allowing marriage of more wives is possible if the market has a higher demand which then forces it to become a law.

96594,"Rant post here: Having been married with my wife for more than 7 years, had two kids, our precovid years prior were more or less happy and satisfactory although not entirely smooth sailing. Due to covid and issues at her workplace, my wife quit her job and she starts to have doubts in the marriage. Minus off all the details and complicated stuffs, we decided to go open relationship to maybe bring some sparks and life to our own lives and marriage as well. The bottom line is even if we have puppy love with outside lovers, the spouse and family comes first. She initiated this arrangement with video chat with others first, then into irl meet ups. Of course I wasn't initially happy with this arrangement but she wasn't feeling happy no matter what and I thought by doing this she would be happy. How I've erred. The current bf she's with initially I've met with him as well and I was OK with how she described him as a person with a sense of justice and positivity. I've should have known a person who's willing to sleep with others wife even if she's in an open relationship wouldn't have these traits. Before long, he started to ask her to divorce me, even though he doesn't like kids, he's willing to take care. He even mentioned to her he's willing to sell of his assets to take care of them. It was also after that my wife found out he's inheriting tens of millions from his deceased stepfather.During the whole process my wife's hinted that she had fallen in love with him, and it was never about the money. Then came the most selfish and heartbreaking moment I've experienced in my life. On the day of my birthday, she told me she had wanted to arrange for some nice starvation event for us but since I've arranged already she never went through(she never even mentioned it before aNyway till that day). Then she told me she wanted to divorce amicably.... I was devastated, who in the right mind would say such things on a person's birthday. After we talked it out, she says she will head to the bf side to talk things out and try to break it off. In the end, she only went back to our room late in the morning.... With love bites all over her body that she purposefully asked her bf to plant... And suddenly the entire marriage there wasn't anything I did right and all the things she did was not wrongIn the end, I told her if she want to divorce, she can pack her bags and leave the house immediately. I will also cease all the money that I give her and pays for her. Yup, during this whole time she was also using the money I gave her while unemployed to go out with her bf. After a series talks, we agreed to break off any arrangements we have outside of marriage after a month. In this month I wouldn't care about what she does. But... The betrayal and the hints that she gave... Makes me doubtful she will entirely break off, even if she really does breaks off, if it's just me who wants to fix out marriage but she doesn't want to put in the effort to fix our marriage, I do not see the future as being happy. Now I'm at a dilemma to whether to divorce and fight for the care and control of my kids, or try to trust her and fix the marriage. I do have some friends who advice just let the judge decide and if she takes the care and control, let her n her bf take care while I go free and single. But for me my main concern is I want my children to have a whole loving family that neither of us have (she says her bf family is really loving and is the kind she's looking for, unlike my family whose dysfunctional as compared to a normal family).-#96594: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96594","['Like: 14 people', 'Sad: 13 people', 'Wow: 5 people']",22 comments,2 shares

It just sounds like you are lazy and does not seek self improvement. Times are changing. Ladies are working and earning their keep. They dont need atms, but a emotionally mature individual who can support each other. But they still get the short end most of the time. As for why ladies may still go for the traditional patriarchal route of being the ""lesser"" earner.... well keep that insecurities and ego in check and confidence up if you dont want to unconciously end up on the wrong side of statistics.

96584,"Advice needed!! Currently I'm in a 2-year master programme in urban planning, and studio work takes up a huge portion of the curriculum. There is this girl who always free rides and I've grouped with her for studio twice already. Last semester I accepted fate, but this semester I'm really angry that it's still group grading for this 8 mcs mod, and it's just super unfair to us. In the first few weeks of the semester, when our studio group was having discussions, she always talked about useless things such as ""the other day I did something"", or she would only say ""ok"" or ""I tried but it's too hard to find what y'all want..."". Then these weeks she attended our group meetings, but she was there just to do other things!! She did her individual assignments, she was chatting with friends, she was even shopping online... Then we cannot tolerate her anymore, so my friend went to talk to her, asked her if she could keep up and if she could contribute to our studio work. Still, she talked about some useless stuff, trying to make it our fault that we always agree with each other so she doesn't want to speak up (actually the rest of us argue against each other a lot on studio). Nothing has changed even after we talked to her.So we reached out to the TA for help, see if there's anything the tutors of the studio can do. Then we were told that this stupid studio is still group grading (but the tutors said it's indiv grading at the beginning). We asked for a peer evaluation for indiv grading, but the TA said the tutors think peer review is biased and they don't want it. I was like:????? Last sem was zoom lesson so I can understand indiv grading is quite hard as they can't really observe each person's contribution. Then this sem they meet us every week for a whole day, they still say it's difficult to observe? The whole class can tell the girl is free riding, but they can't???Our group has been doing quite good for the studio since the beginning, and I think our grade is not gonna be bad. It's just so unfair that the freeloader can share the grade as what we've been putting effort into, and she literally did NOTHING. I'm so angry now, and we tried everything we can do. The tutors are just lazy to deal with this thing. I didn't meet any professors and lecturers like this during my 4-year undergrad in NUS. Now I know the tutors in master programme in NUS are so irresponsible... We just want an individual grade that is fair to everyone................. What should I and my group do now? I want to email the programme director for this thing but I don't know if I should do it....

We do not meet every single week or rather, the frequency is pretty irregular, due to her studies and my commitments.We usually meet up for a meal to hang out and she would offer to drive around too. She had already caught my attention when I first met her which was the reason why we remained in contact after that first encounter. It was after texts and time spent together that got us knowing each other better. But I know she just treats me as a friend. Confessed to her once and.. yup u know what happened. Let’s just call my crush dinosaur. She would often asks me for advice as what she should do because she liked a particular guy. Sometimes I wished she was hinting that it’s me, but it’s not. Lol.After confession, things went back to normal and as if nothing happened. After that period I started hanging out with this colleague and things didn’t went really well. Meanwhile, Dinosaur and I at that period of time was rather quiet and didn’t hung out as much as before too. We were both busy with our own lives. But we were aware of what we were going on with. Eventually I broke things off with the girl.Honestly I really liked dinosaur but I knew both of us are kinda impossible. I had good impression of her, goods feelings but tried to not fall deep into it because I know both of us are likely going nowhere, judging from the questions she asked me before. To cover up the fact that I’ve gotten over her, ill often pop questions like ways to ask a girl out or whatever it is to cover up my feelings for her. I didn’t want things to turn awkward. There was once she asked in a rather timid manner about how are things going between me and the girl, and I just said it’s over. She gave me the impression that she’s wanting to try, maybe I’m thinking too much. When we hung out, i really felt we were a couple, except without holding of hands, lol.I know I’ve kinda screwed things up. But sometimes the questions she asks me makes me feel like I’ve a chance. We’ve been hanging out together, Idk if u would even call it a date. We are good now and idw to make things awkward if i were to pop any question to ask if we are really just close friends, or there’s a chance of becoming of than friends.

Basically we were playing game everyday ever since we talked, and we can be in the same call for almost 10hours or more. So slowly i developed feelings for her and decided to just confess. Then slowly we became closer and closer and sometimes i will go to her house. Even though like it was quite far but i just went. So here's the thing. Last time when we just started talking she'll stay online to maybe text for 10-20 mins max. But now we when text, at most is 1-2 text then she'll go offline and reply maybe 5mins later. But now whenever i see that she is able to reply others instant but not me it just felt really depressing. And she told me that she don't reply instant but after those incident (still happening) idk what i should even feel about it. Now that we've gotten closer, and we started playing with our friends, most of the time she'll ask me to call them instead of like last time where the call will be just the two of us. We even spoke about jealously this matter and what i don't really like. I just don't know how to react to these situations.

96537,"After 6 years working in public service, I feel stagnant and interest in my work has nosedived. I think many of my peers feel the same way and we wonder if we should make a career switch into the private sector. Especially with the hypergrowth of the tech industry, FOMO is real and we fear that this would be our last chance to try jumping out to the private sector, before age catches up in our thirties. While we are thankful to have a stable job, we also wonder if there is more to life than being a servant of the bureaucracy.I have seen many public servants toiling at the same job for decades. Many stay on because of the stability, but most of them have grown jaded and resentful, simply because the sense of stagnation has eaten away at them. To all those who have faced this crossroads before - should I take a gamble and make a switch now to the private sector, or should I just stick it out and find opportunities in the service? I have no debt and no kids at this point in time, so financially I have some leeway. However, moving also entails losing out on career progression in the service (simply by virtue of seniority). My interest is in tech and data analytics. While there is huge demand for this in the private sector, the competition is also intense and I worry about job prospects and stability. I have honed my skills through constant self-practice but I’m now at a stage where I find it hard to improve further without learning from the industry. The public service doesn’t seem to prioritise / offer as much opportunities for growth in these areas and I wonder if I will regret not pursuing my interest now.Would appreciate any advice plz  Prof Ben Leong, would love to hear your thoughts too!-#96537: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96537","['Like: 65 people', 'Care: 8 people']",47 comments,3 shares

96533,"Dating/ thoughts - please give me your opinionsI’ve graduated 5 years ago now, and I just thought I’d share my thoughts as someone nearing his 30s. It’s funny.. I’ve fallen in love with a few girls in my life, and every single one of them chose to be with a f boy instead. I’m boring, I study a lot, though I do maintain a healthy lifestyle and exercise twice a week. Their relationships never lasted more than 6 months, and then they would come crying to me after, and whenever I thought I’d have a chance, the next fboy comes along and they leave again (note we didn’t officially get together, just that they would text me all the time for consolation, their problems what not, I’ll buy them meals to cheer them up, deliver them to their door at night when they wanted to) then the messages die down, and before I realize, they were already together with another fboy for a few weeks. I’d leave the toxic “friendship” and meet someone else and somehow the process repeats. I don’t know what to do anymore, and I don’t understand why these girls I’ve met have constantly chosen the obviously bad alternative and continue to do, even as they are near to their 30s too now. With the exception of one of them who got knocked up and is now married, but now her husband is allegedly having an affair because she just texted me 2 days ago asking how I’ve been and she started telling me all her current problems again.. what should I do?-#96533: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96533","['Like: 23 people', 'Haha: 17 people', 'Care: 5 people']",61 comments,8 shares

96522,"I graduated from uni last year and had struggled for months before finally managing to secure a full-time job given the poor job market. A recent revelation from my parents got me feeling pretty shitty about myself.For context, my parents run a very small business but I never knew much about it. One day I was just curious to know how long their only employee has been working and her salary. Turns out that while her monthly salary is about 2+k/month since her highest qualification was just 'O' Levels, the amount of annual bonus my parents give to her is such that her monthly takeaway is actually equivalent to someone earning 4+k/month! In contrast, I am drawing out just 2.8k/month at my current job which I accepted out of desperation being unemployed after graduation for several months.I can't help but feel like a loser right now and plenty of regrets certainly came to mind. And before anyone starts asking, no. My parents won't take me into their business, nor do I intend to work for my parents because it is not something I can do and they intend to retire soon anyway. I'm not really seeking any advice out here as I know that I need to seek better job opportunities as the market slowly recovers, which is what I will do.

I wasn't really bothered about it though because the time we had the conversation I'm sure our combined salary is more than enough to have a decent living.I feel he is a very driven person, like he doesn't complain when his work requires him to travel almost every week (and can always mention something funny from his work), he is actively taking financial certificate, asked me genuine questions about programming and SQL. He claimed that he feels a guy should earn more than a girl otherwise it will make him feel less of a man.Even though I feel abit sad then, but I accepted it and we both have found our own happiness now.

Always smiling, treats people with kindness and respect, no matter their backgroundSure, after an hour or two, he tires out and just fades away in the group conversation tho I think it's cute. However, he doesn't have any relationship experience before and has low self-esteem. The funny thing he is tall and actually good looking.Everytime someone in our circle ask to introduce him to some girls, he just laughs it off and reply about how he's going to have no chance and remain single his own life and I don't understand why. The way he texts is vastly different from the way he talks, maybe it's his inner voice?And I don't think he is well to do because he has financial aid for his studies and wear similar clothes on a weekly basis.So I talked to his closest friends and they said he was often bullied. He was also held back a year in secondary school. They just regrettably said he was beyond his years.I really like him A LOT as he is my type and am dying to confess but with what I have seen so far, it's like his heart is not there.

96507,"To the OP of #96393:I was actually in a very similar position to you a while back. I was interested in a guy and decided to actively pursue him. he realised I was interested and told me that he wasn’t looking for a rs then, so I accepted that and we continued to hang out. things got very messy when clearly he was also interested in me but holding back from making things official because of certain concerns that we would not be compatible for the long term. I was definitely very hurt by his indecisiveness and unclear stance. it was only after many long talks (I brought up what I was feeling to him) that we decided to try things out (dating, though the way we were acting was like we were in a rs for a long time before we decided this). there were many many things to work out between us (resolved over the course of months, definitely with big ups and downs) but we’re together officially and in a pretty good place rn. I would suggest you really talk things out with him and explain your feelings (you don’t know his rationale for such actions either). if he makes it clear he’s not interested, it would be much easier on yourself to give clear boundaries on how you should act around each other eg. maybe give a longer break inbetween meeting up, keep physical contact at a minimum, only say things to him via text or irl that you would say to any regular guy friend. basically treat him exactly as you would any of your other guy friends, and make sure he treats you similar to how they (yr guy friends) would treat you. niceness is one thing but its not going to help in your situation. it does take time for your mindset to switch and it doesnt help at all when both parties actions make it fuzzy.finally, know that you certainly deserve someone willing to take a definite chance on you! and that you are strong enough to deal with whatever happens. good luck! -#96507: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96507","['Like: 18 people', 'Love: 1 person', 'Care: 1 person']",0 Comments,3 shares
96505,"Dear #96393,Reading your confession and all the comments/advice that came with it was really helpful, and made me feel less alone. I think I found it really striking that there are so many similarities to what I've been going through - or maybe I just feel so desperate and alone that I'm drawing up links to whatever I can.Like you, I've spent the last eight months pining over a guy I cannot have. Like you, I don't have anyone I can talk to about this. Except he was the one who confessed and chased me, and the reason I haven't been able to talk to anyone about this is so I can protect his identity. Long story short, he is not someone available to me, and even despite the confessing and chasing from his end, he has made it abundantly clear that we can never be together, that he'll never be able to choose me. The words have been laid down from the beginning in black and white, and never mind that he was the one who initiated this, who pursued this, but he was also the one who refused to let go, to let me move on. Maybe it was hard for him too, because I know his feelings were real, and he was constantly battling between his heart and mind. But the truth is what it is, and the mixed signals were really tiring - he would be saying one thing, but doing the complete opposite.  Every time I thought I could move on, he would suddenly resurface in my life again, and I would get dragged back into the same cycle, over and over again. He completely messed with my mind - I was so exhausted, not just physically (from not being able to sleep), but also emotionally and mentally. Not to say I blame him - in reality, I'm to blame too, because I could easily put my foot down and cut him off, even if he shows up once again. But it was hard, I won't deny... when his words hurt me I think there's no reason to hold on, and then he shows up and his eyes and actions say something else. Then there're also the times when his words are everything I want to hear, but his actions cut me to the core. Or sometimes everything is in sync, and then suddenly, something happens and he awakens to reality/has a sudden realization, and then once again, everything is not. I don't know which is worse - not having your feelings returned, or having your feelings returned but knowing you'll never be able to be together. To be honest, I also have a general sense of feeling cheated, because why even stir up these feelings if you know you'll never be able to give me anything? And if you know you can't give me anything, why not let me move on?? He kept giving me mixed signals - in both words and actions. He tells me to move on and find my own happiness, but every time it seems like I'm moving on, he holds on even more, and then he'll say or do something and all of a sudden I'm back at that same spot once again. I've cried all the tears there is to cry, over the past eight months. At first it was every day, sometimes multiple times a day, but now I don't even cry anymore- I'm just numb. I've learnt that life still goes on even if you're desperately sad, that you can still function. Is that a sign of healing? Right now we're in this pocket of space where we haven't talked for awhile, as agreed - will it last this time? Do I honestly want it to? It would be so easy to just go back to that time and place, to that space where you forget everything and everyone else. So easy to just cave... Honestly, that would make me very happy, even if it's just hearing his voice or seeing him again, but deep down I know that that's just short term happiness, because it would just mean even more pain in the long run once again. Sometimes I confuse even myself...But I think eventually I realized that even if both parties feel the same, it doesn't matter if the other party isn't willing to fight for you. You don't need to wonder about the reasons why - why it can't work, why you have to let go, why the other person is doing this, what the other person can possibly be thinking or feeling. In the end, if they're not going to fight for you, then you have to be the one to walk away. That's the rational side of me speaking. As you can see, my mind and heart are in constant battles with each other too. But let's both walk away. I hope we're both able to. (I'm so sorry if this is all over the place, but understand that it's eight months worth of pent up emotions and thoughts. I hope you feel better soon. And everyone, if you can just give some advice / constant reminder of what I should do, please do. I'll be so grateful for any little encouragement, because in all honestly, this is really hard, and there's no one I can talk to or confide in, no one who can whack some sense into me. And I'm so afraid I'll cave once again, because really, that'll be so easy to do.)-#96505: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96505","['Like: 9 people', 'Care: 5 people']",7 comments,2 shares

It pains me so much to try to walk away from you..you are starting to make me see what true love might look like. What did I ever do.. for you to love me so much? You just make me lose my words sometimes. Why do you keep showering me with affection? Why me?I am scared to even speak to you, I am scared I might fall in love with you. I don’t want to. What if things don’t work out in the long run? I am not ready to lose you and this friendship. I am scared to reciprocate.I don’t even mind me getting hurt, but I will definitely not do anything to cause you pain. This is the least I could do after all the affection you have shown me. You might think I have forgotten all the things you have done for me in all these years.. but really, never ever will I forget! You are as precious to me as I am to you. The first time we spoke many years back, I definitely felt something different about you. I have never told you this, but I knew you were not any other random guy I would come across. At that point, I didn’t think of it as a liking of those sorts but I liked your presence at the very least. Still remember the last time I met you tho. I think it was at a bus interchange haha, it was a coincidental meet. It was a quick few minutes of talk that we had, but is still a good memory on my mind. Seems very nostalgic now. And then, when we got in touch, I liked this friendship and you as a friend..I still do. You haven’t told me this directly but I know. I know you have a lot of love for me. I am scared everytime I come in contact with you..scared you might ask me if I reciprocate your love. Now, I have started to create a small distance between us but I really hope you don’t think it is because I hate you or whatsoever. This distance is for us to not feel as hurt if we have to part ways eventually. You don’t understand how much it pains me to even say this. There is a lot of fear in me with this friendship and the uncertainty about the future. I don’t even know if I am doing the right thing by creating a distance between us. I wish I could make this situation better..Any opinions or advice on this situation is greatly appreciated.-#96502: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96502","['Like: 23 people', 'Care: 8 people', 'Sad: 5 people']",16 comments,10 shares

96500,"TL;DR — Bf (26M) did some shady shit that broke my (23M) trust, I am not so sure of our relationship anymore. Known and got together with my current boyfriend for less than a year. 3 months into our relationship, bf went to meet online bff (female) for dinner — told me was supposedly 3 pax but last person went MIA. I didn’t feel right in my gut but tried to be understanding. I couldn’t hide being upset, voiced out and he came over to my place to talk things out. At this point my mentality was “you came because you did something wrong and now you feel guilty”. Anyway, this was resolved the same night. I found out earlier this month this was false. The dinner was planned with only both of them in mind right from the start. I didn’t voice this out to him since it’s long over so I’m penning it down here. It really fucking sucks to know about this lol. Next, on the same day when I found out about the above, I also found that my bf and this guy (whom he only knows for less than 3 months) were talking about/planning to go to sleazy massage parlours in Feb. THIS I obviously could not keep mum about this because what the fuck????  We talked about this and came to a conclusion: for obvious reasons he will cut off contact with him. Of course, my bf also had to work on himself for whatever he said to the guy, or for even entertaining it. I gave him the benefit of doubt based on the timeline of response which was also his defense — he was merely entertaining the guy and tried to respond at odd intervals so it doesn’t ever pan out. (Conversation ends early March, no texts to one another) Now, although the situation above has been resolved, I have been deeply affected by it. Before this, I trusted him wholeheartedly. Now, I find myself doubting and wondering if he is actually hanging out with whoever he says he is with (even with telegram short videos) and what he is doing. From the start, He does things to show that he loves me, tells me that, gives me reassurance and what not. We were even planning our future and started saving together (no joint account, just our money in my bank). So for this to happen, you could say I was pretty mind fucked. I couldn’t process it lol because I was so confused. I am not experienced in a relationship and consider him to be my first, so I don’t know if I should continue being with him and rebuild back the trust I had while working on our future together.-#96500: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96500","['Like: 18 people', 'Haha: 12 people', 'Care: 4 people']",55 comments,10 shares

Like we used to hang out everyday and now he just wants to hang out with his friends and he goes out alone to arcades and stuff and tbh every time he does that I get a lil insecure cause that's what he told me that time, that he was going to go out to buy something, before disappearing an entire day... Not sure how to react anymore, this is the third big drama we had in the few months we were tgt (first being that his mom found something in his phone she wasn't supposed to, then second being that his ex contacted me to tell me he was on okc) and like he claimed to be clean and that he didn't text any other girls besides friendly chatter but he gave me access to his tele and I saw him talking about nsfw stuff? Not sure if it matters but the reason he gave me for cheating was that he didn't want to keep guilting me into ""satisfying"" him every time we had a sleep over (which he did regularly before this) and like because I didn't really feel ready to give up my v card just yet. Honestly I just feel really tired right now, and yeah that's what he says when I try to talk to him about it too - that he's tired and doing his best. I don't really want to give up this rs cause beside all this, he had a lot of good points. So I'm kinda just really lost right now, while he goes off and has fun with his friends and whatnot. Just kinda feels unfair that imo I always did my best and to be fair he used to too, but right now it just feels like I'm the only one clinging to the relationship while he just says he never stopped caring but it just feels otherwise. Just a rant I suppose, he'll probably know it's me since he subscribes to the Telegram group but meh..

96487,"23F and just got attached to a longtime friend I've known for about 10 years in close circles. We've been dating for close to a year and having known each other for so long, are already talking about our ideal BTO age, houses and whatnot. We've also met each other families a few times and are people who can talk to each other about anything. We've agreed to talk things out on the same day it happens to prevent issues from coming up when you keep problems to yourself.However, during the past 10 years, we've both dated and met different people before getting with each other. I personally have a very low self esteem and compare myself to his exes, and when I do, it just sits at the back of my head and I become very anxious. I've brought this up to my bf a few times and he never fails to comfort and assure me that we're in this relationship with the intention to have a future together and I'm extremely thankful for that.Sometimes, I just overthink again and I'm sick of doubting him. Struggling with anxiety, I've been going to a therapist to help me through it and my bf has also been very supportive. My mind just runs sometimes and overthink a lot. I'm confident that he will provide me with comfort and assurance anytime I feel inadequate, but i would love to be able to get his love through my thick ass skull.What can I do to get over my feeling of inadequacy?-#96487: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96487","['Like: 20 people', 'Care: 6 people', 'Sad: 3 people']",20 comments,3 shares

I went around asking people for one and they just shook their heads perfunctorily, telling me they did not have an extra one. However, after asking this guy, who came a little later, for help, he graciously and attentively went around the bus stop asking others if they had an extra mask on them and handed me over one someone else had passed him.

96474,"This is a long story- prepare yourself :))A lil introduction here, I am a 21F and my ex is 21M.So, i just broke up with my bf of 4 and a half years. we have known each other since 2014 and have been texting each other everyday since. he asked me to be his girlfriend for 2 years before i fell in love and gave in. he were there for me at every moment of my life, especially bringing me out from depression years ago, promising that he will never hurt me ever. this is the first serious relationship we both had. during our relationship, everything was rocky, we had a lot of ups and downs, on and off relationship but we still stayed until now. he had emotionally cheated on me once in the beginning of our relationship, it had impacted our relationship so much until last year, where i put down the past and stop blaming him for that. Last year, we broke up again and he told me he didn’t love me anymore. after a while, we got back together and everything was fine. i even thought that ever since december last year, everything was perfect. i thought this was our best year yet and we are gonna have a future together. until february 2021, he and his female best friend which i will call A got really close because she broke up with her boyfriend and she was leaning to my bf for support and advices. i know her personally and she is very much in love and loyal to her bf. but they got really close to the point he stayed up till midnight to call with her listening to her cry and complaining even though he have work in the next morning. they even went out for drinks with another friend frequently. they text almost daily and he replies her instantly too. at this point, i got fed up and a lil jealous of their relationship even tho i know they are just friends. so me and him fought about her for a while and took a break. after a day, he msg me and told me that he is tired of our breaks and asked me if we will have a future tgt. then we met up the next day and he told me that he’s tired of our relationship and he felt everything was different since 2019. he told me he wanna break up with me, so i asked him to reconsider as i really love him despite we fight a lot. he then told me to wait until 2nd of april and he will give me an answer. i agreed, but the next day he came to find me after drinking and told me that everything he said the previous night was a joke and said it was a lesson for me to not say break up so easily everytime we fight. i then believed him and we got back together. then 2 days later, we went out for dinner. when we reached my house gate, i told him that i wanna spend more time tgt as it has been a long time since we get some quality time together. he then told me he’s really tired and he really wanna go home. i then complained and fought about him and A’s relationship. he kept quiet the whole time and it was only me who’s shouting. he kept giving me cold replies like ok, i wanna go back, whatever. obviously i got even more angry and heated. at the same time, it was the first day of my period so i was a lil crazy. he then snapped and said he wanna break up for real this time. then only i realise the seriousness of his break up. then we went home, he told me the truth that everything he said 2 days ago was fake and he really wanted a breakup but he felt bad and gave it another try. but after seeing me fighting and shouting at him today, he said he can’t do it anymore. then i wrote a long essay and list to compile the problems we have in the relationship and how to fix them and told him i am very serious about fixing our relationship and changing this time. i also apologised for all the bad behaviour and for that day. then he told me to give him a week to reconsider his decision which is until today. during this week, he followed the girl where he emotionally cheated on me before on instagram, followed few other girls and deleted our pictures on his account. i felt horrible and crushed as i know his answer will still remain the same. today came and we met up. and yes as i expected his answer is still to breakup. reason is that he’s really tired of me and our relationship. he doesn’t wanna be in a relationship or do anything now he just wanna enjoy his life as a single person right now. he also admitted that he had a “hao gan” to his female best friend, A. “hao gan” is like a good impression but not necessarily have feelings. we discussed everything rationally today, there was no fighting or crying just now. so i agreed to his decision to break up today. i am really in despair and i really want him back as i really think we could have a good future. i am thinking of starting a no contact rule to get him back. is he gonna come back after i change into a more positive person? after being together for so long, it must be hard to get over someone. has anyone ever tried no contact with their ex bf and eventually their ex bf really came back? how long does it actually take? what advices do you have for me, please don’t just ask me to move on as i know i should and will be trying to while on no contact rule. thank you for reading until here. i really need some advices here!-#96474: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96474","['Like: 39 people', 'Care: 13 people', 'Haha: 12 people']",84 comments,18 shares
96472,"To #96417, been there in your place. I used to think that getting a girl friend would be awesome. It can be, but it also has a lot of cons. You would realize them later because you would find the perfect girl but you might still be unhappy.I had also not properly kissed a girl till I had graduated. And yes, kisses are great, especially when you are asked to close your eyes, you really dunno what to expect and you get the first kiss. But having a girlfriend is very troublesome too.Eventually, you would want to live together. Cuddling is great for a few minutes but it gets really sweaty and uncomfortable after a few mins. Your girlfriend might not like that you like to play games. You have to be considerate and turn off the lights when she wants to sleep at night. She would like to have meals with you and maybe you like your meals with Netflix.I know you would think these are small cons, and you will not believe me that the above is more annoying than sleeping alone. Therefore, let me tell you this. You will be having many relationships. Keep swiping. Use all of Tinder, Bumble, happn, OkC & CMB and when you go running, swipe in between. Use your super likes etc. You will eventually match, you will go on dates, you will have a lot of sex, but at the end, you will realise it is a waste of time. The experiences are great, but the thrill does not match what you would experience if you built something or raised funding for your startup or received great reviews from a customer.You are beautiful. I was overweight, young (3 years younger than girls in my batch), from India (did not know many good bars or places to go) and did not have a good dressing sense. I was so noob that I literally asked permission to kiss and kisses are not great when the other person is laughing. You will have great relationships and then you will realise that what you wanted to do all along was be Elon Musk. Then you will set out on your real dream and change the world.-#96472: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96472","['Like: 31 people', 'Haha: 21 people']",8 comments,5 shares

I used to have a pretty good relation with the person i liked. We talked a lot as friends and shared a lot of laughters. Just that he was a popular guy, that is all. Is it because im slightly overweight and not pretty at all? I dont match up to him? That u people had to overly tease him to the extend that i didnt even get any replies from that said confession and we dont talk anymore. Making fun of me, photoshopping pictures of me and sending it around. Do u people think its funny? Even though it happened a few years ago, i have become afraid. Just thinking back on all these memories still makes me cry.  I have become too afraid to take the first step in forming a relationship with someone. Now i have another person i like, but i am too afraid to let my feelings be known so that we can just stay as friends.

96466,"Highly introverted girl here, 22F who needs advice in relationships and life in general. Recently I’ve gotten attached to a guy and it’s my first rs. I think my introversion has already been causing some issues. When I spend time with people, just anybody in general even with family and my closest friends, my energy and enthusiasm gets drained super fast. I can be enthusiastic and talk normally for the first couple of hours, but then my energy gets drained quickly and I’ll need to be alone for a long time to recharge. I went for a few dates with my bf and showed this behavior as well. He thought that I was depressed or he did smth wrong and doesn’t seem to get it even though I explained my condition. He is an introvert as well but his condition is not as serious as mine and he can spend time with people normally for hours. Also, I have to keep thinking of interesting and appropriate replies and topics when talking to him in person and texting, which tbh is an additional effort on top of other things I have in life such as studies and cca. I know it’s just the way I am and totally not his fault. I can’t imagine life if I were to get married and have to eat, breathe and sleep with someone 24/7 and idk if it’ll drive me crazy. I’ve thought of staying single for life and if I’ll be happier with that.

96465,"I’ve been in love with a girl for more than 5 years now. Have you ever been so in love with someone that you don’t want to have a relationship with anyone else, even if it means you will be single for the rest of your life? That’s how I feel about her.In the past 5 years, she has been in 2 relationships that ended badly. It was heartbreaking for me to see her put on a strong front, even though I knew she was dying inside. In those moments where I could sense how much anguish she was hiding underneath, all I wanted to do is to be a shoulder for her to lean on. I’ve been told that the purest form of love is when you just want her to be happy, and that’s the only thing I have ever wanted for her.I’m just an acquaintance. But I’m good friends with one of her best friends, through whom I have always asked about her (casually). As long as I have known her, she has been with someone. Even though I couldn’t bear seeing her with someone else, she appeared to be happy, and that was enough for me. She was always happy until she suddenly isn’t.She is pushing 30 now, and has now decided to take a step back from relationships and to focus on her career. She is happy again now, and I’m happy for her.My feelings for her has never changed since the moment I fell for her 5 years ago. I want to marry her and no one else. I want to be everything for her.As I have never dated anyone before, I am terrified and I don’t know how to approach her. After all, I have been in this relationship 5 years more than she has, and I don’t want to cause her more anxiety than she needs.

96442,So...... I dated girl X for 4 years before she decided to break up (2018) with me but wanted me to wait for her too. She told me that she believe we will eventually find each other again. In the process of we did not cut contact totally we would still be snap chatting each other to get the streak going till today (2021) She is in Uni (NTU) while I am serving Ns! During her days in Uni she was super close to this particular guy it was even seen as if they were a thing. Sometimes she would even mute me on her ig stories so I won’t see certain stories. When confronted she guaranteed they were nothing. NOTE: She was the one who told me to give her time and space to sort out her feelings. Many times after our breakup she would often give me false hope and mix signals. She do know that I still have feelings for her even till now. She was on dating apps (ss of her account was sent to me by a anonymous person definitely not catfish because the pics used are not found on her social media) not sure if she even dated anyone while giving me false hopes. Recently in Feb I wanted to end it officially with her because I felt that she wasn’t going to reciprocate my feelings and she made it seem like she really isn’t wasting my time and always told me we would eventually find each other if we are meant to be. ~Plot twist~ 28.03I have been in contact with her TWIN sister (R) for awhile and we met out for lunch too today for her belated birthday celebration. I sense that R has been trying to get my attention and she even went to get the same hair cut as X.... I am not sure if I should continue with X because it’s obvious she’s wasting my time always asking me to wait for her but always giving me false hope and mix feelings.

96440,"Hi everyone, sorry for the rant ahead but I really need some advice and perspective I am currently living with my parents just like many single 20s out there. But my mother is really controlling over every single aspect of my life - from the time I wake up to the time I sleep, from the time I do my school work to what I eat everyday. It’s just this imposing authoritarian presence that I am so stifled in my identity, potential and lifestyle. If I am out and about, when I get home, I have to go through this long questioning about what I eat, what I do ... basically every single detail of my life. And it’s honestly damn tiring. I get that she care about me but there is totally no personal space and boundary to the point that it takes an emotional and mental toll on me. Recently, I watched John’s video on Zula and realised how common this is (from the comment section)https://youtu.be/PtALB_dQGR8Aside from that, my mother has this gender bias whereby the girl (in this case, me) has to do all the saikang/shit job. I have to do all the chores around the house while my elder brother relaxes on the sofa watching tv and playing mobile games. She doesn’t give me a specific list of chores to do. Instead, I am at her every call and demand. So every time she calls me to come and do xyz, I have to go and get it done immediately. When I finally sit down to watch a video or eat, she then ask me to get up to bring her a drink etc. It’s so frustrating - I feel like I am her slave or maid instead of her daughter. I am no financial position to move out on my own or to my relatives (the adults fell out with each other and I am not close to them). I am currently a sad depressed student stuck at home each day, seeing no light at the end of the tunnel. Zoom uni has definitely make things worse as in the past, I managed to get some breathing space in school. Now, I am stuck 24/7/365 in this crazy little space.Any advice?

My friends are already finding place in top firms with high paying while I am still struggling to find a job in normal firms.I know some people may have it worse, but be in my shoes for a moment. I'm in a situation where pretty much everyone (family, friends, etc.) expect me to be very successful in life and excel in work which clearly is not the case.

96420,"[Ask Prof Ben] I graduated from NUS a few years back on a civil service scholarship and am now serving my bond with the govt. As my bond is nearing its end, I am thinking of leaving to do a PhD in the same field as my undergrad studies, which is something I would have done back then if not for the bond. But I'm unsure of making the jump now for the following reasons:1) Age. As someone nearing 30 and probably starting a family soon, I'm not sure if leaving the comfort of a civil service job to be a grad student is a wise choice at this point. 2) I've also left schools for a good 5 years, and my knowledge in the field is very rusty. Not sure if I'm able to still cope with the academic rigours of grad school. 3) Risk. There's the risk of not being able to secure a job after a PhD. There's also the risk that I don't quite enjoy PhD as much as I thought. Would like to hear Prof Ben's thoughts and advice as someone who has gone through a similar path?

Our group contain 3 girls and 1 guy. I have no romantic feeling toward the guy colleague and truly see him as friend. We have known each other for a year and half.

On the dinner day itself , my bf will be very upset whenever he see my social media and keep finding fault with me. He will blame on the clothes I wore (when it’s my usual everyday wear), or upset that I’m sitting opposite / beside the guy, standing next to him or talking to him.. Even if I don’t post on social media, he will be paranoid and start blaming me for cheating on him. if possible, he will not want me to hang out with my colleagues at all just cause the guy colleague will be there and my boyfriend will have this thoughts that I’m cheating on him.. I have no intention to cheat or know  how to handle this situation. Many times I have told him that there’s nothing between me and the guy colleague and that we are just friend but he is not convinced...

I went to ask him about it to communicate and he claims he doesn't like the feeling of people intruding into his private life. But here's the question, am I being sensitive or he's selfish?

I crave the “accidental” touches to my balls and butthole as they work their way up my thighs. When the time is ripe, I would slowly prop my butt up for to allow them access  to the whole glory of my shaft which bring about many gentle yet sensual strokes that get me moaning so loudly that it might penetrate beyond the thin walls of where I was held captive. As the time closes in on the hour mark, I lose my ability to fight the urge and let everything explode through the gates, with some fragments landing on my face before a relaxing wipedown with a warm towel. As I got attached and married to my current partner, I made a vow to stop visiting such places for the sake of her. However, while the fun is over for me, I have picked up some of those sensual techniques to send intense tingling sensations across my partner’s body and have her moaning and begging for penetration.

96390,"This sem's CS3243 continues to be badly taught and administered. To start off with, the lecture was not conducted well, and there were times when the lecturer just read off his slides. In fact, when a student asked him to clarify on a particular slide, he read the slide again and did not answer the question. By looking at the file information of the slides that the lecturer gave us, the author of the file was not even him, but another prof who used to teach the module. The first part of the project for CS3243 talks about an abstract problem that has not appeared much in literature. Suspiciously, a project on the UROPs/FYPs list matched word-for-word with our project statement, and even under the professor himself. Doesn't it seem like he is mining for ideas from the students of CS3243, ultimately presenting the ""best"" algorithm as his own research? There was no consent given by the students, but there is nothing stopping him from passing on the work of students as his own work.Additionally, for the second part of the project, he has repeatedly pushed back the start date of the project such that it is two weeks behind schedule (week 9 to week 10 Friday), which eats into our revision time since there is a Final Quiz for the module in week 13. The prof also unreasonably expects us to use our reading week to work on the project when we have other exams to study for during reading week as well! Does the university not regulate reading week such that students can focus on their exams, instead of having assignments due then?I feel that there are unreasonable demands made in this module that need to be addressed.

In a group im fine with him but when we hang out for a meal just both of us he really drains my energy and i cant stand him, although in the end he is enjoyable to be around. However an issue i have is that he has zero sense of urgency and is always late. I literally never rush him and just let him take his time. The rare occasion that i am late, he will literally spam text me, call me, and jokingly verbally abuse me through text. I dont have mental health issues but i do get very frustrated and irritated because i, who already is always on time, am already uncomfortable myself because i am late. And you, who is ALWAYS LATE, are now popping off because im 5 mins late trying to find a parking lot? So that day i just sent a text, “bro im done” and a voice message to say that im tired of his bs, then i just drove home and muted him.

At first I was like, “Okay, nevermind at least there is a transfer policy between NTU and NUS” so i was okay with it, thinking that perhaps I can excel and make a move to NUS, which is what I am aiming for.Now  I am suffering in my current course which is not working out as intended, now I wake up everyday hating where I am, finding it impossible to spend time on my work because of my mental state. I really want to withdraw but I know it will jeopardise my goal but even then my academic record is not impressive enough for a chance to transfer.

Hence, we are the underpaid and under-recognised profession because that is all we are known for - the people who save doctors that 5 minutes of looking at Lexicomp/UpToDate. Hope those ""thanks for the panadol dose"" words that give you a warm fuzzy feeling, helps to pay for the ever increasing cost of living in Singapore.

It used to be pretty healthy(on the bed) with my exes but for my current bf, I'm having some problem. Both of us have low s*x drive and both are equally clueless. Initially s*x was so painful everytime until I have phobia of doing it. It's not until I talked to my gfs then I know that's because he didn't do any foreplay, just straight plunge. Err...so I tried hinting him abit then we started to have foreplay. But, despite so(me being ready and he being gentle), it's still painful because I think he's slightly bigger than average maybe, and I'm smaller than average maybe(some pain with some exes). Whenever he sees my twisted face, he will ask am I in pain, which I obviously do. But I will say ""abit but okay one lah"" because I want to please him too. But sadly, when I asked him did he enjoy it, he said it's also painful for him... Sigh.....and because of this, we do lesser and lesser until we hardly do anymore. Because honestly, I'm also not very enthusiastic...Both are not lah to be frank. And it got even worse because I think I got even smaller when we don't do much and it became even extra painful each time. It's true v*ginas shrink when not in use for long..I can personally vouch for that..  It's such a regret that we are so loving in many ways but yet don't have a healthy s*x relationship....And I'm very worried he'll find other girls outside where he can ""enjoy"".Sigh....what can I do...is there any way to make myself bigger or not....And is there any way to increase s*x drive for males? Or is it 30+ males naturally have lower drives?-#96338: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96338","['Like: 24 people', 'Sad: 7 people', 'Haha: 3 people']",50 comments,4 shares

96302,"tldr: if parents weren't married, father would most likely be guilty of at least sexual harassment and stalking. what can i do?Hi everyone, my parents are in a very weird dynamic now and would like to ask for help on anything I can do to help? Basically here's the brief run down on what's happening:- there is no love in the marriage, they were basically ""forced"" to marry despite not liking each other (sometimes i wonder how i even exist, i strongly suspect it's a very dark reason (readers fill in the blank yourself))- father suspects mother has affair (which i believe doesn't exist), and so has recently been getting very crazy, reading through every message/phone call in my mother's phone (he managed to guess my mother's password), scrutinizing all of her schedule and work documents secretly. also he's been stalking my mother by going to a food court near my mother's workplace and spying on her, to track her movements and the people she's with (although i think he's stopped now). - father is also a dirty pervert. once caught him masturbating behind my mother while touching her shoulder. also i saw him sniffing mother's panties hanging in the toilet (he doesn't know i saw). mother doesn't know all this other than being touched unwillingly. - father keeps telling me he wants to kill the guy he suspects is chasing mother, also father has said he wants to harm mother's family (they fell out)- mother has been trying to divorce father multiple times, but father keeps refusing.- basically i'm also trying to help mother divorce father because father is just a complete asshole, but looking at sg divorce law, i'm surprised the criteria for divorce is so strict? i don't know which line my parents satisfy, no one has committed adultery, no one has deserted anyone, we are still living together, and no one has been physically violent or anything. at most we satisfy the ""cannot be reasonably expected to live with defendant"" part, but that sounds so vague and open to interpretation, not sure if we satisfy that.- also a bit worried divorce will be rejected because father is quite old now, he has no savings, won't be able to work for much longer, and basically can't live independently cos he doesn't know how to pay his bills and stuff. can the court reject divorce on the grounds of ensuring a vulnerable old person like the father has someone to take care of him? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.-#96302: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96302","['Like: 11 people', 'Wow: 2 people', 'Care: 2 people']",26 comments,1 share
96300,"I've just recently come to the startling realisation that I (22M) still have no idea how to make friends? I don't think it's about being harder to make friends in uni, even in secondary school and JC, I think I never actually progressed with anyone beyond an acquaintanceship. It's like in school, you just talk random crap to the people sitting around you, discuss school work, and at the end of the day, you go home and no one cares about you or texts you except to ask for help on homework. Meanwhile, I see almost everyone else hanging out outside of school, be it to go shopping, watch movie, play sports, etc., but no one has actually asked me to hang out before? So far now I have pinpointed a few possible reasons why no one seems to want to be my friend:1. I have nothing to talk about. I don't follow mainstream media (movies, dramas, music). I don't play the games everyone is playing (e.g. Maple, Dota, LoL). I have no knowledge about any pop culture stuff (e.g. Harry Potter, LoTR, Star Wars, Disney, whatever show is on Netflix, ...). I simply have no interest and do not really like all this stuff. If I force myself to get into these stuff, I feel like I would be just ""mugging"" pop culture and that just sounds totally incredulous to me. I do have hobbies though, I am really passionate about more extreme music like black/death metal, and I learnt to play bass because of this music, but whenever I talk about this people just look at me like some weirdo (especially Christians lol), or just brush me off and never talk about it again. I also like to play computer games, but I usually play games that are 10-20 years old because that's all my computer can run (e.g. I just completed my 5th play through of GTA SA), and also don't really like multiplayer games because they give me more anxiety than fun. On a related note, I don't know how to start a conversation. I googled some conversation starters but almost all of them sound so cringy to me, like I literally don't give a shit what you did during the weekend, or what book you read recently. I feel very uncomfortable asking such textbook conversation openers because then I would be insincere and being fake and I hate being fake. 2. I don't make a lot of eye contact. I heard it's supposed to be a very natural thing, but I am personally super intimidated by it, I will instinctively avoid people's eye contact in less than 1 second, and if I force myself to maintain eye contact, I will literally shudder in anxiety after 2-3 seconds. Am I giving off bad vibes by not making eye contact? Is this how people judge whether you want to be their friend? I really have no idea since I don't look at people's face anyway but that doesn't mean I don't want to be their friend. 3. I am not physically attractive. Sometimes I think that there is something about my appearance (although I don't know what) that puts people off? E.g. there have been multiple times, where I was taking the bus, and the whole bus is packed except for the last empty seat beside me, and yet no one wants to sit beside me to clear up more space? Also when meeting new people in uni, I can literally see the fear on their faces when I am talking to them. Anyways I still have tons of questions about making friends. How does friendship develop? Do people look at somebody, think ""I want to be this person's friend"", and then try some tricks to make that person your friend? Or are friends usually made by people just naturally gravitating together? Is there some secret trick that people do to make friends that I am just wholly unaware about? Must you have common interests with someone to be the person's friend? Anyways, I also want to be able to practice making friends, but I have no idea how to. I am a bit averse to practicing in real-life situations by trying to go out and join communities, because I'm scared half of Singapore will end up knowing me as the creepy awkward guy. In conclusion, I would really appreciate some answers and advice from anyone. I still want to get married and have kids and stuff, but how am I supposed to get a girlfriend if I don't even know how to make a friend? Thanks. (PS I know some of the questions I ask can be easily googled, but I am aware that a lot of stuff on google are written in from a Western/American perspective which may not be transferable to Singapore, so I am hoping to just get some more locally relevant answers.)-#96300: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96300","['Like: 8 people', 'Care: 3 people', 'Sad: 2 people']",8 comments,3 shares

Like any other relationship it has its ups and downs but we get along well together for the most part and we have plans for the future.The problem is she recently brought up an idea of having an open relationship and asked if I was okay with it. Obviously I refused but couldnt help but wonder why even bring this up after being exclusive for more than 2 years. Also, what does this mean when one brings up an idea like that? Is it getting boring for her? Even then there was no indication from her mood or attitude or 'bedroom time' that would suggest anything had changed.

96284,"Dear #96104 &#96224I was in a 10 year relationship with someone whom my parents didnt approve of. I literally grew up with this person on my side all the time but he was just like ur ex - he felt that there was no way he was going to convince my parents. He told me directly, "" if you want to get married to me, find a way to leave your house."" When my parents first found out about us, they went mad. They said no way and that i will suffer if i marry him. But i was adamant. I was determined that this was not going to change my decision and didn't speak to my family members. We constantly fought each time they found out i was out him.In the beginning, i tried to ignore the bigger problem. I told myself that when the time is right everything will fall in place. But it does not.Like your ex, he had issues with his  job, he was not responsible and it was me who started earning a steady income while he was busy job hopping n clubbing. I didnt mind paying for everything because i loved him. But reality hit me. My friends who were together for 2-3 years had plans to BTO, they were planning their lives ahead.  But i was still handling this person and helping him steady his life. He made it look like we weren't planning anything 'cos my parents didnt approve.'Worse, he wouldn't want to talk to my parents or get his parents over to mitigate the issue. I often asked him about just making things formal so that it wouldn't be that awkward for us in future. But he said nope. He said his ego was much bigger and no way he 'was going to step into my parent's home'.Long story short, i decided one day to end the relationship based ENTIRELY on his decision not to come over n speak to my parents. It said a lot about how much he was willing to show he loved me.I was not asking for money or vacations or expensive rings. Just to be on my side to tell my parents together that we got it all settled and to assure them. But he said no.This was not about my parents, but it was about me. About us. It also hit me that he was not confident because my parents were not wrong about his behaviour and irresponsibility. It took me a long time to get over the decade. But trust me, looking back, i am so glad i didnt choose to stay with someone who valued his ego over our relationship.  It hurt like mad, but time definitely heals. PLEASE BELIEVE THAT LIFE MOVES ON.

Make no mistake, I have so much love and respect for this person. I don't know whether to believe what I heard. I wish I can unhear it.

96278,"I am facing something similar to #95814, but 10000x worse.I have a great LT boyfriend who loves me very much and I love him too.But recently, I've felt this attraction/spark with a close friend. The problem is we have been good friends for many years (to the extent that our whole group of friends often visit each other's homes for gatherings, our +1s are aware of all our existence). And in all those years, we've never felt this spark til recently when our conversations started getting deeper.This attraction/spark/passion has really been burning strong... we both feel it... and I'm thinking maybe it's because it's forbidden? But yet it's not just this passion either because there's also the emotional connection, and the depth of conversation is unparalleled. We've been really good friends for years and so we've been quite open and honest about it - but the extent of this feeling is pretty crazy. Like he told me he loves me, and feels guilty about it, since he's married with kids.This whole thing has really been confusing me... and it has been torture because this feeling has been ongoing for a year, on both our ends. To the point where we're both so tired trying to do the right thing, that it became clear that maybe friendship has to be put on hold at least for now, and we've agreed to stop talking and meeting at least for the time being, til we're ready to be friends again, and we've been going out of our ways to avoid each other at social gatherings. It has been awhile and I do feel a lot better now... but it has made me wonder if perhaps there is something wrong with me, or perhaps something is lacking in my current relationship, for me to feel this way, even though I know it's wrong. It has filled me with doubt, and I don't know what I can do to make things right.-#96278: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96278","['Like: 4 people', 'Care: 1 person']",0 Comments,12 comments
96276,"Hi everyone, I need some advice please. The context is that I am an undergrad with a girlfriend who works full time. We have already BTO-ed and plan to get married in 3 years.There’s been much stress in planning a wedding, as we are having an inter race marriage, and as such, have to accomodate to various customs. Regardless, that is something we have to go through anyway, so no complaints. It’s a rite of passage. The problem is that I feel as though I am simply getting too tired, not taking care of myself. I feel that every moment of my life is spent taking care of her and her needs, as she struggles with many problems. I’ve been her rock, and yet I feel like I am cracking. I am constantly listening to the rants and complaints, and it never ends. I find it difficult to deal with the fact that I seem to be an emotional dumpster, struggling with the baggage while people carry on with their lives. However, how can I stop, when I’m the only one she has who understands?This becomes much worse when I am accused of not initiating dates for her to be pampered and such, showing her how much I love her. While there might be some truth in the sense that I haven’t been doing much, I do have a valid reason, that I’ve simply been spending too much. I have explained time and time again that I’m doing my best to save for our future, but it appears to fall on deaf ears. Most of my money is being spent on taking her out to lunch and dinner to places she’s craving for. I am constantly burning through my wallet for her sake. Yet, it never seems to be enough, as there’s always something she feels “I can do better”. The clincher, is that I don’t get treated the way she demands to be treated, which does cause a bitter taste in my mouth. I have attempted to communicate this discrepancy, to disastrous results as she starts to be self-loathing, bemoaning her other responsibilities.I want this to work out for the best, but I think some can relate with the sense of hopelessness I feel now. This passive aggressiveness has led me to feel as though I should just suck it up, even though it’s not right.

And how many times can they go in a day? I've heard friends complain about how it was bad with their ex but good with their current, so what exactly is considered good skills like the comments say????2. On average, how many rounds can a guy go in a day normally? 3. How frequently do people actually have sex??4. Is sexual intimacy / compatibility really that important if everything else is great? Now I'm genuinely worried for when I get married, what if its really bad??? Or what if one wants it more often than the other? 5. Does passion / sexual tension / wtv its called actually last? For people in LT relationships or who are married. Won't it die down or get boring after awhile? 6. People always talk about guys' skills, but I've never heard people talk about girls' skills... so how exactly can a girl be good at sex?? I apologize if I offend anyone, but pleaseee HELP a poor soul out.

96263,"Have y’all heard of a NS love story? And I’m not referring to Pioneer’s family-friendly February cover story. I’m talking about two males finding love in NS, learning what it means to grow together under adversity while navigating the treacherous straits of growing attraction.August 2020, I was posted to my current Battalion. As a “newly-minted” specialist, I was at the impressionable stage – looking for role models and taking my cue from them. Motivationally, I was trying to fit into my unit yet I wanted the dignitas accorded to a leader. It was during this stage that I noticed two powerful personalities whose job scopes involved working extensively with all the stakeholders in my Battalion. This gave me many opportunities to observe their interactions and learn about what others in the Battalion think about them.Chiefly, what drew me was the level of respect that they commanded and I’m not just referring to their section. I’m talking about the regulars, the OCs, the CSMs even the RSM and the CO. When they speak, everyone treats them with a lot of respect, displaying an unprecedented level of appreciation. Never before have I seen NSFs so highly esteemed by regulars and never before have I seen anyone (regulars or NSFs) enjoy such high levels of popularity amongst the NSF population. There was an aura of awe and mystery surrounding this pair and the next 8 months of my NS life was spent unravelling the threads of this story.But before I go further, a bit more about myself. My pro term was spent in Stagmont – Home of Signals and at the end of pro term, I thought that would be the last I would see of Stagmont, at least until ORD. Lo and behold, after donning the chevrons, I was posted to my current unit, literally fed to the wolves (iykyk) and I was dreading the thought of spending the rest of my NS life on repetitive manning. Thankfully, for reasons not relevant to this story, I was not made to live that life. Of relevance is that courtesy of this fact, I got a front-row seat to the exploits of this pair. (and now back to the story)Right from the start, this pair was already a cut above the rest. I learnt that they enlisted into the same BMT company, they went to SCS together, they went through SCS together, they were posted to the same vocation, they were posted to the same unit, they even ORD-ed together. It was as if the Army itself conspired to bring them together. And what’s even more incredible, both of them did exceptionally well in Command School – they finished in the top 1% and top 10% of their cohort. And when I say the Army deliberately brought them together, I say this because it is unheard of for the golden and silver bayo (of the same formation!) to be posted to the same unit, especially since that unit only had 2 openings in the same platoon! (From a policy/planning perspective, it will only make sense to ensure an even distribution of top cadets so that more units can benefit, as opposed to sending the elite few to a single unit.)In hindsight, this decision to send both of them to the same unit paid off though, for reasons which I will now explain.This pair was very effective together. They were clearly subject matter experts and they segregated their roles such that broadly speaking, one of them was more concerned with the policy/planning side of things while the other one of them was more on the ground, involved with the implementation side of things. Using this structure, they set to overhauling the logistics management system for the Battalion, implementing more stringent and robust SOPs to ensure accountability. Spanning over a year, it was their display of professionalism and dedication to their tasks that won over the rest of the Battalion. A refrain commonly heard was, “[A] and [B] have truly done a lot for the Battalion since their arrival” along with “y’all really work very hard for the Battalion”. Perhaps what the regulars really valued was the fact that these two NSFs went over and beyond the call of duty, voluntarily taking on roles and work that would’ve been assigned to regulars and thus lightened the regulars’ workload.But maybe, the reason why this pair was able to do so much was because they loved spending time together. Where others would strengthen their bond going on dates and asking each other out to go on dates, this pair invested their time working closely together on projects, genuinely supporting each other, building something tangible together. Not to mention the close proximity five days a week, eating together, showering together, sleeping together. Taken together, they have fulfilled the three requirements for a relationship to flourish – equality, proximity, and intimacy. Equality, parties respect each other and bring value to the relationship in their unique capacities; proximity, parties spend time together and meaningfully interact with each other; intimacy, parties express their affection for each other.I would want to elaborate more on intimacy. When people think of intimacy, they immediately assume this means physical intimacy and more specifically sexual intercourse. However, intimacy is about expressions of affection. There are many ways to express affection, not just physically. And physical expressions of affection aren’t just limited to sex, take a leaf from this couple’s playbook.Acknowledging the environment that they are in, this pair expresses their affection discreetly and in very thoughtful ways. It comes in simply and constantly – one party waiting for the other to finish his task before taking their meals together. It comes sweetly and discreetly – in the clasping of hands when they think others aren’t watching. It comes fleetingly and attentively – in always looking for each other and smiling when the eyes meet.In such a hostile environment, these two individuals are able to grow and develop together, forming a relationship that is more than the sum of their substantial parts. Secret, commendable and beautiful, their opening chapter might have been written in NS but we’ll await the day they complete this magnum opus.Having been months since they’ve left the Army, I miss them, I really do.-#96263: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96263","['Like: 50 people', 'Care: 13 people', 'Haha: 5 people']",27 comments,16 shares

To my surprise her immediate reaction was “but all my friends in your industry” apparently told her the opposite of what I said.

Personally I find this a very annoying habit. I mean is this even a valid argument to begin with?!Anyway what she said was clearly wrong so I explained to her why and she agreed after hearing my train of thought.

She went on to say that it “reflects badly” on me and that I must “feel the need to put down others to pump myself up”. I was just like huh where is this coming from, why are you insulting me now when I just stated some facts? She then yelled at me saying “you are the one who insulted my friends!!!”What does everyone here think of what happened? I am just shaking my head in disbelief, completely tio stunned.-#96255: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96255","['Like: 15 people', 'Haha: 9 people', 'Sad: 4 people']",59 comments,2 shares
96250,"Am I the ass for being upset at the way my girlfriend handled my birthday?One month before my birthday, I told her it was a big year for me and I am very excited about it. I asked if she is willing to take leave on that day to spend it with me and it will mean a lot to me. She suddenly snapped at me and said I have no right to ask her to do that and got so unproprotionaly angry that I was hurt and confused. Including rollover she has 30 unused leave days this year and has no upcoming travel plans. I got an entire lecture from her on how it is her right on how to use her leave days. I found this whole talk on ""rights"" super turn-off.Two weeks before my birthday she told me she will bake a cake for my birthday. Then three days before my birthday she said she forgot to get the ingredients, can I keep the whole day empty and she tell me on the day itself if she can bake a cake for me? I thought this was somewhat quite selfish of her to expect this because if she cannot then it is too late for me to make alternative plans but I said okay. One day before my birthday she told me she won't be able to bake a cake for my birthday but will make it up to me and bake the cake a week later, instead on my birthday she will come after work and have dinner with me at my place ordering takeaway food. I said okay.She surprised me by coming a few hours later at 11.30pm just before my birthday after I had already gone to bed to surprise me with a slice of cake she dabao earlier in the day, and left an hour later, telling me she will come back to my place for dinner. While it was a nice surprise, it did mess up my sleep cycle as I usually sleep and wake up early. When I woke up though on my birthday, I got a message from her, saying I am free anyway since I took leave on my birthday so I should be the one traveling to her place to celebrate my birthday and not the other way round. She said this despite one month ago I already told her I wish to just stay home on my birthday this year. I told her I wished she could be more reliable especially given the context and she proceeded to spend the next 3 hours on a work day for her, screaming at me, and tearing me to shreds, on my birthday itself. She told me not only is she definitely not coming, she will not be baking a birthday cake for me a week later as ""it does not spark joy for her"".I said you left me hanging, and systematically ruined a super important birthday for me step by step, until the day itself, when it was too late for me to make any alternative plans. She denies all responsibilty and proceeds to gaslight me. Even a week later, she still says it is completely my fault. Her logic and defense now is that she gave me the option to travel to her place at a time of her choosing (she will tell me 30 minutes before she is free so could be anytime between 5pm and 11pm) on my birthday and because I chose not to take this option, it is completely my fault for ruining my own birthday. She said she did her best and hence she is not sorry at all and I have no right to expect her to be sorry. Gosh, another ""rights"" thing going on.To add some detail, she also neither got me a card nor a gift on my birthday. I asked this in passing (it is not the most important thing to me but it would have been nice) and she said what for, not like I got her anything for hers, which is not true at all. I forwarded her back her old message thanking me for the gift and card I got her for her birthday, saying how touched she is. She defended herself by saying oh of course she remembers those things are from me, just that she forgot it is a birthday gift, as she uses them every week.She is so sure that I am in the wrong and not her, that I am left feeling confused, hence I am hoping others here can share their thoughts from an outsider's perspective. For me I am very hurt and upset. Should I be? Or am I over thinking and over sensitive? Can you share how you will feel and how you will handle the situation during and after, if your bf or gf had done the above to you with regards to an important year birthday for you?-#96250: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96250","['Like: 68 people', 'Sad: 57 people', 'Angry: 43 people']",224 comments,30 shares
96243,"Guess I reach a stage in my life where most of my friends are attached or married but I am single. Tried my best to avoid meeting them that often because of the constant persuasion on whether I really wish to settle down or stay single forever. Honestly, I used to focus on career advancement since I do not have much luck in love. The guys are either not ready to settle down, just playing around or making used of me, not sure what they want in love. As i saw many divorce cases in my family tree, it made me so scare that just another person might hurt me again. So I told myself to stop loving anyone for 5years &more. Recently, I have thoughts of settling down. Looking around me, most of my friends are girls and even my guy friends are majority married or attached. I do not believe in dating applications because most of them are just after good looking girls whereas I am just a average looking girl. I do not wish to disappoint my grandma as she told me she wish to see me married before she passed away. I really do not know what to do and need some suggestions. I am open to hear, thank you.-#96243: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96243","['Like: 22 people', 'Care: 8 people', 'Sad: 4 people']",19 comments,3 shares
96242,"With all the hate on small dicks these days, and that most men probably suffer from insecurities with their size, I would like to chime in as an ex sex addict/veteran who probably had over 50 sex partners ranging from hookers, escorts, fwbs and ex-gfs, and got by with an average or below average penis judging from how sizes get way inflated online. 1) It is probably common knowledge that vaginas come in different sizes, but tightness is a skill that can be trained. The best sex I had was with a caucasian escort who was really skilled at gripping my penis and making me climax real quickly. On the contrary, the worst sex I had was on a drunk hookup where the girl basically just spread her legs and expected all the work from me. It was a frustrating session that I couldn’t even cum after 2 hours. So ladies, please get good at tightening your vaginas and stop complaining about your man’s size.2) Well dude, if the lady you are having sex with doesn’t want to work on that and you desire tightness, I realized from experience that women who are chubbier tend to have them a lot more snug and warmer by default. 3) Explore sex positions that allow for deeper penetration and experiment with how certain hip placement makes her feel tighter. I wouldn’t go into detail about this as there should be ample resources online on this topic.4) Stop watching so much porn (Applies to both men and women). This creates unrealistic expectations of manhood size for women, and also creates problems such as erectile dysfunction for men. Yup, what’s the use of a big penis or a grower if it never gets rock hard? The ability to open many tabs and search for different kinks with a few clicks would desensitize you from real sex. Real sex is sweaty, and can smell funky from all the vaginal fluids too.-#96242: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96242","['Like: 72 people', 'Haha: 35 people']",30 comments,19 shares
96227,"Hi , I'm 20 and consider myself straight. But I met this gay guy at school (age 21) and we really got on. We made fast buddies and I admit I did strangely find him attractive. He's taller than me, lean, thick dark hair, and super- blue eyes. The first hint that something was up was when we were in the shower cubicle at the campus gym and I saw him naked. It totally turned me on. Fortunately, I had my pants on because there was definitely an erection. So some time goes by and we hang out (and yeah, in between I did jerk off imagining him). Then one night about a few months ago I was over at his house and we were watching a movie. We were sitting pretty close together and I felt inclined to hold his hand so I reached over and took it. He didn't even seem surprised, though I did notice a smirk on his face. Anyway, he didn't pull away and we just sat there holding hands for awhile. Then we sort of glanced at each other, and he leaned forward and kissed me. Then I kissed him back and we made out on his couch (at some point we were even lying down, him on top of me, and that got me even more turned on). He led me by the hand to his bedroom, we took each other's clothes off, and had sex (everything short of anal since I was not prepared for that in more ways than one). And I was confused but pretty happy, and it was honestly better than any sex I've ever had with a girl (though my experience in that arena is rather limited). I ended up spending the night with him. From that point on, our interactions changed. When greeting each other, we kiss, I spend a few nights a week at his place.My roommate (who is also gay) walked in to our apartment once and found me with my head in his lap and him stroking my hair. Afterwards, my roommate referred to him as my boyfriend, and I had to correct him, because again, I'm straight, but I feel strongly connected with him and enjoy spending time close to him. But then last night my sister asked how things were going with my boyfriend. She said it jokingly, but it's starting to make me self- conscious. Am I misinterpreting this relationship, and we're more than just close buddies who periodically have fun? Is it possible I'm not straight, or do no other straight guys feel comfortable doing stuff like this? Any advice?-#96227: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96227","['Like: 87 people', 'Haha: 80 people', 'Wow: 12 people']",131 comments,76 shares
96226,"I am the one who write on confession #96104. First of all, i sincerely apologise for all the paragraph and English that is not type properly. Also all the headache and eating of panadol to some people that I have cause. Let me change on the phasing and English.I was in a 6 years relationship. Due to my family objection on our relationship, we have to break up. I have been arguing with my family because of this relationship. Despite how much I try to convince my family, this relationship is worth, they will still comment "" if you think is worth than go ahead but end of the day even if I marry will end up divorce"". Additionally, for the pass few month, after I choose to proceed with the relationship and tell my family on my plan to have house and marry, they will either ignore my words or find way to stop me or give me very stastic answer. The main reason why my family feel that this bf is not worth together, they feel that he do not have proper job. starting when he work freelance, they feel he had no stable cpf. After I try to convince him to work full time job, my family got no objection. moving forward, after he work for 1 years plus, he feel stress and resign without finding job. when my family know about this, they don't like and start with their objection on this relationship again. Despite all this,  I try to hold on to this long 6 years relationship, I try to talk to my bf to solve on the issue we have. Told him why future is important, he mentioned he just want to work no stress work and he feel that his parent can go through this last time so he can do the same too. Whatever he say I could endure and willing to find way to overcome to maintain this 6 years rs. But recently when I ask him to try to convince my parent to accept him, he told me if I cannot convince, he convince also no use. why need to be so unhappy as family is important. Long story short,  me and the bf officially broke up recently as he not willing to convince my family despite how much I could accept that he want to work no stress job and have no much plan for future. I feel quite emotional of this rs since we have been together for sometime. I just hope to get some advice to hold on to fight for this rs or move on to another person. Seeking advice. # Lastly, I saw some of the previous comment on bread is important and ask me to move on. Thankful for those that actually comment and give me advice despite my earlier post with a lot of paragraph and language issue.

96222,"Is catfishing supposed to be super common on dating apps? I've started using dating apps recently, but I must say that the few people I've met look really different from their pics, not in the nice way. Personally, I know where I stand and I'm not very choosy myself, and I would have still went out with them to get to know each other better if they used an accurate pic. However, if the norm is to catfish and expect catfishing, I can't help but feel like I'm underselling myself and getting screened out by others because I look the same in person.-#96222: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96222","['Like: 7 people', 'Haha: 2 people', 'Sad: 1 person']",0 Comments,12 comments

Assume she has heard all the usual views and arguments in favour but have decided it is not something she wants to entertain.

96214,"My ex gf falsely accused me of domestic violence which resulted in an arrest record for me. Fortunately, the courts did not find me guilty and I was able to reclaim my innocence. Unfortunately this still means I have a police record, an arrest record, which is not great in certain scenarios like in some background checks.Official stuff otherwise, on a more personal level, I really will not know how to explain this to a future serious gf or fiance or wife. At the very least, I will expect this to affect our relationship negatively. As I have kept this an absolute secret, I am also super afraid of this news leaking out to others.This has been a heavy load on my mind for over five years with no avenue to turn to hence am now writing on this anonymous forum.

96204,"i’m a 24M student, single for life. seeing friends BTO or getting attached, discussing their future or even setting up a family. i’m quite stressed out on how should i plan out my future, such as when to settle down and get a gf etc. I talked to my friends and most of em have different circumstances and doesn’t seem to apply to me. i’ve always been a goal driven person, planning out my financials and even hobby, filling my days with activities such as studying or hitting the gym, reading books or just doing some side job buy and sell etc. i’m not born with a golden spoon, i have to plan my own expenses (student loan and daily expenses etc  )and get my own money, such as doing part time job etc. basically, self sufficient. so here’s the main point , how do people my age actually manage to get themselves a partner while being able to study and spend so much money (dating etc)? if i were to do the same i would be spending my time working part time, spending my night studying and working myself off. i’ve been thinking if getting a partner would actually be a financial burden to myself, to the extent of affecting my studies.Note: yes, it seems like i’m unable to get out of my comfort zone, i just wanna see how people think and what’s their approach in life in order to get some motivation.should i be actively seeking for a partner now? or just chill out until i graduate?

96192,"My boyfriend and I have a huge difference in sleeping patterns and ever since I started working full time, I feel like it’s beginning to take a toll on our relationship. He has the habit of sleeping at wee hours in the morning (5-6am) whereas I am usually asleep by 12am. This means that he only wakes up around 2-3pm (even on days we plan to meet) and by that time, half the day is over for me, since I have to get up early the next day for work. Our weekly dates have since become super routine, in a sense that we only spend about 2 hours just hanging out before having dinner and then going home. It makes me feel as if I am the one causing our dates to be like this since I have to be home early. I have spoken to him about the issue but he feels that it is not a problem and he always promises to fix his sleep schedule but never does it. There was once we made plans to meet at 11am and  he only woke up at 2pm. I was pretty angry because I made the effort to be there on time only to feel like I was being stood up. And when he finally woke up, he didn’t understand why I was so angry as it was just a small matter to him. Sometimes I even think back and wonder why I was so dumb to actually continue waiting there for 3 hours - until he called back. I have no idea if such a difference is a red flag? Or a sign that maybe we are really not that compatible.. or I am just not important enough for him to compromise-#96192: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96192","['Like: 33 people', 'Sad: 9 people', 'Haha: 3 people']",31 comments,11 shares
