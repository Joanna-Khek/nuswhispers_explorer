#102709,2021-03-29,"How to get over the guilt and unhappiness from my job?I've never believed in corporate and don't want to work all my life climbing a ladder where I'm just an employee / pawn to another person's company, so my boyfriend and I spend whatever free time we have left building our own side projects, which already make double my personal income (which is currently low six figures), in a span of only 6 months since we have started seriously working on it. Besides, my day job is paying me a fixed income which doesn't scale based on the effort I put into it. Although it's very chill (it's a management role - I work at my own pace), I'm slowly but surely losing interest in it. I only spend around 50% of the actual work day actually doing work and spend the rest of my time working on side stuff. I don't find it worth it at all to spend more time on it when the amount of time spent on our side work has made so much more. However, by nature I've always been a by-the-book person and I feel deeply uncomfortable for ""cheating"" and ""lying"" to my company which is paying me for 100% of my time, when I'm barely putting in much. I constantly feel unhappy even though I tell myself stuff like make a to-do list, complete it, and go about the rest of my day doing whatever I want. I simply can't get over the emotions I feel no matter how much logic I try to apply to this to convince myself. The nature of my role is also not fit to my personality. I'm introverted and shy by nature but am forced to constantly interact with strangers and push them to do things. The interactions I have with others haunt me even after work and that is weird but true.  It's making me so unhappy that in the mornings I don't feel like waking up and I spend a huge part of my day feeling uncomfortable. Every single day, I dread going to work and I wished I could spend all my time just doing things I believe in and enjoy doing. After work, my mind is occupied with thoughts of the way I'm not giving the company 100%. Yet, I also struggle with the conflicting thoughts that I am wasting my time on my day job which doesn't give any good ROI. I've thought about leaving my job to focus fully on our side project, but for the time and effort I'm spending on it, it's actually more worth it to stay in this job. Besides that, my boss had recently nominated me for promotion and my bonus will be great. My boyfriend believes I should stay for the bonus or for stocks vesting, which will take place in the next few months. As my company has a good brand name, it might be a good idea to stay also for credibility. Moreover, I'm unsure of many things when I quit - will I suffer because I have no cpf? My resume will have a gap? I don't have sufficient official work experience in my field which is currently lucrative, and if our project ""fails"", I may have no options. I also don't want to overly rely on my bf. What should I do?-#102709: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102709",20 ,3 ,0,0,0,16,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#102705,2021-02-28,"How can we play our part in accelerating a recession?Property prices are simply too ridiculous now. HDB resales literally jumped 12.7% in the last year. Im sure wages didn't increase this much. Any cooling measures will be likely designed to stagnate, not drop, the prices. After all, last guidance from MAS is that property market is not yet overheated. The younger folks, who are most impacted by ridiculous property prices, also have generally better job security. Apart from a recession, I don't really see anything else that will make housing more afforable for younger folks.-#102705: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102705",12 ,1 ,0,0,8,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#102704,2021-02-28,"Hi everyone, so currently I'm in a relationship with this girl but she has this so called ""princess syndrome""She'll always ask me buy stuffs from online shopping, saying she'll paynow me back but she didn't. Is not a one or two times incident. Been like minimum Twenty times.When we go out for dates, she watch those videos about couple doing things that make them looked cute.She'll ask me to do things that she felt is cute/romantic and asked me to do the same. For examples, piggyback her in the middle of shopping mall. Give her surprise gifts like I'm some kind of magician. Worse of all, her temper is really very bad. There was once before the CB period, bbt was not allowed to operate as they're not considered essential. She messaged me. Asked me to go and buy for her, which I did. As you all know the Queue was extremely long and the drinks availablity probably ran out. I took photo of the crowds and said ""I might not be able to get the drink you want"", she replied "" yeah can, just buy what's available""During mine turn to order, the drink she always ordered was oolong milk tea with pearl but it ran out. Only left milk tea with grass jelly so I took it. Took quite awhile for the order to be completed n I took transportation to her house. Probably about 1.5 hrs for buying the bbt and travel to her house.i was excited to show her that I've managed to get bbt for her and thought she'll be happy but her next actions totally stun me.She looked at the drink n was screaming "" what drink is this? You know I only drink oolong milk tea with pearl"" I explained that I alr told her that I might not be able to get the drink she wanted and she was the one that said she was fine with it. But now she's screaming at me. She opened the lid and splashed it on me then slammed the door. During the incident, her parents was not in the country so only she was around in the house. I tried to knock on the door for like half an hour but she didn't even opened the door. I tried to call her but she rejected the calls and processed to block me. I have no choice so I went back home with the splashed bbt shirt.When I reached home, she texted me. Saying how disappointed that she is for having high expectations that I should've know her by now what's her favourite drink, how I didn't persistent to knock on her door to show mine efforts of trying to explain to her and how I should've reflected on myself for being a disgraceful boyfriend.During the days where she ignored me. I have this relaxed, calm environment and feelings which I didn't have it for quite awhile since I dating her. I googled and all the search results shown was that it due to being away from a toxic relationship.I was so disappointed by her actions, no matter how much efforts I've put in. It was never good enough to please her. After the incident, few days later. Her parents texted me. They apologized for their daughter actions. They said that the neighbors witnessed the incident n told them about it. I said is okay, I'm cool with it and they've gave the parents talk to her. Following day after her parents texts, she texted me and apologize for her actions in the incident and I accepted it. But ever since we get back together, it just seem to be back to the days where she'll  be screaming at me for not getting what she wants or not her expectations.I'm feeling exhausted from this relationship and I wanna to talk to her about her behaviour, the status of our relationship. But she just always avoiding it I need some advices on how do I talks to her in a way that she'll be listening to me and not always screaming at me like it was everything my fault for all that happened in the relationship.-#102704: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102704",167 ,36 ,0,31,34,38,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#102703,2021-02-28,"Hi, this is my 3rd time posting bcoz my previous posts didn't get approved.  I've been in a cold war with my husband for the past 1 mth due to an incident that caused us both to get pissed off. Here's how it goes, my bff and her family caught covid and I wanted to send a care package over. I told my husband that I want to go buy some things for her and asked him to send me to her place. He brushed me off and said asked me to wait cos he was busy. So days past and I was thinking it's gonna be too late if I wait until he's free. So I decided to go myself. After sending our kid to school one morning, I asked him to send me to ntuc to buy some things and he wasn't too happy also. Then I said I'm going to buy things and pass to my bff and he blew his top at me. He started saying things like don't you think of your family? Like you still have a child and elderly mum etc. Then I replied I'm only leaving the things there outside the door and leaving. It's not like I'm going into her house? Right? Wtf? Anyway, he wasn't happy still and he basically drove recklessly from our kids school to the mall where he dropped me off and the moment I got off he zoomed away. Wth? Idk what's his problem but I'm really speechless by the way he treated me like I'm some dumb blonde. He self assumed what he thought I was going to do. And behaved recklessly through his driving. After I got home, we didn't talk until now. I'm frustrated that he never ever apologies for his mistakes. And I always have to be the one giving in to him. When I'm wrong I buck up my courage to apologize but a simple misunderstanding like this he's unwilling to do so. I'm so tired of his behavior and divorce came up to my mind. But I've been a SAHM for years and I don't have an income. I don't want to be the one always giving in to him. It's so tiring and I hate it. Can someone please enlighten me?-#102703: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102703",32 ,3 ,0,4,4,6,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
#102702,2021-02-28,"#102684, I am a girl who was in a similar situation as you. But I'm the rider.You didn't say how your guy friend got into motorcycles, but the fact that it's not about his salary already says a lot. Sometimes it's not just about the hobby itself but the reasons behind it. I can speak for a number of riders who consider it their most treasured expression of freedom. Something that other people might find difficult to respect, much less understand.The guy I thought I loved most in the world, my best friend, turned out to be no different from my controlling parents the moment I told him about my interest in bikes. Even after I passed my 2B and purchased my bike, my first vehicle, he had nothing to say but nasty comments and kept telling me to sell it. He even said he wished I had failed my 2A. Can you imagine telling someone you love such toxic remarks? If not now, at this rate you might just find yourself doing that. What good would even come out of it?So yeah, if you ""don't know why he insists he needs to ride"", you should at least get it into your head that your relationship doesn't have the right to edge out everything you don't like about his lifestyle. Literally, if you can't provide more happiness/mental well-being than riding, do both yourself and him a favour and find some other guy lol-#102702: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102702",0 ,6 ,0,1,0,12,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

This branch is the worst. Turnover rate is the highest. The manager is non existent. The other staff go for smoke breaks that lasts hours then I'm forced to do the job of 5 people because I don't smoke. Maybe I should pick up 'smoking' too just so I can also MIA like them.

#102689,2021-02-28,"How should I deal with my SO’s family?Throughout the years that we have been together, they have badmouthed me behind my back and also openly accused me of being a bad influence on my SO many times, even after knowing that we will be getting married.Almost every single time when they are unhappy with my SO, they blame it on me, even when I am not involved at all. Most recently, it escalated to them punching my SO in the arm and prodding my arm and threatening to beat their child’s face, while verbally abusing us (e.g. stupid, useless). They also said that it is their right to hit their child when it is legally not true for ages >21.My SO is much older than me and has their own way of thinking but the family seem to think otherwise. Another member of their family refused to take our side and just ask us to apologise and suck it up, get it over and done with even when they know that it is not our fault. I believe that just by being elders do not give the right to be unreasonable and not even try to change their bad behaviour.

#102688,2021-02-28,"Follow up on - https://www.NUSWhispers.com/#!tag/102288My friend found a job. TBH, he received six offers within a week(One of them is a top tech company, but he declined the offer. ). He accepted one of the other offers last week. Unlike my previous post, this post is a reminiscence about his interviews. This may be useful for some people.1. There will be people in the interview panel who will speak rudely and make you uncomfortable and demotivated. There was somebody in his interview panel who asked that ""You do not know how to code"". With more than 6 years of experience, he is one of the better programmers in our cohort.  I am not saying that he cannot do any mistakes. Even if there are mistakes, there should be a way to tell. It is the interviewer who should be ashamed of themself, not you. 2. Companies would give you a take-home assignment for 2 days. In the end, they would expect a full-fledged working system. In most cases, it is not possible to capture all aspects. As long as you write something with a good design idea and cover most test cases would be sufficient. Still, there would be people complaining about your code. Just pass them, there would be people who take you.3. Recruiters try their maximum to buy you by giving a small salary increase. Learn to say ""No"". join a company that you like and you feel comfortable with your skillset. My friend has the problem of saying ""No"". In the end, it is you who are going to work. Don't be prey for recruiters.4. There would be interviewers who will reject regardless of how you perform. Do not get disheartened. This happens here and there, not frequently. 5. Do not lowball yourself. My friend is getting a hike of 40%. The market is quite good.  Learn how you can demand salaries. 6. Do LeetCode.-#102688: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102688",5 ,7 ,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He is a loving person that really cares for me. But one thing that I really disapprove of is his motorcycles. He is a fan of them and can talk about them for hours. I am very afraid of him getting into an accident. He told me he will be careful and everytime I mention that I don't like it that he rides, he turns cold and doesn't respond much. I don't know why he insists he needs to ride. His salary is more than enough to afford a car and I think all of his friends also drive. I can't understand why he needs to put his life at risk every day. I am so worried that I doubt whether the relationship is worth me being worried all the time. I know that if he chooses not to ride, he will be very unhappy. Although I think he would do it for me. I am so conflicted. Any other girls in the same situation?

Many years ago when I was young (can’t remember exactly how young I was but I am very sure I wasn’t even 9 yet), she actually taught me how to kiss.. not just kiss but French kiss. It didn’t happen once or twice but many occasion. Back then, I was young and I did not think of telling my parents. And also, s**  education weren’t something that my parents would teach us.

I feel dirty. I cry at the thought of what happened more than a decade ago. Recently, she quarrelled with me over some issues and I really couldn’t contain the secret I’ve hidden in me and I blurt out and said about what happen many years ago. She actually denied doing it to me and told me to stop saying things that she didn’t do. Afterwards, she block me on WhatsApp and even social media and removed me from the Netflix account that she gave me. Infront of people, I am always seen to be bubbly and cheerful. No one will ever know what I go through and it’s really been tough for me. I don’t even have a proper closure to this that happened to me. And I really feel so hurt.

#102667,2022-03-26,"My older sister is a very materialistic person. My parents have spoilt her rotten. I am not jealous of her. My parents probably realized it's too late to discipline her so they choose to be more strict with me when I was young.Since my sister is older than me she has more privileges than me which I guess is normal. Once my parents wanted to stop her from going out so they bribed her with $100 to stay home. She stayed home and kept the $100. My parents have the tendency to use money to control her which I find is rather demeaning.This won't work on me. I would prefer to go out and skip the $100. My parents know they can't bribe me with money. My sister stopped her education at O levels, worked a while, then went private and tried to get a degree, failed again so she gave up and went back to work again and yet is still taking an allowance from my parents. She buys Chanel, Cartier, Prada and other branded stuff and uses high end products all over herself. I know with her salary, it's impossible to afford her current lifestyle. So I suspect she has other money sources, not just from my parents. Draw 2,3k< a month how to afford a few Hermes?I'm the opposite of her. I'm thrifty and I use and wear budget or normal brands that people my age can afford.I can accept our differences and she is nice to me. What I cannot accept is her loose morals. While we were still studying I introduced her to join my group of friends. I have some guy friends a bit older than us. This was pre covid.

My guy friend later told me that my sister grabbed and kissed him earlier and he was shocked and offended. He avoided my sister after that. It was not the first time my sister tried to throw herself at my guy friends. I talked to my sister about it and she said she didn't care if they have someone else, in fact she liked the challenge. I thought she was crazy.Another time I attended a xmas home party with my friends and I took my sister along because she wanted to come. There were several expats in the group because I just did an event with some of them. After the party I realised my sister had exchanged phone numbers with 2 of the expats and was trying to date them for lunch or something. The thing is those guys are not single. My sister told me her dream is to marry a non local, at least 10 years older than her. And this is the most important. Must be very very wealthy. She dreams of getting married dressed in Chanel and all the most expensive branded accessories and wearing a diamond larger than the width of her ring finger. I don't know if she have enough traits and talents to get such a guy. She told me she have Ons when she was seeing a guy who was regularly giving her money. She didn't love the guy, he was not rich enough, not old enough and a local but since he was giving her money she didn't mind. I really don't know why she want to live like this. I suspect maybe she had other sugar daddies all this while. She dumped the guy when she decided to target her new boss. She told me her boss is her perfect dream man. He's older, non local and wealthy. The problem is he's married. By the time she told me about it, she was already seeing him. She kept saying his marriage is stale already so it will be ending soon. I discouraged her and asked her to look elsewhere or wait for him to be divorced first. Of course she didn't listen to me. The horrible part is I told my parents about it and they supported her to try and get married to this guy! She did get together with the guy and he got divorced and married my sister after that. My sister got her dream diamond ring and dream wedding. My sister told me she never want to have children because she didn't want to go out of shape and she love herself too much to sacrifice for another human being. I don't understand. Both of us came from the same parents, both of us lived through the same environment. Why did she become like this?  I gave her my blessing but seeing how she turned out made me fearful of settling down with anyone. What if there is a woman out there, like my sister, waiting to take away my relationship or marriage?I fell out with my sister recently over some family issues. I find she is too selfish and thinks only for herself. Up till this day, she has never given my parents anything. Only take and take and take. Now she has married she never once offered to see if my parents need help with anything too. I'm still staying with my parents so I've been helping out with everything at home after I have started to work. I just find this whole situation ridiculous.-#102667: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102667",20 ,8 ,0,7,0,21,0,0,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

They are aware of your views about certain things. They are usually smarter, cleverer and more intellectually inclined than you, and they make use of this trait and make fun of you with words and comments that just throw you off course. Seeing you react in a flustered and agitated way is entertainment for them. When confronted, they would give a 'Why so serious?' attitude and reply. Seems to them that if you don't take the bait, then you will not be affected by what they said. If you can be more tolerant and take things easy, you will not see their comments as blades and swords, but instead, you will treat them as jokes and laugh it off. It is very hard to be friends with these people. You will never know when they are joking with you. You will never be sure when they are making fun of you. You will certainly never know when you will be their target for entertainment. Ultimately, you will still be a clown and joke to them, easily manipulated and controlled.

#102660,2022-03-26,"I have a friend who always tells me I could have done better in everything with my life. From shopping to meals, she would tell me I could have picked something else etc.If I'm seeing a new guy she would always tell me I could have done better. It's like all my choices are inferior according to her. When I was getting married she maintained her stand I should have picked a richer/taller/better looking guy. She didn't approve of my choice  but she did ask me if my husband knows anyone who has similar views like him to introduce to her. So it means she didn't find my husband that bad right?If I mention about my married life she would call me useless for being too lenient with my husband. She always have a cynical view about everything and everyone. I notice everytime after meeting with her, I would come home and be negatively affected towards my husband. I start to notice she's not a good friend for my marriage. I slowly start to spend less time with her. She knew this guy and married him after 6 months of knowing him and tried to ruled him with an iron fist. She told me all the things which she did to dominate him and she was very proud of herself. I felt she sounded abusive and a little abnormal to me. Her marriage didn't last a year. The guy left the country to be with another woman.I don't know why I am able to ignore her views for years. Just because I told her a part of what happened to me, she would use it to make a harsh judgment of my entire marriage/life using that 1 point I mentioned. I start to share less and she would use the same old pointers to say me. It's like she got no inkling that people can grow and some things are not constant in relationships.I felt over the years, she has never grown as a person. Her marriage was a good example to me she has some internal issues that she refuses to acknowledge. She is very proud to check her partner's phone regularly and forbid him to talk to female friends. I couldn't get a direct reply from her when I ask why she does that so I decided to leave it be. She said I should check my husband too and keep saying I will regret it one day.  I come from a family where I have a very domineering parent so I have a softer personality. I felt my friend has a very domineering personality too. Maybe that's why I'm drawn to be friends with her. She told me I'm her best friend and only friend who can stand her. I dislike it when I share something vulnerable with her and she would use it as a weapon to insult me later. I didn't tell her everything about me and she always assume she's my only friend too. I have more married friends, friends who have children, compared to single friends as I've got older. So far I find she is the most draining friend to be around so I start to spend less time with her. The last straw was after I had my first child. I went out with her to have a meal without my child. We were queuing and before us was a family with a young toddler. The toddler was swinging and twirling her ballerina skirt while waiting to enter the restaurant. I gave the toddler space to play while my friend saw the child and didn't budge in the queue. So naturally the child eventually swung into my friend and stepped onto my friend's shoes.  The toddler didn't say anything and carried on swinging. The parents weren't looking so they didn't notice their child had knocked into my friend. My friend started to fume, she huffed loudly and said loudly, ""Some people shouldn't breed!...."" blah blah blah, something along those lines. She made eye contact with the child, glared, and told the child to f*** off. The child cried. The parents picked up the child, ignored my friend's insults and avoided eye contact with us. My friend didn't stop speaking loudly and badly about them and their child. I had it. I left the queue and walked away. She followed me and demanded that she didn't do anything wrong. She felt the child should have been controlled by the parents. I told her she had been young once. She was not injured. Her feet is still intact. Why the cruel reaction? I told her I wouldn't want to let my child be near her.Sensing I have insulted her, she started to cry and said she hated all children, including mine. I lost my appetite and ended the meeting with her. She said see you again and I think she don't mean it. I think this is the last time I'll be meeting her. A while later she texted me like nothing happened. I don't think can get over how she behaved. My husband said its a waste to lose this friendship, I could be her only lifeline because people like her usually don't have much friends and I should try and forgive her if I cherish her friendship. My husband says she is a very hurt person. Because no normal person would be so hateful about everything in life. I disagree. I told my husband not to mention this person to me again. Am I being cruel?-#102660: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102660",43 ,9 ,0,10,0,32,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

We were outside with a group of friends so this relative straight up asked my bf who is this girl (me), asked to intro me to him. That's when my bf told him I'm the gf. This relative actually has a wife.I got married to my bf a few years later. Everytime when I visit my in laws, if he's around he would try and come over or greet us when we arrive or leave. The way he looks at me. It makes me extremely uncomfortable. He is staring at me as though I'm naked. I've told my husband about this a few times. He told me to just stay away from him or not talk much to him and he should get the message. A few times when there are gatherings (pre covid), he would openly leer at me while his wife purposely ignore his act. It made me so self conscious to the point I will intentionally wear more conservatively when I know he will be around. A few times I almost wanted to say it out to embarrass him into stopping but I don't have the courage to do that. I also make sure I am never alone with him because he gives me the creeps.Then covid came, I was glad that I don't have to see him as much. But now can meet 10 pax soon, my in laws are arranging to have a meal together (us and them since they live next door). I'm so not looking forward to this. Should I just tell his wife that her husband glaring at me is really annoying the f out of me? I've come across some men who are uncultured and would stare at women like that.

Overall we are happily married, both of us have ok career and my husband has been taking good care of me.Around my late puberty years, when I was 14-15 years old, I was curious about myself, and also a bit naughty, so I took some inappropriate selfies. I never shared them with anyone, just kept them in an old thumb drive, together with other old photos. Overtime, I forgot about their existences.Last week, I caught my husband pleasuring himself (he often does it when I don't have the mood for s**), and shockingly, using those photos of mine as materials. Apparently, he found those photos when cleaning up old thumb drives. I was furious, not just because of shame, but also because those are underage materials.My husband's defending arguments were that: 1. He didn't cheat on me or fantasized about other girls, because those are photos of me. 2. The girl in the photo, at this very moment, is of legal age, and is his legal wife, so the thing he did was not morally wrong.Though my husband has been trying to make-up with me, we still haven't talked again since then. I still feel uncomfortable whenever I think about it. What should I do? Should I just delete those pictures and try to forget about this event?

#102644,2022-03-25,"I have a turbulent with my mother since I was young. She is a very abusive woman. I suspect she has some form of disorder that is undiagnosed for decades. Or she just hated me.I do not know my relationship with my mother is not normal until I've witnessed how my female friends talk to their mothers. My friends can talk to their mothers like a friend and have a calm and normal conversation. While my mother acts like a dictator and if I'm not saying yes to her, she would tell me to shut up. She frequently gets angry and would shout at me. If my brother upsets her, she would take it out on me. If she is in a bad mood, she would throw things to hit me when I walk past. It's like my existence is a nuisance to her. I did not know it's not normal for me to cry every week. She would often call me a good for nothing if I did something not up to her standard. If I try and clean the floor, she would scold me for doing a lousy job. Or she would snatch the broom mid way and bang sweep the entire house. She would use the broom and run over me whenever she got the chance. She would run other things over me on purpose too. If she walk past me she would bang me out of her path. It's like she is expressing her anger and contempt towards me. I've learnt to dodge but sometimes I still get hit by her. I didn't know this is not normal till I'm older. The sound of the broom banging everywhere still triggers me. Imagine it's been 20 years and if I accidentally bang the broom along my wall in my own home, I am reminded of my mother's anger towards me. If I hear dishes clanging or what not similar, I would be reminded of my mother's anger.When I'm a teenager she would often call me a prostitute and threaten to shave off my hair. This of course angers me and has deeply affected me. I suspect she was jealous of my youth. I didn't have a bf till I'm 20. I work during school breaks and save up for school expenses. I don't party or drink. I meet my friends and go to the mall like other kids and I go home for dinner. I've never spent a night out before. I don't think I'm a bad kid. My grades are better than my brother and I'm in a better school and I did not stay back academically and yet she still talks to me like I'm stupid.  She would tell me she's prettier than me and make hurtful comments about my looks. I got lean genes from my dad who passed away when I was young while my mom is a typical pear shape so I look less like her.Things got worse when I started working. My brother was married by then. She didn't want to take money from my brother because she didn't want to 'bother' him. But she wanted me to give her a huge cut of my salary and she wanted to quit her job and stay home. She was bragging and lying to others that I gave her all my monthly salary. I took over house expenses but she wanted me to give her more each time. Our home was newly renovated for about 5 years and she wanted me to change all the furniture. I refused. She wants me to change TV when the old one is fine. She would make a down-payment for something, not tell me after she's done and expect me to pay the rest. She didn't work for a year and managed to shift everything in the house several times within that duration. She would ransack my room, shift everything and throw what she deems fit. I often come back from work to a newly rearranged room with many things missing and she will say she don't remember where she put what if I ask. She would barge into my room when I'm changing. If I lock it she would bang the door till I open it. I have resorted to locking the door when I sleep else she would just come in and remove cash from my wallet without telling me. A few times I went out to buy food, only to realize I can't pay because she had taken all my cash. I did give her an allowance and I was paying all the bills. I used to let her claim grocery from me but I notice she spends a few hundred weekly when it was just the 2 of us at home and I seldom eat at home because she 'always ate already' no matter what time I come back. If I ask her if she wants dinner she will tell me she ate 2 hours ago. She cannot give me a direct answer and she doesn't eat at normal meal times. I just give up and take care of my meals before I go home or I would just get whatever I need and cook for 2. It's impossible to have a normal conversation with her. She would leave empty food boxes or packages in the fridge or countertop and when I want to consume it I will realise its empty and I would have to bin it. Imagine my frequent disappointment of seeing only 1 piece of potato chip in a stack chips container with the seal not fully removed and capped back to look like it's 'new'.She would cook vegetables till they turn yellow and say only buy the vegetables with holes because there is no 'pesticides' on it. My diet is mainly raw now, vegetables like salads and what not due to her constant serving over cooked food over the years. She kept buying new kitchenware, clothes, everything you can think of, and throwing out stuff that are still usable. So I stopped giving her extra money. I don't have an endless flow of cash for her spendthrift habits. One of the worst things that I find it impossible to forget that she did was when I gave ah ma (her mom) ang bao during cny, my mother snatched the ang bao, opened it in front of us, said I gave ah ma too much, she pocketed pieces of notes and gave my ah ma the reminder. And she refused to return me the amount, saying I have already given it out. She would scream at ah ma, verbally abuse her or roughly handle her when visiting and would laugh it off when I confront her and gaslight me to say she have to talk loud else ah ma can't hear etc.It's all nonsense and endless. She only changed into a different person after I got married and moved out of the house. She start to use the same fake persona when she is talking to my brother, to talk to me after I'm married. How can I forget how crazy she been acting for all those years? I know when I pissed her off she would hold a tight smile and walk away or say something else. It's the same kind of expression she uses when she is upset with my brother. She will go somewhere else to let go. She is incapable of communicating properly. I'm quite happy there's covid. I can reduce meeting or hearing from her. I find her concerns for me very fake. My brother didn't get the same treatment as me so he kept telling me to move on and says she asks about me all the time. Huh? She totally forgot how she treated me when I was living with her? Wow. It's very easy for outsiders to say move on. I am very clear on my stand that I have been subjected to ill treatment for many years. And the person who damaged me have no recollection of doing all those things to me? I still get triggered when she text me like we have a very dear relationship with her using all the emojis like we are besties while growing up. We don't have such a relationship at all. It's like she is living in another reality. She don't remember any of her past behavior. I can only say, only if you have lived through this kind of mental torture, else you would never be able to understand. Too easy to just tell someone to move on and expect you not to react or get triggered when your pain is never acknowledged. My husband said he believes I have forgiven her else I wouldn't even show up for xmas, cny, birthdays. I just didn't forget.-#102644: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102644",17 ,5 ,0,39,0,17,0,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#102626,2022-03-25,"tl;dr: Being forced to use manipulative dating techniques to get a girlfriend as a guyRelationship advice perhaps. Ive been in the dating scene for some time but I am wondering if I am getting it wrong here. Background: I was someone who couldnt get a gf anywhere for pretty much the first 21 years of my life, and I always tried my best to be like a good friend to my female friends in general, and to girls that I liked, it was the same. Generally, I tried to do it the 'proper way' like just tried my best to be there for them and text them as often as I could, and always respected physical and verbal boundaries when I was with them, and when I confessed after knowing them and confirming I did have interest in them, I would always be friendzoned.So at like the second year of uni, I was starting to feel jaded and I decided to ask and learn from my other friends who pretty much were dating all the time, and they werent exactly very good looking either. I cant remember all the advice they gave, but some were like, asking girls questions about what you should buy, even though you already know what you want, keep commenting on their looks even though you dont really feel like it, and to use playful touches when with them, and keep bumping into them when you are walking with them, and purposely time and phrase your messages to keep the interest. And the key they said, is to do it early on before you become friends. I hated the idea of doing all these as they felt so manipulative, and I believed that you have to actually like the person first and be honest with your feelings all the time.But one day I gave up and decided to use the above few techniques on a girl that I met online, I wasnt that interested in her at that time, but I decided to yolo and do those on our second meeting. And guess what, that was how I found my first girlfriend. The love did eventually come, but I felt so uncomfortable to be doing those ""manipulative"" actions to someone I didnt even know well yet. We have since broken up after a year due to other reasons. And now that I am back into the dating scene at age 24, I tried to date/woo others through the way I think was right, being a good friend first before going further, and so far all failed, and that one other girl that I manage to date for like 2 months was gotten through using the ""manipulative"" techniques. So yes, is that how dating works? Are women so superficial at the start of the relationship? I am sure the eyes do get opened in the end, but is being crafty and calculating at the start the only way to get a girlfriend? Would like to get some views.-#102626: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102626",31 ,11 ,0,0,20,26,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

#102641,2022-03-25,"My boyfriend and i have been in a rs for about 2 years and throughout the whole rs, i felt safe and secure when i am with him, he never fail to reassure me whenever i felt insecure, he will always try his best to ensure that i am not neglected.However recently, i found out by chance that he has been emotionally cheating on me by s**ting with other girls on multiple platforms for a few months. I confronted him about it and he revealed to me that he has certain fetishes and kinks thus he did what he did... he told me that he never meant to hurt me and he loves me very much and that he did not think of much at that point as he remained anonymous through out the whole s**ting situation. Honestly i don't know what to feel and do because how can u say that u love me when u know very well that the actions u chose will hurt me at the end of the day? I know that there will be a lot of people who will think that it isn't that big of a deal because 1. he did not meet up with other girls 2. he did not cheat on me physically 3. it was anonymous. However, please do not invalidate the way i feel because it still did hurt me a lot emotionally... i still love him a lot and i don't know how can i ever trust him again. After the whole situation i decided to give him a chance as i still love him and i am willing to rebuild trust he broke but there are still times where i feel overly insecure. When this happens, he will always try his best to reassure. Often, i will try not to bring up about that past situation because i know it will cause a lot of unhappiness and arguments but whenever we quarrel i will always worry and overthink that he is doing the same thing again and i cant seem to stop my mind from thinking that way. How can i stop it? There are also nights when those thoughts seem too affect me till the point where i cannot function and i will cry myself to sleep because i am afraid that i will lose him and that i am not enough.

#102637,2022-03-25,"My BFF got married about 3 years ago. Everytime when I meet her she will say demeaning things about her husband. Things weren't so bad when she was dating him. She is the only child and her husband actually was willing to live together with her parents under one roof when they got a new place. I think he should be a nice guy coz I don't believe many son in laws will be willing to do this.Now she will complain about how useless he is. He always wants sex. Can't do chores properly. Say his hobbies are stupid. His shopping purchases are ridiculous. Don't know how to appease her when she's mad with him. Basically she will keep saying how unhappy she is with him. The amount of negativity is affecting me. Makes me wonder if it's worth it to get married at all. Makes me wonder why did she get married to him if she hates him so much. I know my friend is a very fussy and controlling person to begin with. I've holidayed with her before and she was controlling af. So I stopped going on oversea trips with her because I'm a very nuah person. I don't want to abide by 20 rules when I'm sharing a hotel room with her. She is a very loyal friend though, that's why we are able to be friends for so long. I wanted to mind my own business and just let her rant to me. Until I realise not only she is talking to me about her husband this way, she is talking to him in a demeaning way in public too. Once he picked her up and he was running late. When he arrived, she just openly let go at him, in front of me. I find it embarrassing for him that she didn't even give him face in front of her own friend. And this was not once but a few times whenever he shows up. I know it's not my business but her rude behavior towards her husband is really starting to affect me. I don't believe this is normal. Where's the basic respect? Would it be inappropriate to tell her to be kind to her own husband? At least in front of me. I find her behavior veering on the abusive side already.-#102637: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102637",41 ,9 ,0,8,0,39,0,13,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

They seem uncomfortable talking about personal stuff even during casual settings like during lunch.Even after working for a year, some colleagues still don’t even open up.

I now am not sure if I should consider a jump at this point of time, especially since the difference is so huge that it is going to take much more time compared to my 1st jump.I'm also worried that it would be a decision I made without giving enough consideration and come to regret it.

After I've known her well enough I find out she's actually not a trustworthy person. She has cheated on my brother a few times throughout the course of their relationship.and my brother had always forgiven her. Our family is pretty well to do and my brother proposed to her with a 1 carat diamond ring when he finished reservist. Her family has some money too so I don't really believe she is with my brother for the money but I may be wrong.My mom was a business woman and had sold her business before she had passed away around the time when we are in our teens and the girl was my brother's gf then so the gf had been his lifesaver from self destruction during that hard time. I felt my brother was using that hard time of grief to convince to himself that he should marry this girl. My dad has his own separate business and has always been distant towards my brother after mom passed away. So I feel I am the only one holding the family together.The girl actually cancelled the engagement after a few months. My brother was determined that she will change her mind. The girl's parents threatened to kick her out of the house and forced her to continue the marriage preparations. When I met her and talked to her about it, if she wanted to return the ring, what's going on, she didn't plan to return the ring and told me she actually don't love my brother anymore but she will try and make it work. I told my brother what she said to me but he didn't believe me. He accused me of trying to mess up his wedding and ruin his happiness. I believe he knows she doesn't love him anymore but he was determined to 'own' her.   She may have been ok when they just started, but she's completely different now. I don't want such an awful woman to marry my brother or be my sister in law. Why can't my brother see something is so wrong? Its not love, it's like a trade and they are selling their daughter to my brother for money or something. I felt even if I show my brother a video proof of her cheating, or audio proof of what she said to me, he also may not believe me.So many red flags when the girl ask my brother to get a landed house or condo near her parents. Her parents also suggested to him to pool money together to buy a landed house in town so all of them can stay together. My dad opposed and offered to get the couple a condo near us instead.I don't know if anything will change if I tell my father. Or will anyone believe me. Am I overthinking?

She filled up the gaps when my priorities were obviously on our child and house. I kept the house clean and tidy, ensuring they are both always fed during meal times, bought all necessities for the house. He paid for everything else for all the monthly household expenses, i never had to worry. But I neglected his mental needs. He wanted attention from me but knew I'm always attending to my needy toddler. Being athletic, he loves running he love outdoor activities. He was a doting husband no doubt. But he found himself getting more lonely. We have been talking since a few nights ago, tonight he finally opened up. He's not the type who speaks up when unhappy but I told him calmly I wanna listen to his thoughts, not what he wants to do to redeem his deeds. After 2 nights of confrontation, tonight I told him I can forgive but I'll never forget. I'll slowly pluck out that thorn and hope it will be filled with his acts eventually. I'm not perfect either, to save this marriage, I have to take that step back. We promised to work out the differences together.Msg to all wives: I hope you'll never encounter something like this. I never thought I would either. I hope this major test will make our love and marriage even stronger, and make sure the husband's needs don't get neglected even after having children.

I assured her he is still her friend, and it's not uncommon some people may feel that they are not assigned to the gender they are born to.Sometime later, I got a call from the boy's mother. I got a scolding from her. She said my child has been calling her son the wrong name and said he's not gay. She was offended and said my child should use his rightful name which is a boy's name.

Apart from that, we rarely met on other days of the week because of work and we stay relatively far from one another (1 hour train ride). Last month he got covid and was stuck at home over the weekends so we didn’t meet. When he recovered and resumed work on Monday, I asked if he was free to meet earlier on Tues/Wed/Thurs because I missed him and wanted to check on him but he say not possible due to work. Then i realised that he had half day off for the entire week as his project had completed and he planned to stay home and rest or gym with his friends instead. This really bummed me out as I miss him and I’m worried for his health but he don’t seem to understand. I asked him about it and he say Im being clingy. He doesn’t see any issue since we are meeting on Friday as usual. I didn’t think that asking to meet just 1 more day in the week is demanding considering we are only meeting a few hrs a week and similar issues has been happening over the last 3 years. Each time he claim he needed his ‘own time and space’ or is busy at work but always have time to gym with his buddies. Even on special occasions such as valentines, anniversary and our birthdays, we will only celebrate it on the same week or the week after, and never on the day itself unless it falls on the dates we are already meeting on. We are only meeting an average of 8-10 hrs a week and he still claims he need his own space? Should i just help him and not exist in his life then?Am I the issue or is he the one with an issue?-#102608: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102608",17 ,5 ,0,2,0,7,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1

She told me she is a fan of a sport that I like but I found out she actually doesn't understand most of the jargon and lingo used. She told me she exercises 4,5 times a week like me but sorry to say, her figure looks more like someone who binge watches Netflix 4,5 hours a day. I try to take a pinch of salt when I see the photos but she over edited hers too much. It's like she brushed away half of her body. I can take it as I made a new friend but I don't appreciate the amount of lying. Not cool man. She told me she's a sporty girl when she's obviously not.And what's with the ton of make up and mountain of fake eyelashes? It's so distracting and vulgar looking. I don't know why some girls think it's attractive. I admit I'm not a 10/10 but at least I don't lie about who I am. What's the point of lying about your looks and interests when the truth will be revealed when we meet? What a waste of my time. It's impossible to meet anyone decent.

#102596,2022-03-23,"Hi Prof Ben,I am in my late 20s. Been working for 4 years at my first job after graduating from NUS. My colleagues are great and the work is fine. My partner and I just got married and we bought our first house. Everything in my life is more or less ok.I speak to many friends who are in the same life stages and we all share the same sentiments - our life is okay lor. But somehow there's this deeper nagging feeling inside us that we could be doing more with our lives and living our lives with more passion and enthusiasm and purpose instead of going through the motion. Sometimes I think about how the typical Singapore story plays out - study hard to get degree, find a partner, married, buy house, have kids.etc etc and I feel like.....wah very sian leh when I think about the future. It feels so predictable and safe. When I chat with my friends, we do share a yearning to explore and chart our own paths. I have a friend who has a pretty good job but she is thinking of leaving her company to travel for awhile to take break. She can afford it but she is afraid to do so because she is scared she cannot find a job after that. Another friend finally got a long-awaited overseas posting (his long-awaited dream) but declined it cos he scared he cannot adapt well overseas. As for myself, I want to pursue a career switch into mental health as I realised I care very much about supporting others as I've walked the same path too. But I am holding myself back because I think to myself why risk giving up all that I've built in my career now to pursue a passion/desire/yearning that I am not sure will sustain me financially? Will I ever be good at it?Scared we cannot pursue our passion, scared we will never get to meet the right person for us want to have our own freedom and do our own things but also scared never spend enough time with parents cos they getting older. Everything also scared to do. And somehow, after starting to work, I feel like life moves really fast and there's no time to catch my breath. Sometimes when I sleep at night, I'm scared I don't have enough time to do all the things I wish/hoped I could do with my life. Want to do something with my life also scared, don't do something also scared. Really jialat. I'm really scared to speak out too (in office, in public or on online space) although I feel very strongly when someone is doing something dumb or wrong, or when I feel like I truly got things to say. I grew up in the era when the teachers would ask at the end of the class whether got any qns and the whole class is silent. But after teacher leaves, we all start buzzing around amongst ourselves and sharing our confusion. Haha. All don't dare to speak out.  Is life supposed to feel so confusing and tough when we're younger and will it ever get better at some point later on?We all live such good lives (objectively speaking) but deep down I feel that most of our life choices are made out of fear rather than a true passion/love/desire. There's nothing wrong with this. But I feel kinda tired of living this way. I am ok with my life being ok, but I think I want something more. A life with a little bit more purpose and meaning.I know of a couple of friends my age who passed away in the last few years due to illnesses and accidents. It is a very sobering reminder that life is indeed very short and any of us (regardless of age) can go at any time. And when that point comes, I wonder how many of us will truly be proud that we have led a good and meaningful life. Prof Ben, I'm sharing this here because I believe some people might be able to relate too and can benefit from your wisdom and advice. I have a genuine question for you:How can we be more brave with our lives? When all we feel is fear and anxiety, how do we tap on our deep courage and resilience to move forward with our lives?-#102596: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102596",29 ,42 ,0,33,0,148,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
#102602,2022-03-23,"My husband has a s** addiction issue. What should I do?When we were dating I know his past gfs were all of a different nationality. I was his first gf of the same race as him. We were together for 6 years before getting married. All along I didn't notice anything amiss about him. We have a typical safe and secure relationship I guess. He makes me feel safe. He respects me. He is filial to his parents as well as mine. He is kind to people around him including the cleaners. He doesn't judge or say anything bad about others. He is smart. He has a good career path planned out and he knows what he wants to achieve in life and he involves me in all his plans. To me, he is perfect.When I was pregnant with our first child, I discovered that he had been visiting prostitutes throughout my pregnancy. Not just any type of prostitutes. But a particular type. It was such a rude shock to me and I almost delivered my baby early. I cried a lot before and during the initial months after the birth of our child and I fought with him a lot. He confessed to me he has an addiction. He thought he had gotten over it after we are together but the urge came when I was pregnant and he couldn't control himself. We went for therapy and he also attended therapy for his fetish. I chose to forgive him and start over. More than 5 years later, I thought we have put this behind us. But recently he confessed to me he reoffended again not once but several times recently. He couldn't bear the guilt of hiding it from me so he told me. He beg me to go with him for counselling again. He didn't want to lose me.I am so heartbroken and I feel so lost right now. I thought of separation because I feel I am going mad just having him in the same house. At the same time I feel and wonder how can I help and support him. I love and hate him so much now. I feel so lost. If you're an addict, will you ever get over it? Is there hope for us? I don't think I can go through this again. We only have 1 child. I chose to not have more in case he hurt me again and he did. I have my own career so I do not feel stuck in the marriage.

Happened a while ago. We were a clique of 5 people. Despite knowing full well I was attached and on the verge of bto, one of the guys decided to try his luck and confess to me telling me he liked me for a long time. I just feel so shocked and angry as to why he would do something like this, overstepping boundaries and not giving a hoot as to how it would affect us??Naturally the only possible thing i could do was to reject him as kindly as possible and put distance between us out of respect for my own partner. Made it clear to him that I valued him tremendously as a friend and was very sorry that I was the reason behind him feeling sad.What made it feel worse was the fact that this person who confessed is kinda like the glue holding the remaining 4 of us together. I felt so much judgemental vibes I got from the remaining 3 people in the clique making me feel like I was the reason why the entire clique was broken up. Eventually, the 4 of them unofficially kicked me out and are continuing the friendship on their own and looks like they are pretty tight. Friendships are super important to me and I value my friends like crazy.

There is nothing good in the school to be boastful about. If you wanted to become a staff in the school, and if the position you applied for is not high, you would become the stepping stone for almost all the rest of the departments. Namely, the so called management staffs who are terrible at managing, the administrative staffs who used threatening emails to force staffs to take up work and unnecessary courses, the human resource  who used emails from long ago where the rules setter had left to coerced other staffs into taking up extra duties. Knowing the situation, the so called management does not know how to maneuver themselves out of this situation and continues the tradition where old staffs are retiring or forced into resignation.-#102598: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102598",0 ,3 ,0,0,1,13,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0
#102600,2022-03-23,"I am still in dilemma whether I did the right thing or not. Would appreciate your honest opinion.I confronted a lady who was trying to rekindle with my husband. Although the messages exchanged weren't romantic, I could see that she was playing victim and helpless to seek some comfort from my husband. I told my husband that I did not like the way she was texting him as she was clearly seeking attention. She was my husband's ex way before my husband and I met. My husband broke up with her as he did not find her a wife material. I read all their past messages and I could clearly see the difference in how he was with her and how he is with me. Because he was the one who initiated the break up, he wanted to stay as friends for namesake (nothing happened between them- not even a kiss). So when I saw their messages I started getting annoyed. It was mostly her initiating the chat. I wrote to her saying that I am his wife and would like to speak to her. I think she was scared coz she then messaged my husband who told her that any wife would be upset if they discover that their husband is chatting with their ex. I don't understand why she did not pick up my call to try and resolve it but play victim to my husband saying that I am disturbing her. I only called her twice (9am and 10 am). If I were causing problem in a marriage and the wife were to message me, I would call her and tell her that I am sorry and cut off any link I have with my guy friend. I don't think my friendship is that important than that friend's marriage. Did I do the right thing by telling her to not message my husband? My husband on the other hand is quite chill and unbothered whether I block her or delete her number coz he said her presence is not important for him. For the record, I did not use any slangs or harsh word against her when I wrote the message. It was very polite introduction where I simply wrote that I am this person's wife and do you have a minute to talk.-#102600: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102600",25 ,6 ,0,17,0,51,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

As much as I don't wish to share this, I just need your opinion on this matter.My partner is 4 years older than me. As a working adult, he is extremely hardworking in his line of work. On the weekends, I often travel over to his location which is a 30 minute grab ride from my place. Due to the covid situation, he does not like going out that much and I decided to be the one travelling over to his place instead. Yes, I am the one who spends more money despite being a student in university and him being a full-time working adult. As a matter of fact, I do not have much savings on my end. I am often the one asking him out and checking in to see if he is free on certain weekdays just so that I can travel over to spend more time with him and have lunch/dinner together as his place. He rarely initiates asking me out on dates. Our 'dates' are mostly at his house which consist of us watching movies and him taking naps on his bed. Whenever we do message, he might take up to 8 hours to reply a simple message that I sent from my end. I always give myself the excuse saying that he is very busy with his work which results in his delayed responses.Even though we are together for almost 3 years, I don't even feel comfortable telling him how upset I feel with regards to his behavior because of his seemingly cold and distant personality.-#102597: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102597",40 ,3 ,0,4,0,15,0,10,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

I didn't move on with uni study as I need money and my family could not afford it. Recently, I have been pondering about whether or not should I further my studies and get a degree so as to be able to advance further in my career and earn a higher salary and eventually get into a management role. Recently, the company sent an email to all staff about a programme for further studies and it piqued my interest. On one hand, I really would like to do so but on the other, I really have no idea what I should study (engineering or management-related?) and sometimes I just don't feel the urge to want to study especially since I work shifts and prioritise rest and relax on my days-off and leave days.

But every time he goes for his reservist, he would change to become someone who is a misogynist, sexist and gives off a lot of crude remarks and won't minced his words about things he don't like.Recently, he had came back from his reservist. Throughout his reservist, he kept sending messages about him trying hard to resist the temptation to smoke with his buddies and bond with them (he is a non-smoker), as well as sending photos of pretty girls and influencers on our common group, which consists of both guys and girls, one of whom was his ex-girlfriend, but they are still friends apparently even though they have broken up few years ago. It was the first relationship for the both of them, and I knew that he wasn't very committed into the relationship as he find her to be conservative and close-minded, not willing to talk about sex.When I texted him to ask him why would he wants to send photos of pretty girls to our friends' group, he replied that he don't really know why, and sent it out of boredom. He then later felt that he wanted to send such pictures to spite his ex-girlfriend because she was fat and ugly, and not someone that he would date with. He told me that in his relationship with her, he regretted getting together with her and he is kind enough to give her a chance for a relationship, and thus he went onto dating apps to kill time.I knew that after he broke up, through dating apps, he went out with another girl, but the girl was similar in terms of look to his ex-girlfriend. Out of courtesy, he went on a dinner date with her, and I received a text from him saying that he was disappointed with this girl for being fat, short and ugly and disgusting and he wanted me to help save him from this girl. I blue-ticked him because I was busy with my own stuff, but later realised that he was not so nice as what he claims. I think I saw a post on here about a girl meeting someone on a dating app who blocked her after a date because he find her to be not someone he would date, and found this very familiar somehow.Is there any way to help him?

Because of my mother's life choices, I do not have a relationship with my relatives too.I grew up watching other children with a complete family while my home is just me and my mom. I remember asking her why there is only the 2 of us while my friends have a father. My mom told me my father died when I was a baby so I eventually stopped asking. My BC only had my mom's name and I took after my mom's surname and I've always wondered why.My mother is a street smart and capable woman so she always made sure I have enough to eat and live comfortably.

I am proud of his achievements and am very proud to call him my husband. I'm a highly self driven woman myself and have rejoined the workforce after spending a few years with the children with the support of my husband and family.He has many friends due to his profession. Being good looking, he is popular too. Sometimes I know when a girl has a crush on him. I've made effort to be more involved in his life to know his friends and have made many meaningful friendships along the way. Recent years I've come to notice he knows a girl much younger than him. Because he holds sort of a mentoring position, it's not uncommon for him to know younger people. Besides he has younger siblings so I am not surprised he can get along easily with younger peers. .A few times I have seen how the girl interacts with him. And I don't have a good feeling about it. My husband doesn't hides his phone from me. Once I chanced upon seeing their text conversations. I felt this girl is emotionally attracted to my husband. I didn't like how the girl was sharing about her family life, relationship problems with my husband. And how she described why he can do things for so and so but cannot do this for her? She sounded like a needy whiny self entitled little bitch. I know if his own real flesh and blood sister whined like this, he could have slapped his own sister's head. But he entertained this girl.Because of this girl, I had a huge fight with my husband. I have told my husband a few times how I felt about this girl so he knows I don't like this girl around us. I also found out he had lunch with her alone before. Our fights affected the kids so I tried to calm myself down but I made him agree that he is not to spend anymore alone time with this person. The girl is treating my husband like some emotional security blanket. My husband tried to say he only treated her like a sister because she looks up to him. She got no father figure in her life, poor thing. I told him he got a real life sister, how about he go show his real sis some concern instead of focusing on an outsider?! Only when I ask him how would he react if I were to do the same as him, then he agree he should cease frequent contact with her.I think the girl sensed my displeasure, then she tried to add me and my hub to a trio group chat to show me that she got nothing to hide? I don't have plans to know her better or be her aunt agony so I excused and removed myself.I was relieved when covid came. We don't hear from her much and my husband has slowed down responding to her. Then her texts came lesser and lesser. Recently we heard from her again. Someone in her family passed away and she contacted my husband. I didn't want my husband to go alone so I made time and went with him so she don't have a chance to be alone with my husband. Her expression when she saw my husband, then when she saw me with him. Priceless. I suspect she was hoping he would turn up without me. I don't believe my husband is cheating on me with her nor do I believe my husband wanted her. But I don't accept how some young women can be so oblivious and ignorant and selfish in their behavior towards someone's else husband. Thinking they have some right to another woman's husband! Yes you tell everyone you do not have any desires for my husband but what does your behavior towards him say about you? Wait till you have your own husband, spend decades building your marriage with him, bear him children, grow old with him, then watch some needy xmm dance along and try to make your hubby some personal rescue knight in shining armour and dance to your tune. My sil (my husband's sister) say I should just confront her and end the friendship once and for all. But I don't want to damage my husband's reputation and cause more problems. I can't remove her completely but I can always show up when she tries to see my husband. Any other smarter move to get rid of this person?-#102578: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102578",56 ,12 ,0,16,8,84,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

#102574,2022-03-21,"Hi, I was ART tested positive on 17 Mar in clinic with symptoms. The doctor mentioned that MOH would SMS me in 24 hours. Without receiving MOH SMS after 24 hours, I called to clinic making sure my case was submitted and record was sent to me. I called MOH HRP hotline and the buddy told me my case was not updated due to some glitches. We talked for 30min with my broken voice to fill in a form and escalate my case to primary case under protocol 2. Another 24 hours without update on Healthhub and SMS, my second call to MOH informed me to wait another 24hours. My symptoms really made me so weak to call. On Monday (my day 5) without any update or SMS (I am still on self isolation, and i lost my taste on day 4 till now) , my third call to MOH almost drove me mad. I got same reply by third buddy that my case was not escalated, and went through another 30min to fill in the same bloody form. My concerns are:1. Without escalating my case to primary protocol 2, I cannot call in to request recovery memo for travel purpose (recovery memo will not be issued for normal protocol 2 cases). Understand that MOH is busy with increasing cases, but my friend who was tested positive one day before me at QTC has received SMS and update on Healthhub on same day of testing. Anyone experienced the same problem? 2. What if those who do not receive any HRP SMS/ status update on Healthhuv going around here and there then spreading the virus to anyone? 3. Anyone lost your taste and how long will it recover? Google told me  loss of taste is not common though not impossible for Omicron, perhaps 3-6months, but would like to know any similar case locally. 4. The doctor in the clinic mentioned that he can issue to me recovery memo after day7 but not sure if any difference for memo issued by MOH and by clinic doctor, for travelling purpose?-#102574: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102574",0 ,10 ,0,3,0,7,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#102576,2022-03-21,"Is an ectopic pregnancy really not viable anymore, and is it not worth arguing with your partner about whether to keep it? The thing is, even before I found out that it MIGHT BE an ectopic pregnancy,  my partner has made up his mind not to keep it because, according to him, we are not financially ready to have a kid now, and ''It’s not a sentient life yet, it’s just cells still in the early stage of formation'', so there's nothing wrong in terminating now when it's at this stage.He said his intention was to ROM end of this year, and we can plan for a kid after (i did not know about his plan until he revealed it to me after i told him about the positive pregnancy test). But what is the difference between now and the end of this year? Isn't it just 9 months away and just in time for the baby? Couldn't we start preparing now? We are both not getting younger. I'm in my early 30s, and he is older than me, closer to 40 than 30 . The reason why I said it might be an ectopic pregnancy is because I have been bleeding since day 1 when I found out about the positive pregnancy result. I was spotting quite a significant amount of blood on day 1, and when the doctor did a scan, he could not see anything in my uterus (empty uterus). The doctors were unable to rule out or confirm ectopic pregnancy because of my 4 positive urine hcg result and 2 positive bhcg blood result (my results were not increasing like in a normal pregnancy) but empty uterus during the transadominal and transvaginal scan. So now it's just unknown location and unknown viability.The doctor called it a biochemical pregnancy because the pregnancy was known only because of the positive test results (5 positive urine and 2 positive blood tests) .  I have been bleeding ever since I tested positive ( as heavy as normal menses). Sometimes I wished I have never tested ( i only tested because i was 2 plus weeks late) and I would have just bled the next day and assumed it was just menses and this argument wouldn't have happened and I wouldn't have been so  attached to the idea of what could have been having a baby.  I can't discuss this with my family because they are religious and do not condone premarital sex.My question is: Is this whole argument about whether or not to keep it moot now since it is most likely an ectopic pregnancy?-#102576: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102576",26 ,2 ,0,11,0,9,0,6,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I went up to sleep. The police came at 7am because the owner reported to the police that it was a hit and run and my car is still there. So the police came to my house and my housemates let them enter, which is how they ended up in my room. It was no injury , superficial scratch. Police took pictures and I had to go to court few months later. The white scratch marks on my car can we wiped off with wet wipes after the police interview. I did an out of court  settlement with the owner for $500 for the scratch marks but the owner still insist on pressing charges. That’s why it made it all the way to courts and then I had to plead guilty for the 3 charges. I wanted to fight back for the fail to remain and report charges but I had no knowledge of the accident in the first place. I told my HR about this incident , citing that during the work background check , it didn’t mention about traffic conviction. HR said they will need to do more checks before getting back to me. Hence my concern since i know people do make mistakes , I learnt from this incident.

After having lunch at a nice restaurant or crappy place, the guy (if he wasnt a cheapskate) would usually cover the bill, and then we'd part ways with a reason and she'd text back the guy ""I had a good time, but didn't really feel a connection.

Didn’t know it occurred until the police entered my room at 7am when I’m still sleeping. And then I had to go to court. Could not afford a lawyer to defend so pleaded guilty to - careless driving , fail to report an accident and fail to remain at scene. Didn’t know it even occurred until the police were in my room few hours later. I was fined and got a few penalty points. But I didn’t lose my license at all. So moving forward , I accept a job offer with one of the Big 4 Accounting firms , and am due to start working next month. But they just did a back ground check and said that I have a criminal conviction which I didn’t declare. I said that when I was applying for the job and filling out the declaration, they asked me to declare any convictions not relating to traffic conviction . Since I didn’t have any other convictions, so I said nope.

She ended up showing me her black face, saying she will just let the fish die of hunger and walked off.The worms are frozen and sealed, and would not contaminate the fridge if handled properly.

Recently this married colleague have been treating me exceptionally well, ie buying coffee and breakfast for me, going an extra mile to help me with my work, initiating small talks in office, complimenting my work and outfits, offer to drive me home since it’s on the way (I have never accepted it btw). He also commented that my little habits, way of talking etc are “cute”. Whenever I OT to settle my work, he will say he needs to OT too. And when I leave on time, he will leave on time too. I don’t see him treating the other female colleagues like that.All the while I’ve never really interacted with him 1 on 1 before. Lunch and discussions are usually with the rest of the colleagues. Texting-wise is also in the branch group chat. The only time we ever interacted alone was during the first two weeks of work where he was assigned to guide me along. I’ve also never responded to him excessively, just the usual polite replies to a colleague. So I don’t think I’ve given him any wrong signals. I told him about it, that he is married, and I am uncomfortable with him treating me like that, and that I don’t want other colleagues to get the wrong idea. He acknowledged and said he will cut down on it, but after a few days he started over again. I’ve tried telling him a few times, things never change. I can’t possibly ignore him too, I don’t want other colleagues to think I’m the rude and aloof newcomer.I don’t really know how to deal with this. I thought of telling my other colleagues or my boss. But I’m really afraid it will backfire since I’m new, while he is rather close to everyone since they have been colleagues for years. What if they don’t believe me, or worse, he turn the story around and said I started it. I’ve thought of doing recording or something, but I don’t think it will work because he didn’t do anything “exceptionally inappropriate”. I don’t want this to jeopardise my work here in any way because I really like this job.

As a senior I taught her some stuff, started a little flirting here and there. Things progressed, started messaging daily, started having nicknames for each other, she bought little treats for me randomly left on my table/drawers which really made my day. Even bought a bigger item and wrote a card for me last year. Did the same for her, daily messages became mass flirting: how her day was bad cus i was on leave, spamming photos of me when i didnt notice just to send me afterwards with flirty captions? Had dinner tgt a few times which i felt went really well, walked her all the way home once even and she waited with me for my bus. Even sneaked in some things in my bag without me knowing. I thought it was really sweet but damn do i hate myself for still feeling happy about it now.Now all of a sudden she starts distancing herself? No more random pop ups at my table, no more little treats. She takes days to reply messages now, although still rather cheery and not a dead reply. Leaves me hanging for days when I try to arrange another date. The worst part is that when I do see her in office she acts like nothing happened, still appears to be really happy to see me and I still stun her sometimes (a sign that i thought meant she liked me, eg. she gets a little flustered when she's in a call and i suddenly appear). Should have known it would turn out this way when I saw her social media. Filled with solo photos with other guy ""besties"". ""Thanks for inviting me to comm ball bestie!!"" ""Happy birthday to the best guy bitch I know!!"" Yes, she is ""that"" girl. I wonder if that triggered any PTSDs in any of u male readers.

#102545,2022-03-18,"Hmm really don’t get why some people still have children when they clearly do not have the ability to be good parents emotional wise. My parents condemn my siblings and I for very small mistake we make as if it would never happen to them. It could be something simple like forgetting to put my shoes away and they would literally shout at me asking me why am I like this. Even if it was a one-off thing on my part. Do they think I’m not human? And I am not suppose to make any mistakes in life? And if they do something wrong, they’d brush it off in a second. One time, my dad dropped my phone (which I bought myself just for context) by accident and the screen cracked. Instead of apologising to me, he blamed my phone for being too big and that’s why it slipped out of his hands. I’m not even angry because he dropped my phone but more so on how he never admits his own mistakes but makes a big deal over my every action. Like if you are going to make your child’s life so hard, why even have a child? Living in such a household really makes me feel like I’m on tenterhooks every single second. And if I really did something wrong by accident, I’d try to conceal it rather than be honest about it. So much that I realised I’m starting to act like this even outside of my home. Honestly, I don’t even know if this is an alarming sign of something I should seek help for.-#102545: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102545",23 ,11 ,0,19,0,43,0,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

And they don't approve of him because he is not from local background, even though he was born and raised locally. And because of this, they want me to stop seeing him, and even after multiple rounds of me talking to them trying to reason things out logically and getting them to try giving him a chance (like legit sit down f2f discussions), they are still quite against him, and are threatening to cut me off financially and possibly even kicking me out of the house if I don't listen to them. The reason I am conflicted is that I know that their views are bigoted and unjustified. And that part of me feels that I should not give in to them, and that I should fight for my love. Things have been nothing but amazing between my partner and I can really see myself marrying him. But at the same time, the other part of me feels that I should listen to them, because being brought up in an Asian society has ingrained in me values of filial piety, to not cause sadness/distress to my parents, and I won't be able to forgive myself if any happens to them or their health because of this situation. Also, for the most part, I have listened to my parents for most of my life because I know they have my best interests at heart. So, fighting for myself is a concept I am quite unfamiliar with. Of course, my partner is affected by this situation and the emotional turmoil it has caused me but he loves me so much that he can't bear to let me go because of this.Any advice? I'm at a loss at what to do, I know the big decision ultimately falls on my shoulders, and I'm leaning towards fighting for myself but I don't think I am able to stand up against my parents whom I love very much as well.-#102521: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102521",54 ,3 ,0,10,0,23,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I haven been working for the past 6 years, and as much as I love my current role (production planner), I am having doubt with my loyalty and my value in this company. Once regard as the best in the industry/Singapore, my company has really been treating us like s*it. Attrition has been so bad that almost the entire department is made up of new hire. People  are being promoted not because they are competent but management like them and they can speak/articulate the ""stories"" better. Opportunity are given to the boss favourite and not based on your specialities. Because higher up are being ""parachuted"" in, the working level end up having more gyration/working meetings/discussion so that they know the basis of what's happening. My promotion had been delayed because (1) other favourites deserved more and (2) the department needed someone to cover the favourite leaving. Despite getting this rotation eventually, I took ~2years more VS my peers. Sometime I also feel I should just underperformed or do the bare minimum so that I have more excuses to leave/get retrench (#yay to extra benefit under retrench policies) But again, I have been told/adviced that this is the best company to be in the industry (which I agree based on market size and presence) and stay for the money (which is also true as I am in the midst of purchasing a property). The only benefit this company give is rather adequate health policy and good bonuses. My current boss values me and is grooming me to be the next anchor, but with bosses moving faster than us, I doubt this will continue with new (parachuted) boss. I am in my late twenties and I trust that once my house is actually here, I will have more and more inertia to leave this daunting place.

#102501,2022-03-16,"6 years back when I was just out of jc, my boyfriend asked me to ""take a break from the relationship"" because he didn't do well for A levels and was planning on retaking it during NS. He refused contact and on that day immediately cut contact with me on the spot. I didn't have a say in this at all, I wasn't consulted at all either. I took it as a break up, blocked him everywhere and tried to move on. About 4 months into NS he suddenly came to my house and apologised and everything begging me to take him back. I decided to give him a chance after 2 months of his persistence, and we have been going out since. I found out recently that he was on tinder and seeing other girls during our break and he still kept in contact with some of them. So obviously I went to talk to him about it and tried to clarify things.He then told me that he knew that I'd slept with someone else on the day that we decided to ""take a break"" and that it ""was basically the same thing"". But bear in mind that this wasn't about him being on tinder, it was about him remaining in contact with these girls over the last few years. He said that they weren't flirting or anything (they were, I checked the messages) and that he'd never met them irl (he did, there were photos on his phone) and that since I slept with this other guy I wasn't supposed to complain either.So backstory on how I ended up in bed with the guy is that my boyfriend took the opportunity while my parents and brother were away to ""take a break"" because he knew my brother would definitely give him shit about it (FYI my brother tutored him for A levels because he was struggling). So that day I went out with one of my other male friends that I haven't seen in a really long time. He's one year older than me and in NS, and yes while he had some bad reputation for being a player he has been very supportive of me. That day we had too much to drink after I confided in him about the breakup and we ended up in my place having s**. That friend had remained supportive of me, never ask for s** again and didn't make any more advances at all even up till my boyfriend asked me to get back together at which point he willingly mentioned that we should probably stop seeing each other. It just seemed like a heat of the moment decision, and from how we've interacted in the past it wasn't like a pump and dump situation that I keep hearing people say he does. We don't have feelings for each other and he's since moved on to a stable relationship during his time in NUS while I rekindled the relationship with my boyfriend.So my boyfriend said that it was ""basically cheating"" and that this incident (that happened while he was ""on a break"") was worse than him consistently flirting with other girls during our relationship. I haven't spoken to that friend I slept with in over 5 years since we got back together. My bf tells them when we fight and says things like ""you don't seem as unreasonable"" or like ""you're much better tempered than my gf"" to them. Yet he somehow thinks he's not the one at fault and I'm the one who somehow owes him for this relationship.I'm considering breaking up with him, that's for sure, but I'd just like to know if everyone really thinks what I did is really ""worse"" than what he did?? He never asked what happened during our break and always insinuates that I'll never get another boyfriend if we break up. I'm definitely not ugly and definitely not unattractive, I hold a decent managerial role and I frankly take home more than he does (he failed A levels again and went on to do private uni a year late) even after contributions to my parents and family.It feels like he's just trying to keep me at this point and coming up with all sorts of bullshit to make me feel indebted to him and like diminish my self worth. That's definitely not going to happen, but I'm jst curious if what I did is really comparable or worse to what he's doing.Thanks in advance.-#102501: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102501",54 ,13 ,0,0,11,43,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

#102472,2022-03-16,"tldr: Advice for transitioning from mathematics into the tech industry / gaining CS knowledge?Hi Prof Ben,I am a Mathematics student graduating this year. Throughout my life I have always been interested in learning how things worked from ground up. So I focused on pure mathematics. I took courses in representation theory, algebraic geometry/topology, and more. I really enjoyed the content and I don't regret it at all. When I was first applying for uni, all these were promised in maths. I also looked at the CS courses at various universities, both local and overseas. I was expecting a slow and steady progression from first principles, the process of going from hardware to machine language, and then to high level programming languages. But looking at the course outlines told me that my expectation was far from reality.  So I abandoned CS and went with maths.After 4 years in maths, I realised that what is being taught in CS is a natural extension to maths. The more I look at the modules the more interested I am in them, but there are just too many things and I feel very lost. By extension of this I feel that working in the tech industry will be very exciting, particularly in math heavy areas like cybersecurity, data science, and artificial intelligence. But right now I am missing too much CS and programming knowledge and experience to make credible applications to graduate jobs and internships in these areas. I have tried looking online, but every other supposed ""guide"" says different things.Do you have a recommended progression plan for me, a pure mathematics student who wish to enter the tech industry? Do you have any other advice? My experience so far is minimal. I have only taken one introductory programming class in year 1. I have also tried doing questions on leetcode, but you mentioned in another post that grinding leetcode will not get someone very far.-#102472: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102472",7 ,1 ,0,0,0,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Even though it’s normal because relationships is usually the one that influence the individual the most. But what I cannot stand is how she managed to gaslight herself back into the relationship every time. In the many many times she mentioned she wanted to break up with him, I kinda figured he’s not mature enough and is just dating her out of convenience and loneliness. The way he disrespected her numerous times and how he failed to take care of himself makes me worry for my friend. But every time after the break up talk, things will magically get solved because she gave in to his tears and because she also need him for her loneliness.I used to give her advice to stand up for herself and stop giving in to the toxic relationship but after awhile I noticed how she became more and more disconnected because she knows I don’t like her bf but she still wants to be with him. So she decides to not share any more things about him and paint a picture perfect relationship that they have. But her life only revolves her bf so whenever I meet her, she has nothing to talk about. The kind of robot friend who only answers after being questioned. I even caught her lying to me about her life just so she could keep up with appearances. I feel so drained from this friendship and just want to cut her off since she became so fake. But there’s this nagging feeling that tells me to be a supportive friend and be there for her when she needs me. What would you do if your best friend suddenly becomes a stranger? Will you still wait for her to come around or will you burn the bridge and move on with your life?

#102458,2022-03-14,"Dear Prof Ben, I saw your comment about the importance of general intelligence in doing well in CS. May I ask if you think general intelligence/aptitude can be improved ? I really think it can be because people can get better at Leetcode problems and Leetcode problems resemble iq problems. Sure there are some ""practice effect"" and ""pattern recognition"" involved but after practising more leetcode problems, I feel that I could come up with logic that I was previously incapable of. Apart from the anecdotal evidence, there is also scientific evidence. Specifically, Khan academy made a video that iq can be improved because the neurons in our brain can increase following an intense mental workout and more neurons is highly correlated with intelligence. Hope springs that a hardworking CS student can slow and steadily improve his aptitude and general intelligence to match closer to that of the top students. Nonetheless, as someone who respects and looks up to you so much, I would really love to hear your opinion regarding this matter.

#102441,2022-03-13,"A lot of men like to complain that their wives & gfs have low s** drives, that they’re “never in the mood for s**”.Well guess what? Most women enjoy s**. We LIKE s**. But only when we are feeling comfortable, happy and in a good headspace. The problem with men is that they’re only affectionate & sweet only when they’re trying to get laid. When a man starts touching or kissing me, he’s not doing it to be sweet & affectionate, we both know he’s trying to get into my pants. I’m currently involved with someone, and I absolutely detest having s** with him. He’s overall a decent man, but he always makes it blatantly obvious that he EXPECTS s** whenever we spend time together. It’s the expectation that turns me off.Some days when I was totally not in the mood, or I got my period etc; and I say no. He reacted very negatively to this- his reaction ranging from sulking & huffing & sighing loudly next to me, to throwing tantrums and banging doors, banging things around, vocally expressing all his frustrations. But whenever he gets to have s**, he’s all sweet & nice again. Wow manipulative much? Like seriously if u start behaving like an asshole the minute my legs aren’t open for you, that’s when your true colors come out, and I lose all respect for you. I think I speak for most women when I say it’s a huge turn off when a man behaves like he’s entitled to my body. Like hello, I already grant you access to my body on a regular basis, and I have the right to say no to you occasionally when I’m not in the mood or not well. My body is not a all-you-can-eat buffet. So now, I totally have lost all my s** drive. I am dead & numb from the waist down. Whenever he wants s**, I just give in because it’s easier than dealing with his f***ing toddler tantrums. I just lie there like a dead fish and wait for it to be over. To be honest sometimes I even feel like I’m being used; and I feel so damn resentful towards him. I can’t wait to dump him and never have s** with a man again. He totally ruined my drive with his behavior. Absolutely appalling and disgusting. He’s made something that was supposed to be enjoyable into something that feels like a chore. So guys. If your other half doesn’t seem to be in the mood, PLEASE don’t force it. The worst thing you can do is react badly to her saying no, by reacting aggressively or even passive aggressively. Don’t even try to be subtle with a sour attitude. We can sense it. All we want to hear is, “It’s okay baby.. we don’t need to have s** today if you’re not feeling up to it. Let’s just chill okay?” It’s that simple. S** is so much more enjoyable when the other party is not SO hung up about whether he’s getting laid; and he just wants to spend time with me. If a man were to just offer me a back rub or foot rub after a long day without expecting anything in return, I think there’s a high chance I’ll actually want to jump him. A man who can fully respect boundaries and our bodily autonomy is rare; and that quality makes a man so attractive tbh. A man who can be affectionate, and touch me in non-s**ual way, is so much hotter than a desperate man who’s like constantly trying to burrow his way into my pants every single time he’s near me.

Because of his irresponsibility, my dad has now passed away from covid due to BIL's infection. While I am terribly upset, all the problems I envisaged and feared that would happen is now taking place - without a father figure in the house, my BIL has started to scream at his wife (my sister) and hit his son. BIL was previously an absent father and in the past my dad would give him a piece of his mind/pick up the slack if the BIL did not fulfil his duties. The whole house is now full of females (myself included), and I was always worried that if my dad isn't around to hold the fort, my BIL being a big and burly guy of 190cm would not respect anyone in the family. I've also seen BIL shouting at his mum in law (my mother). Now that my dad's gone, I'm at my wits end on how to protect my family, being the youngest and just a 160cm female.

#102449,2022-03-13,"I know my BFF for over 10 years. She seems to have difficulty finding a bf, let alone talk about marriage. She is a great and reliable friend. We have weathered through many crisis together. I can count on her to show up for me. We live near each other, so when there is an emergency, she will be the first one to show up too. She has a mean mouth but she has a heart of gold with it comes to me. I didn't tell her this but I think she don't make a good partner. She can be loud, she dresses provocatively, puts on a lot of make up, is very brand conscious and spendthrift and can be very needy towards a guy. Some of the things that she tell me about her relationships, I find it unbelievable that she would behave in such an irrational way. Mostly it's about her need to hold a higher position of importance than the bf's mother and show dominance towards the mother. I suspect it's a past trauma that she is repeating this behavior so it may be hard for her to stop assuming all the bf mothers are the same. Over the years whenever she meets a new guy, she tends to fail the future mother in law test. Many times the bf break up with her because the mother disapproved of the relationship. When I was younger and hanging out with her I was more unaware of why she cannot seem to get along with the bf's mother. Now I'm older I start to realise why. Because if I have a son myself, I wouldn't want my son to date or marry such a woman too. She is very frustrated with her lack of love life and call all these men mummy's boy. I am hesitant to tell her how I may view her from the eyes of a mother looking at a potential daughter in law. I did hint to her to tone down on the dressing and make up when she's meeting a new guy's mother. Once I even helped her pick the outfit and helped her style her make up and hair to look more girl next door. I also hinted to her don't be so quick to argue back when she hears something that she disagree. But she told me they better accept her the way she is else she won't waste time too. She has sort of given up on local men and start to focus on non local men but so far she hasn't been lucky too. Once she asked me point blank what she thinks is wrong with her. I don't think she is ready to hear my opinion because I don't want to hurt her feelings. But at the same time, since this is the first time she is asking me I think she may be ready to hear what I say. How do I tell her without upsetting her? I think she has problems passing the mil test is because of her dressing and the way she carry herself. She does not behave like a potential daughter in law. She does not help her bf save money. She is too spendthrift. She give the vibes that she thinks only about herself when she has a bf. And the most obvious one I think is her need to want to wear a larger crown than the bf's mother. No matter what, as her friend I am on her side. But in regards to this opinion I have no idea how to sugar coat it without upsetting her.

#102454,2022-03-13,"TLDR: Girl I'm seeing likes married menI've been seeing this girl for the past 6 months. I think she's a nice person and we have good chemistry and I am very attracted to her. I want to take things slow because I am very interested in her. I come from a broken family so I also want to make sure we are compatible before getting serious. We are not teenagers anymore so I understand that she's been in relationships before me. She did not talk much about her past but recently she revealed 2 of her previous bfs were actually married men. I was kind of taken aback by this information. I try to be objective and asked her how did she get into it and how did it end. Long story short, I didn't like her answers. In summary she was interested in them while knowing they are married. She also made the first move. The relationships ended because the affairs were exposed. She was dumped. I sensed a hint of triumphant  when she was describing the relationships.I grew up watching my father cheating and abandoning us. So I am rather triggered to hear her reveal that she had been the other woman. Not once but twice. A part of me is telling me this is not going to work. Another part of me is telling me I should give her a chance. She say she will not do such things again because it was mental torture and she has grown out of it. She wants to have an open and honest relationship from now on. Should I continue to see her? Do people really change? I don't want to invest and get hurt later on. Before knowing this I actually think she could be the one. Now I feel lost.-#102454: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102454",53 ,6 ,0,15,0,41,0,14,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#102456,2022-03-13,"I genuinely think the pandemic has fucked up my brain, and I’m not even the same person I used to be. I used to care about studying a lot, or about trying to be as social as I can (even though I do have social anxiety) In the two years of this pandemic, I’ve had 0 social life, pretty much. The only place I go everyday is to buy lunch. That’s it. Out of these 2 years, I’ve only seen my NS friends thrice. I have not stepped foot into campus for 1.5 years, and even though I have the opportunity now to go to campus again, it’s like I just don’t even care anymore. I don’t even care that much about my studies. I just do assignments to get it done. Take account into other things, like how I’ve never dated before and ‘worried about it’, and now I just don’t even care if I’ll stay alone. I don’t take care of my physical appearance anymore. I haven’t worked out in a year, don’t even bother getting haircuts. You know I was handling the pandemic relatively ok for like 5-6 months, but after the constant back and forth, and how it seems like we’ll never go back to pre pandemic ways, has just put me in a downward spiral. I have no ambition, no drive, nothing. I just want to finish my degree this year and start working next year.

#102435,2022-03-13,"My gf and I are in our early 30s. We have been together for 3 years. Our relationship has been mostly smooth. We are saving for our future together and agreed when our savings hit xxx amount we would get married. We don't have a joint account and only plan to join finances after marriage so we have been saving separately. We take turns to pay on dates since our income is similar. I don't find her stingy or calculative. She is generous and treats her friends often. I don't have an issue with that because I do the same and it does not impact our savings plan.The issue I have with her at times is about money. I'm quite tired of my gf comparing herself with her materialistic friends. Social media is so toxic. It felt like she is competing with others who have a richer and more capable bf. Sometimes it's so obvious her friends are just showing off and she actually cannot see through the nonsense. This Vday I got her a Gucci bag. I know she has been eyeing this design and colour for a while so I saved up for it to surprise her. I get her gifts from time to time, the cost is not expensive everytime. Sometimes I just get flowers and no gifts. She love flowers. She also surprises me with gifts that I like. The cost can range from a superdry shirt to a branded wallet or a surprise weekend staycation. We don't have an issue in regards to gifts that we give each other. She thank me for the bag and told me she love the gift but she mentioned one of her gf got a Rolex and she wonder if she will get one from me. My gf actually have a rolex prior to meeting me. I got myself one rolex too years ago. I don't see the point of owning more than 1 rolex. We are not watch collectors. I told her even if we get married I likely may not get her one because I think its better to spend it elsewhere. But I can consider doing an upgrade for her. Means she resell the one she has and she can keep the money since its hers and I'll get her a new one. She said ok she will think about it but she was in a sour mood for the rest of the day. I thought the rolex thing is over but it's not. Sometime later my gf talked about the rolex again. She said she thought about it and didn't feel that I am reasonable. She said I obviously can afford the watch without her reselling hers and I would rather make things difficult for her. I made my stand about finances that if she wants one from me I would want her to resell hers so the money is going somewhere useful. Besides, we are close to hitting our target savings amount. It means I will be proposing to her sometime soon. If I get the rolex now, it means the proposal will surely be delayed. She told me she don't want to delay our marriage and she also want the rolex.We don't plan to have children so we do not feel rushed to settle down. But the rolex issue did stumped me that this is one of the first time that we cannot see eye to eye. What should I do? Indulge her? Just get her the rolex? I still prefer that she resell if she wants me to get her one. I can don't get her the watch but I know I'm going to get hell for an undetermined length of time. Or I can just get her the watch to get this over and done with as I also don't find it worth to argue over this.-#102435: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102435",158 ,26 ,0,0,31,56,0,8,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

So really a big thank you to everyone who gave their advice like it or not. This led to some tears while reading them on my commute to work and it really made me feel like I was not that alone. *hugs to everyone out there* As with the advice of many, I have suggested to take steps in seeking for couples counselling/therapy with the full support of my partner to try to build a bridge between the both of us. I have come to realise that it is no longer a situation either of us can resolve and a mediator/neutral party is necessary for this to get anywhere. Whether or not it will work out, at least I’ve given my best shot. We’ve actually split up once because of this but somehow still found a way back to each other and I’d like to believe there is a reason for so. Re-reading my post from a moment of rage and frustration has also allowed me to see things from a different POV.

There were many screenshots of a micro-influencer and some pics and videos of other girls I don’t know. To be fair, I knew that majority of guys have this ‘issue’ - of finding a certain girl attractive whatnot and keeping pics of her for whatever reasons. I just never expected it to be him, since he’s the super logical and straightforward type. He’s also always caring, acknowledges me, emotionally supports and understands me, the all-around perfect boyfriend material so all this information really comes as a shock. Prior to finding out about the hidden album, we had a conversation where I expressed my discontent as to why guys like to keep pictures of random girls when they themselves have a girlfriend. He said no when I asked if he does it too, and even validated my point and how I felt, but he’s doing this all behind my back? He’s big on trust too - but after knowing this, it makes me view him as a hypocrite. He doesn’t know that I know, so he acts like nothing is wrong. And since he’s the type to openly communicate, I’m rather certain I’d be able to get answers, its just that I am in quite a dilemma because I don’t know whether to confront him (because my means of finding out isn’t exactly “ethical” per se) but I just feel super unsettled by this fact.-#102430: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102430",56 ,9 ,0,0,10,27,0,0,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

#102419,2022-03-13,"26(f) suffered from depression since a young age, been on medication for as long as I can remember, everyday was hell , especially when a really bad episode happens and the medication doesn't seem to do s***.Some time along my earlier years, I found what I thought was the perfect bf. Understanding, accepts my ""princess mode"" , and supposingly, because of me, actually found a job and got out of his jobless lifestyle(he was 20+ that time and was a jobless guy), he even promised me a ring within a year, a promise that he didn't keep, but I stuck with him.I still had depression episodes and I would make things difficult for him because of that. Over time, I could tell that the ""love"" he had for me, slowly changed into a form of obligation and guilt of not wanting to be the one who abandons a mentally ill person. Friends and family would try and show concern for me as I dwell in my own isolation, and I sadly rejected them all , something I regret up till this day. Reason being? I wanted that bf of mine to be the hero,the savior who would bring me out of depression and give me what I perceived as happiness, everyone else , no matter how capable, would be not given a chance to even try. I was afraid that if I accept their help , and they were successful, my bf would lose the role of being my hero, my savior. So I would rather isolate myself , shut out even my closest friends and family, spending what little time my bf has only with him. But sad to say, my bf is a regular person, fresh in the job, he barely has time to spend with me, don't get me wrong , he tries to spend most of his free time with me, but that is never enough for a depressed person who needs companionship A few attempts to try and end my suffering later, my bf also started to feel weary and decided to initiate a break. For months, I was pretty much dead on the inside and the depression got worst, suicide attempts were almost a weekly affair.But once I realized that my bf has long sinced moved on from me and got attached to a normal girl,and to make matters worst, he actually got married to her within a year of dating(we dated for 2years), I realized that everything that happened before, was because I was too blind to see that I was the one who needs to want help, to get out of my hell.Decided to give my current hubby a chance to date me, he has been one of the ones who was trying to break into my isolation and pretty much my ""simp"" all the way, and he turned out to be the actual ""one"" for me. My hubby quit a rather decent job and showed me what it means to actually have a meaning to live, a purpose. He started a small business with me to give me something to work on, pickings up all the loose ends when I would still have depression episodes and not want to do shit. Went on therapist sessions , repaired my broken family life by putting in effort to connect me to my family and countless things that my ex-bf could never do. I can never imagine life if he never waited for me all these years, even when I actually rejected him to be with that ""perfect"" bf. So my final words for all those suffering from depression, girls or guys, do not be so fixated on trying to let your partner be your savior, open up to others , you might see that someone else might be a much better candidate to bring you to the right path. The only way you can get out of suffering, is when you actually want help and let people help you. Getting stuck in a depression cycle is mainly due to being in a negative cycle with you yourself not letting people into your world. I still get depression once in awhile, but with the right partner who knows how to help, it always passes-#102419: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102419",9 ,9 ,0,27,0,85,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

He runs the house as if it's a company, with goal setting, performance evaluation and what not. Some of the crazy things he has enforced on us:- Bi-weekly sprint meetings and retros where we meet to discuss how far along we are in achieving in terms of our career growth, personal growth and fitness- Quarterly OKRs for our son who is in Primary school - He made our son set goals for his exam grades, e.g. 95 for English, 100 for Math, etc- He created dashboards to track our combined income and expenditure, goal progress, etc- Biannual performance review where we give each other feedback and he decides a rating for us. He will also give an overall family rating depending on our overall performance- Our family holiday locations and the budget are determined by our family rating. The higher the rating, the better the location (ranging from Maldives to Sentosa)- Every half, we do roadmapping and each of us have to also talk about how we envision ourselves and the family to be in the next few years and propose changes I'm a bit afraid for my son that he's growing up in such a stressful environment and have an abnormal childhood.

I have moved on since. So I can hi bye without hating him much.I notice he would call me everytime after he break up with a girl. I was naive and actually entertained him.

I admit it's my fault for not figuring the machine out and asking for help beforehand, but isn't this totally unreasonable??My assistant manager even scolded me harshly the day after (in front of customers btw), even when I already apologised so many times and offered for him to dock my pay to pay for the meal. He even purposely asked me to eat my lunch in the stock taking room whereas the rest of them ate their lunch outside. I'm pretty sure he badmouthed me to the rest of the employees too. I feel like this is so unfair to me, especially since all of them literally disappeared, leaving me alone to fend for myself. Furthermore it was my first F&B job, so I wasn't very familiar with the trade yet. Anyway, I quit the job after a month, I really cannot take the toxic environment. If I ever work in F&B ever again, I hope it will be a much better experience than this one.-#102402: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102402",44 ,7 ,0,26,0,41,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#102401,2022-03-12,"tldr i think my boyfriend is cheating on me, any advice?i (26F) have been dating a guy (27M) for 5 coming to 6 years, and i think he's cheating on me recently. a few weeks ago, i chanced upon his phone when he was bathing because it was blowing up with notifications and i got a little annoyed, so i checked it with the intention of turning on silent mode. but when i got hold of the phone, i noticed a lot of messages from a person saved as the heart emoji '' and no name beside it. i didn't confront him about it because i don't think i can handle it if he really is cheating on me.my main concern is also the fact that i'm not getting any younger. if i break up with him now, how am i going to find another boyfriend? and isn't it a waste of the 5-6 years i've spent with him? i still love him a lot and i hope he will stop the affair soon, but he doesn't seem to show any signs of breaking up with the other party. he even gives me stupid excuses like ""my mother is at home so you cannot come"" when i mention going over to his house to pass him food or drinks. i'm super at a loss right now.-#102401: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102401",96 ,15 ,0,16,15,41,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#102398,2022-03-12,"Hi I'm the OP of #102370Single-parent family cos our mum left us when we were in poly, she didnt ask for any maintenance, only the house.And who is paying the school fees?? We pay for it ourselves, through bursary and I still have shortfalls to top up, not totally free for us, and the food/transport and misc expenses I pay for it myself. Transport is getting ex too :< And sometimes I need to visit the dr, who pays?? All by myself.Why not live in hostel? I cant afford it, hostel is not cheap. And I have medications here and there, alot of stuff to bring. And partly cos my sis alrdy staying in rm so it doesnt really make sense, he cant rent out the room anyway unless my sis moves out too.Why I'm not working pt now, is cos this sem is really proj heavy and I'm doing my fyp from last holiday until now (struggling in my final yr), I have been juggling pt work til covid started and my pt job didnt renew my contract. It's not like I'm lazy and not working at all, and I have some health issues too so decided to rest abit before starting full time after grad too. And I didnt get allowance at all from either of my parents, for school fees or anything, since sec sch, so it kind of hurts to see ppl say I took alot of money and not paying back. I'm grad next yr, waiting for 1 yr + before I move out (hence the 2 yrs), cos I unds that my father can rent out the room, but since my sis also in same room I'm not sure whther he will rent out or let my sis stay.Ofc I will give him allowance after I start work, maybe just help to pay bills instead of giving him money directly, since he will just buy joss sticks or toto. But it's just that I want to save for my future too, it's kind of annoying when he is self-employed and sometimes just lazy to work and complain about no money, still keep eating out and buy perfume and useless stuff, hence I'm not very willing to help pay now. But if he needs or falls ill I can still chip in, just not giving money straight if you unds.Thanks.-#102398: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102398",8 ,2 ,0,17,0,9,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
#102396,2022-03-12,"In need of genuine advice from NUSWhispers community. Really hope admin will post this..Im a 29F, been tog w my current bf for close to a yr Things were largely ok. We hv e occasional disagreements like most couples do but nothing big. Recently we went on  a staycay, things were great, until my bf started texting furiously. I came to realise he was chatting on IG – nothing wrong really. Until he started tilting his phone away from me to prevent me from seeing what he was doing on his phone. I’m not the kind of person who would peer over someone’s screen while they are on their phones, and have never ever done it once towards my bf, so I found his behavior very peculiar. Throughout the entire staycay, his actions were repeatedly odd. While we were out talking a walk, he’d make sure he was a few steps behind me while texting furiously. In the room, if we were seated side by side, he’d again tilt his phone screen away from me. The brief moments he stepped out of the room for a few secs, when he came back in and realized his phone was within reach of me, he’d quickly pocket it. The ultimate move was when he brought his phone into the toilet and he was texting while brushing his teeth, I so happened to walk in and he turned his entire body away from me to make sure I cldnt see what was happening on his phone screen.I am not sure what to make out of this, and I have to say my trust in him plummeted to rock bottom that night. It’s been a few weeks now and as much as I try, I cannot get his behaviour out of my head. So to the guys out there reading this, can any of you please explain to me what this might mean? Im not sure what I should do as well, for I know he might get defensive even if I gently bring it up..-#102396: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102396",38 ,4 ,0,6,0,14,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

#102388,2022-03-12,"I felt like I have so much suppressed feelings on the inside such that I can explode at anytime...Some background information: I am an only child and also a a final year student at NUS. Since 2020, my mum have panic disorder and her symptoms are leading towards hypochondriasis (illness anxiety). Throwback were the days where I accompanied my mum to AED since she said she felt heaviness in her chest and heart pounding very fast and only to get some pills for relaxing purposes.  Since then, my mum wasn't a fan of doctors since she expected the doctors to cure her instead of giving some relaxing purposes. When my mum have panic disorder, other than having chest tightness and fast pounding of heart, she would fall into the rabbit hole of blaming herself and cry easily. Hypochondriasis often occurs when she has to take medicine for her gastric pain. For every medicine she eats, she would go online to search for their side effects and worry excessively about it. My mum also tried to commit suicide and this memory has been a heartbreaking and painful one for both my dad and me. My dad and I are the only ones who calmed my mum down and I felt very tired. I found myself absorbing this negative energy and there were times where I secretly cried at night to get rid of this energy. The next day, I put on a smiley face and go to study or work as if nothing happened. Gradually I miss out on friends' gatherings; I often used excuses for not going out. To me, during gatherings were meant for talking about happy stuff and not sad stuff. All these while, like my peers, I yearn the company of a boyfriend who is willing to lend a listening ear or support me mentally during tough times. I also crave the feeling of pouring one's heart wholeheartedly into a significant other. But wait...how am supposed to do that when I am half broken inside?  People said university is the best place to find a significant other but sadly I am unable to have met one or really meet new people. All I did was to study, work part-time, eat, sleep and repeat. I voiced out to my dad for us to bring my mum to see a psychologist but he quickly dismissed it. We kept my mum's condition a secret from my maternal and paternal families in order to not let them (esp grandparents) worry. There were times my family members suspected that my mum has health problems but we did not really say further.My dad quit his 2-to-3k paying job to look after my mum full-time at home. Since then my mum became happier and worried less often. It has been nearly a year since they stopped working, leaving me the only breadwinner in the family. It was hard to get financial help/apply for covid grant, especially when my dad quit on his own accord and mum does not have a official medical letter for her situation. I have been working as a freelance promoter and also working every summer holidays since Year 1. Unlike many of my peers, they get to play, watch drama or only when they like it during holidays. Deep down in my heart, I would love it to rest too, but I felt like my situation does not allow me to do so. I felt like it is always better to have some savings for rainy days, contribute to family income and I have to pay for my own school fees. Despite the tough situation, I am always thankful for being born to a loving and warm family. My parents actually never pressurized me to give them money and insisted that they still got some savings to cope for now.Because of my accumulative working experiences gained through the years, I considered my CV to be far ahead compared to my peers. There are times where the interviewers are very impressed with my CV on how I manage work and studies when I applied for jobs. When they asked what inspired you to work alot, I always mention the surface-level answer, which is to gain exposure to the real working experience, help develop my skill towards XXX direction. I learned that I could not show my weakness to the recruiters by saying my family situation for people may use that against you in my opinion. What they did not know are the struggles and difficulties behind the scene, a person who has many mental breakdowns in between but for the sake of myself and family, I picked myself up and carried on with life. A person who practises smiling in front of the mirror and tells herself that each day is a brand new day to start. A person who believes in miracles and knows that she is the master of her own destiny. A person who knows that she is now an adult and have to bear responsivities herself whether she get married or not in the future. Thinking back, I am thankful for all of these events that happened to me as they helped to build my resilience level.The next step I am looking forward to is to get a full-time good paying job in my desired field upon graduation in mid-2022. I hope within a year, I could be more financially stable so that I would not be too concerned about money issues. I want to bring my family on overseas trips, take them to eat good food and buy things that we can always look from outside the shops. I secretly want to have a boyfriend who treats me and my family well too; someone who is caring, treats his family well and has similar outlooks in life.Thank you for reading up to there.

#102387,2022-03-12,"TLDR: My boyfriend's ex asked him to work with her.They broke up 6-7 years ago, ended within a year and it was his first relationship. A passionate flame would be the best description. They occasionally kept in contact as they are in the same line of work, but it never bothered me as she was in a long-term relationship. Likewise, my boyfriend and I have a pretty healthy social system of knowing friends of each other. I've met all his close friends, vice versa, and he's welcome to questions in general so being insecure was never a concern even though he has several female friends, which I like hanging out with too!So when his ex reached out on whether he's interested to work with her, my initial reaction was to go for it as the company is quite renown, and an opportunity like this is hard to come by. Despite him being hesitant at first due to the scope of work, he is considering to accept it.Now since it was an Instagram DM, I scrolled through her page as she's one of his few friends I didn't follow since we haven't met irl, for obvious reasons. Turns out, she broke up with her boyfriend a month ago. Upon further probe on my bf when I asked why there's no couple posts up anymore. Now the question is, should I be worried? On one hand, our relationship is rock solid, BTO-ed all, and it's a good job offer. On the other hand, they will be working in the same team and seeing each other for at least 5 days a week. I trust him without a doubt now, but is it natural to worry about what could happen in the future. Am I being unnecessarily paranoid? FYI it took him quite some time to get over their rs as she's the one who brought up the break. We laughed about it when he told me the story of how he cried while eating dinner on the night they broke up, which I find quite cute la, but the reality is now. Never thought they'll actually meet cause they've never in our 5 year+ relationship.-#102387: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102387",25 ,7 ,0,4,0,32,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

#102381,2022-03-10,"Just a rant...I'm in a design-based group project and today I had an argument with one of the tutors...The situation is that one group member was from design background, and he has been dominating the whole project, without listening to the ideas of the rest of us. We can only do some supportive job like finding proofs and images, while he's the one in charge of drawing and we all have to adjust our parts according to him. So basically we are just not allowed to express our own ideas. Gradually we don't really want to express our ideas because they will be always rejected by the so-called 'leader', and the project will always go in the way he likes.So today during the consultation with one tutor, after he finished his comments, the tutor scolded us like, 'not able to think', 'no contribution to the project' 'what have the girls done'and so on, and the tutor kept saying that for more than 20 mins. He was also being super harsh and saying like, 'I kept looking at this programme with a blind eye and lower my standard to your level'. I became so irritated that, he's not in our situation, and it's not fair for him to judge us like that. He might be a good professional in his field but not in teaching. My friend was crying because of all the rude accusations. So I couldn't help to speak up for ourselves. Although I was super upset, I was trying to be calm and polite, when expressing that in our situation behind the scene, there are conflicts that cannot be resolved and it's not fair to treat us like that, and we need to be respected. Then the tutor became much ruder, saying like 'ok you said you made effort then show me thru your work next week lor, what do you want from me?' While the 'leader' said nothing useful but being a selfish jerk that he's been working hard. I didn't say anything about the tutor's teaching, just asked for respect, and told him we are going to solve our issue after this entire drama. ...... but the tutor kept misunderstanding my words so I told myself that I better be quiet and nvr speak anymore.After we've been lectured for 40 mins, the tutor seemed calmed down and saying like 'it's good to express your frustration, it's also a good chance for me to say my frustration also.' And he smiled and kept calling my name asking if I still have more to confess. I don't want the whole group to be downgraded, so I said something like 'maybe I'm not from the profession, and this has been a ""me"" problem'. As he looked like relaxed and saying 'it's glad to hear your frustration blablabla, maybe we can schedule another session, and I can explain to you what will be a good comprehensive outcome of such a project.' I really hope our group won't be downgraded due to this drama. I don't mind me being downgraded but not the whole group, because I will definitely not go into the design-wise industry. Plus there are 2 more tutors grading us as well. My only concern now is hoping he has teaching ethics and please don't downgrade my friend and the group.........-#102381: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102381",9 ,1 ,0,0,0,6,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

#102371,2022-03-10,"What should I do with my 1 plus year relationship with my bf? We argue almost every week.Recently, he got angry with me, saying that I never listen to him whenever he gave advice. One incident that he brought up during the argument was insurance, about how I chose to listen to my insurance agent rather than him. Even after when I explained to my bf that I trusted the insurance agent and went ahead purchasing the plan because the agent had sufficiently answered all my questions that I bombarded him with, my bf still got angry that I chose to trust a stranger over him ( he was against me purchasing the plan). Recently, I was scammed of a few hundred bucks because of a stupid mistake that I made, but instead of showing me empathy (which he said he wont give), he scolded me for being naive and trusting and this incident was lumped together with the insurance incident and the argument was centered around how i dont listen to him and refuse to submit to his leadership, and how if we were to have a family, he won't be able to trust me with finances.  The argument became so heated with f*** words in almost every message from him, even after I tried to appease him by acknowledging my stupid mistake with the scam incident and that I would try to listen to his future advice if it is within reason.  There was once when my bf accompanied me to repair my phone screen, and he advised me to backup my phone in case my data gets deleted during the repair. I heeded his advice and backup whatsapp and 2 of my most important apps. However, at the repair store, when the repair guy said that my phone will take 2 days to repair and all my data will be gone because he will factory reset my phone, I panicked and asked if I could rethink about repairing my phone. My bf got pissed and just asked the guy to go ahead with the repair. The repair guy was nice enough to lend me a loaner phone and backup my data to the loaner phone (which took about 2 hrs to backup). In a text message later that night, my bf said he was angry that I wasted 2 hrs of his time waiting for the loaner phone to back up my data just because i didnt backup my phone like he told me to. He said that he felt that I refused his leadership at the repair store when I said I wanted to rethink the repair. ( Quick question to the ladies: how do u submit to your partner? What does that mean? Totally listen to him without thinking for yourself?)Lately, with all our arguments, I don't seem to feel the love in our relationship anymore. I'm conflicted because I can't imagine my life without him, but I also can't help but feel that we will not be happy in the long run. The way he gets angry with me really scares and intimidates me. During our arguments,  even after I apologise for whatever mistake he said I made, he will say my apologies aren't magic, and his anger won't disappear just because I apologised. I feel very drained by all those arguments. What should I do? Those arguments seemed petty even as I was typing it, but somehow, they could become full-fledged arguments that last over a few days.Thank you so much for taking the time to read this long post .

He keeps insisting that we have the money from our prev jobs to cover the bills, but we are actually saving for the future, I'm planning to get married next yr and my sister and I are not working atm to focus on studies (proj been pretty heavy this sem), so we will be using our savings. And I'm also not willing to pay for electricity since he is the one who uses the ac every night, it's very unfair.

First and foremost I've taken responsibility and know I'm in the wrong. But yea feel free to tell me that I am again. Late 20s, married (unhappily) with a daughter. Wasn't smooth sailing like every other r/s but so many times before we had a daughter, we wanted to call it off but fearing the repercussions of 'how is this going to make both our parents feel' made us decided to try again. Yeah it was a mistake and we should have just parted ways. Comes the daughter and both of us love her very much. But we just don't see eye to eye on alot of things. Being in this r/s for me is eating me up inside and to make it worse, I'm not one to have anyone to talk to other than the counsellor that I'm seeing. Thinking that the problem lies with me. Never wanted to disappoint my parents but probably already am at this stage. To make matters worse, I've just lost someone who means the world to me. My other half never liked the idea of me having friends and I thought it was fine but no it's not. So my secret of having this someone got exposed and there everyone goes. I've lost everyone and everything and here I am pretending everything is going to be fine. For once when something was going right and I felt happy with life to have given me this blessing of a person... it ended just like that. I'm just someone sociable who craves love and have plenty to give sincerely but being stuck in this rabbit hole is just torturing. I'll probably die alone given that my worth isn't what it is anymore. Not sure if anyone can even relate to this. I'd do anything to feel happy again and do things right.I'm in no position to say this but follow your heart peeps. If your gut tells you it doesn't feel right, end it there and then nicely. Don't pursue life base on conformity and just because you're afraid of the consequences... cause trust me it gets worse later on.

I've worked in the valley with the rainforest company for about 4 years before returning back to SG and all I've got to say is this.Fundamentals matter, but not where you've learned them from. Who cares if you don't get it during school, if you can learn it at work even better. They pay you to learn whereas you have to pay a school to learn. As long as you are able to prove that you know what you are doing, it is fine.I've met MANY senior engineers who have never studied CS formally and that is proof enough that you don't necessarily need a CS education to be a good engineer.I think it is quite ridiculous there are so many in the comment section who write off people just because of their unconventional learning path.The fact that OP with his mediocre grades is out earning individuals who study really hard and then get a job in SG is a good lesson for everyone.-#102363: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102363",2 ,2 ,0,0,0,15,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
#102359,2022-03-10,"Hi car owners. I need urgent advice. ????????I will be purchasing a second hand car from a direct owner. Transaction will be done through a company that owns a car workshop.The 30% down payment that I’ve to put down is $20+k.The owner of the car workshop said that I have to transfer the money to them on Friday and in turn they will transfer to the seller to settle his outstanding loan with a in-house finance company.Hence it means that the car ownership cannot be transferred to me immediately after I pay the $20+k.The big problem here is that I was cheated of almost $30k by a used car dealer a few years ago! They took my money, let me drive off the car but didn’t transfer the ownership to me! That was really a nightmare and I almost committed suicide because I was cheated of all my savings!I cannot afford for the same thing to happen this time round.I told the owner that I will only transfer the money to them once ownership is transferred but it’s not possible because he said that the seller needs my money to do settlement with the in-house finance company.What can I do in order not to be cheated again?(PS: Pls kindly do not bash me with harsh words as I genuinely need urgent advices.

#102357,2022-03-10,"To #102294I am in a similar situation as you because of a cheating dad I couldn’t trust any guy. And there was this guy interested in me but instinctively I pushed him away, such as ignoring him and acting like he did not exist. till now I couldn’t understand why I did what I did because I really really do like him. Similarly, I tried to move on. It was hard. Especially when just leave things as they are and not do anything. My feelings for him lasted close to eight years. But yes they do eventually fade. But it is painful and tortuous. And maybe my feelings for him faded  because he got engaged.I really hope that you can let him know your feelings because it’s too late. Even if he seems to have lost interest. This is for your own benefit. At least you know for sure whether he is still into you or he has moved on. He is super unlikely to make a move again since u have kind of rejected him. (I have been rejected by another guy before and it is impossible for me to put myself in a position for another rejection) Lastly, to all the commenters who simply cannot empathize with the impact of a cheating father on their daughter. Lucky you. You don’t have to experience this traumatic experience in this life time. A cheating father’s impact is strong and long lasting. Even if you think the mother should be the saddest and it is none of the children’s business. But no the children are affected. Think about psychology. Your parental figures are screwed up how can you grow up normally and have normal relationships? It is really something that is very hard to change. And I do not think that op is silly because it is an innate reaction that she has little control over.-#102357: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102357",6 ,1 ,0,0,4,11,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
#102361,2022-03-10,"Today marks the 4th month since i broke up with my toxic ex and i am still dealing with the aftermath of the emotional damage he left me with. He tore down my self-esteem and i felt so ugly about myself. The best thing that happened post breakup was that i finally plucked up the courage to attend therapy sessions.As a girl who has been dealing with pcos for years, i have never been fit nor toned no matter how much effort i put into working out during my off days. My ex is very into fit girls and he follows a ton of fitness influencers/local girls on his instagram and likes + saves their pictures. I have communicated to him that i do not feel comfortable about it but eventually when nothing was done on his part, i tried my best to not feel bothered by it. A year into the relationship, covid hit and i got really busy at work (i am in the healthcare industry). I had even lesser time to workout and i put on a few kgs. That was when my ex started comparing me with certain local fitness influencers, saying that if i put in more effort into exercising i can look hot like them and become more attractive to him. He even requested me to dress like them. Of course i felt really hurt by those comments because he should have been aware of my medical condition and my commitment at my workplace. Furthermore those influencers do not have a fixed work schedule which gives them more freedom and some of them are even fitness instructors which means they are working out while at work! My self-esteem started spiralling down and this continued on for more than a year. On hindsight i really should have left this loser earlier.The last straw came when i found out through a friend that he signed up at the gym his favourite influencer was working out at. The thing is, it was not even near his place and i would not have known if my friend did not tell me when she happened to see him there. I confronted him and he said that he does not see any issue with that because he did not cheat. By intentionally approaching someone you are attracted to, is that not emotional cheating already? So i asked him whether he would be happy if i became like those girls, dressing skimpily and uploading photos and videos in provocative angles and poses to attract likes, would he be ok with his gf behaving like that online? Why does he worship all these girls solely for their appearances, to the extent of bringing his own girlfriend down? What if they had yucky personalities? He just kept quiet. It was too much for me to handle at that point of time and we broke things off. He started insulting me and told our mutual friends that i was just being a salty and insecure b1tch. I lost some friends because of that.So guys, if you want to simp over influencers online, kindly do the entire female population a favour and do not get into a relationship. Never claim to love your girlfriend when all you do is attack her confidence by comparing her with others and making her feel inadequate about herself. The damage is really hard to get over and i wish that no girl would experience what i have been through...P.S my ex is not a buff guy himself-#102361: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102361",19 ,8 ,0,28,0,46,0,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#102356,2022-03-10,"My hubby is almost 40 years old yet he speaks with his mother on the phone everyday. It’s either his mum calls him or he calls his mum. I can’t stand such a mummy’s boy & honestly it’s a my dealbreaker for me if I’d known about his habit when we were dating. I visit my in-laws once to two times a week. It’s not like they can’t update each other then. Rmb it’s not emergency stuff that they’re updating each other everyday. She also doesn’t have major health issues. She is very reliant on him on everything. She & her husband are moving to an estate close to us soon & I’m worried my hubby will run every small errand his parents esp. his mother asks of him simply because he chats with her everyday. His mother asks him to do errands even when they live far apart, not to mention when they move near to us. Guys, do you call your mum everyday to update her about your day. I’m a girl and I don’t even do that! It’s creepy. I’ve sounded this out to him by saying, ‘How come your mum calls you everyday?’ But he thinks nothing of it & doesn’t get the hint that I’m disgusted by it. How can I make it clearer to him that he & his mum’s call routine is creepy? He may just hide, call & whisper in the toilet if I make it any more obvious. Sorry, their kind of co-dependency sh*t & intimacy just borders on incest even though it’s not.

#102355,2022-03-10,"To #102320Run. I was in the same situation, my parents felt that my then bf (ex) was not on par with me in many aspects like intellect or career, weak and expressly stated that he was a mummy boy, they told me not to continue but they will still respect my decision at the end because i have a strong personality. My mom was especially concerned that his mom will be a big problem.They also never interfered in the relationship as my family firmly believes that adults should resolve things themselves within the relationship. I decided to continue because i saw that he treated me very well and he said he wanted to grow and be better etc, but over time, fights were starting to show that some façade of his personality wasn't what i thought it was. I confidently told my parents that his mum wouldn't do anything bad to me since she seemed sweet and he was such a sweet guy so he wouldn't let her anyway. Oh man, i was SOOOO WRONG. His mom made all sorts of guilt trip comments when we got a BTO and started trying to propose/insist we all stay tgt.  She even confronted me because he was telling her the details of our fights (obviously one-sided and with omitted facts) and not once did she ask me for my side of the story. And that was after i silently tolerated her snide comments chiding me, 3 times. That was the final straw. These are just examples of how extreme some mommy boys can be and you should look out for it. In the end, we broke up for the EXACT reasons (and many more) my parents told me he wasn't suitable for me, but it took out the critical years of my life. We broke up because, like they said, he will always listen to mummy (He told me nothing wrong with him running to his parents with our problems and their interference), the constant interference from his mom and finally, all those things he said about growing? It never materialised.We always tend to ignore our parents, but sometimes they see the things that we cannot see. So while you have to make your own call, take time to really observe if your parents make valid pts. Oh and also, see how his mom reacts to his mistakes/tempers, if she brushes it aside or covers it up or pander to him, run girl RUN!-#102355: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102355",11 ,7 ,0,0,0,94,7,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#102352,2022-03-10,"Am I a bad child for not taking care of my parents? Since young, I've never had any affection for my parents. I find it weird that when my dad was working, he can spend his salary on gambling and other extra activities. As a result, I never had a nice childhood. Went to school, they told me I need to get specs as I was short sighted, my parents insist that I was fine. Even the dentist told me to get braces for my crooked teeth, they still insist it was fine. Even I was pulled out from swimming classes because he had to sign the waiver of responsibility from the consent form.My whole childhood is practically a nightmare. I can play with toys, only because my relatives gave them to me. My parents don't buy for me anything because my aunties are nice enough to buy for me. I want to read books, but my parents told me they can't afford it. But they can enjoy their lives. Even when I have fantastic results for PSLE, they told me to go to a good secondary as my sister, going to the likes of RI can be expensive. Even when I wanna go to poly after that, they insist on me to go to JC because uniform is cheaper. Don't get me started on my own clothes, I practically grew up on just a rotation of few clothings. And my underwear will only be replaced once it's badly worn and tattered. So, every year, I get a few bursaries, either from the Union, govt and such. Guess what? My father will take them all, and insist that he's paid for my upbringing. Don't get me started on upbringing. I eat shit food since young. Now that I'm older, I practically grew up on the cheapest food available. I eat white bread on its own without any spread. My mum cook, but never beef or fish, just scraps of chicken, either made into a soup or fried to be eaten with sweet soy sauce. It totally make sense now why I totally enjoy eating normal food. Eating laksa or mee siam is soooo enjoyable for me now even though it may seems nothing to you guys.As for discipline, I realised I probably had ADHD or something. I had trouble listening to instruction and I was super hyper active. On hindsight, it was probably because I was mostly cooped up at home. As a kid, I usually go out with my relatives more than my family. My relatives didn't have any trouble disciplining me though. But at home, I was more of a punching bag. I knew when was their salary date. Because closer to the date, my dad will always be angry and fight with my mom, and somehow, I will trigger either of them, either my dad will whack me with things, or my mum will slap me to appease him. Thinking back, I felt like I was an offering for either of them to ease their anger. If there's free balloon outside, I will only take the string ones cos it will hurt less later. That hard metal pole to hang clothes, yeah.. It bended, I was stronger than that soft metal. I was surprised that I made it till an adult without any serious injury. Even called the police once, they did nothing to help me. After JC, my dad told me to work. nahh.. I went back to study. Somehow in anger or something, he sold the house to take most of his money. What a pathetic loser. I was actually homeless, even the school didn't believe me that I was homeless. Since then, I got married and was out of his life. Eventually, my mother divorced and remarried. I hate her less than my dad but I still blame her for being an enabler to his actions. How dare she let those 20 years of mine be in suffering? Probably as a result of that, my next 20 years are kinda stunted. While others are making families and moving up in their career, I was just happy being free, enjoying the simple things in life. Sure, I got a decent job now, but I wasn't doing as well as my peers. Most of them are high flyers, I sometimes compare to them and wonder if the difference between us are probably supporting parents. For my dad, I didn't keep track of him if he's alive or not. He could be dead for all I care. That's how deep my anger is still now. People may say, it's okay, let go and forgive and forget. He's your parent afterall. I prayed to God for help as a kid. Heck, I even prayed to Satan for help. Both didn't even help me at all. That's probably why I'm not so religious. Most of my friends told me, I shouldn't do that, and I should take care of them now that they are old. For me, if given a choice, I rather not to be born at all. Probably the same reason why I do not want to have kids. Am I wrong not to take care of them? To those who might be in similar situation as me, how do you cope? Sure I did contemplated suicide before, but the only reason I keep living is to enjoy food, music and such. There are still so many things more I want to experience before I throw in the towel.

We have not been the best at communicating throughout the whole relationship. At the 2nd year of our relationship, I fell into a depressive spiral (not medically diagnosed but was in a bad mental place) and he was there for me throughout which I was very grateful for. However, throughout this whole ordeal, he was just unable to understand what I was going through and I felt that he just did not believe that I was really depressed. Till today, I feel that it has snowballed into a fundamental issue in our relationship and it is almost near impossible for us to communicate with each other on our feelings. It is almost as if a fish trying to talk to a duck. Barely anything gets through to the other party and we often try to make amends but the same problem of miscommunication often comes up. It seems impossible for us to understand where each other is coming from.Every time this happens, I feel so cornered and along because it seems like even the dearest person to me can’t understand me. At bad times, I turn to self-harm and often fantasise escaping from the situation by ending my life (which I know is stupid and my parents will be so sad so I don’t).We have already committed to a BTO together and so there are huge stakes between us and I want to make things work.

#102350,2022-03-10,"This is in response to #102306. I wonder if op will be able to do well for the subjects op/prof ben mentioned in the post, after all that focused leetcoding and projects that he worked on.I think some students need more time to familiarise, because this is the first time they are touching code. Yes, some get it faster than others (and not to say those who already code before y1), but that does not immediately mean the slower ones are not going to be good engineers.  And by slow, I am referring to folks who need 1 or even 2 years to really develop the instinct and get used to the environment to code effectively. Unfortunately, by then the grades in their first and second year would have shown that they are ""not suitable"" for CS, which could lead to missed opportunities/ modules. I feel like maybe op is of such ilk, especially since op can leetcode and build projects later on.So the question is how does the school deal with late bloomers? Does the school track how students who didnt do well early on, but went on to a swe career(faang, startup, and what not)? Are these people significant in numbers? I understand that grades is the best tool (so far) to organize students by scale, and we certainly don't want to coddle undergrads. But perhaps the insistence that the grades for CS1101S/ C2040S/ CS3230 , AT Y1 AND Y2 being an indicator for success is not that accurate. Harping on it all the time, and saying it is an axiom doesnt help, nor account for the different experience of other people. At a time where schools are talking about late blooming, learn at your own pace, or degrees with 5 year expiry, wouldnt soc consider the fact that it's identification of ""good engineer"" at subjects taken at Y1 and Y2 seem very limited? Perhaps, their understanding of ""coding"" needs to come from other avenue first, like working on a project, before eventually having the theories stick to them?Or maybe soc is doing more than they already can, before students are left to their own devices. Anyways, I hope more students hang in there, especially if you have interest, and have a sense that you can program.

Been through 4 medium to long term (> 2 years) relationships. I'm married close to 20 years now. I want to say this to those who are still seeking love. If you have problems/issues that cannot be resolved or compromised while you are still bf/gf, the same problems will only get worse after marriage. When you are looking for certain qualities in a person, did you self reflect and see if you have anything to offer? Do you want to grow to become a better version of yourself? Do you have the potential to bring out the best in your partner? Do you want the best for your partner?I recently had a reunion meet up with old friends and found out through them that 2 of my exes are still single after 20 years. The 3rd one divorced after being married for less than 5 years. I married my 4th bf. All 3 relationships I left because I cannot imagine a future with the guy and there were issues that cannot be resolved. They did not possess qualities of being a reliable partner then. I don't know why they are still single now but I'm glad I moved on else I wouldn't have met my husband. When I met my husband, he made me want to become a better version of me. It was not hard to love him at all. Like any couples, we have conflicts and disagreements but there was 1 distinct difference about him, he is a listener, he is patient and he can compromise when my request is reasonable. Because of that I start to behave more like him. I start to be more patient too. When I almost slipped back into my old princess ways he will lovingly talk to me and make me want to be a better person not just for him but also for myself. With a blink of an eye, we have spent 20 blissful years together. He became an even better man, better than I imagined, after we have children. A relationship should not be turning your life upside down and making you question your worth in life. A relationship should be a fulfilling one that makes you the best version of yourself. If you and your partner do not have this same goal in mind, being together will be hard. To those still looking for love, I hope you find that someone. If you want to meet a patient man, be a patient woman. If you want to meet a kind woman, be kind first. If you date around with a certain kind of mentality, you are likely going to attract that and your thoughts will lead you to justify that negativity. Consider a setback a lesson that will make you a better person for the partner you have yet to met.

#102342,2022-03-08,"Saw the responses to #102306 and as a true blue Singaporean laojiao SWE who has been in the states for >10 years and having interviewed many job applicants (from top colleges, private degrees, bootcamps, no college etc)...here's my 2 sen comment...I think it is very important to note that if OP managed to leetcode their way into the states, then OP probably has at least average coding skills and OP's code is probably not that shit...I don't think if you are that bad you can 1) convince someone to sponsor your work visa as a fresh graduate and 2) pay you 145K USD a year which is still a non trivial amount of money despite the insane salaries in the valley.I think most of you failed to notice this before you cast your stones at OP.I just want to say maybe its the mindset difference between Asia and the West, but I have never really considered anyone's GPA after they passed the OA. I usually present snippets of code and ask the candidate to debug it, or complete the function, or write a unit test for it. I find that this a lot more useful in evaluating engineering ability than asking them to code out some pointless DP algorithm.I only really care about whether they can do the job they applied for and it seems to me that the OP of #102306 has a lot more work experience than the average CS grad according to this part ""During my time at NUS I was lucky enough to find a part time internship and worked there throughout my time at NUS.""Supposing that OP worked as a junior, by that metric I would put this candidate above any fresh graduate who doesn't have equivalent work experience. Even better if OP has projects/open source to show for.Obviously OP would probably never be able to get into HFT or be a quant, but I'd argue OP's grades don't really matter past OP's first full time gig if OP applies to MANGA or similar. I know of many individuals who have made it into MANGA in spite of their bad grades as a fresh graduate. The unifying quality they all had was that they never gave up and didn't let their poor college experience hold them back.Also, a TC of 145K USD as a fresh grad is quite commendable when in most states (not California or New York) the going average is maybe about 90-120K for an average CS fresh grad. (except SV or New York, but how am I not surprised many of you think this way. Most Singaporeans I know or have met in the states tend to pigeonhole themselves to only these 2 places and not consider the rest of the country which is like literally the size of Europe). You can check Blind and verify that to be very true. Not every firm is MANGA or a billion dollar unicorn lol.To the OP of #102306, just work hard at your job, ask for help when you need help and learn as much as possible on the job. Complete your tickets on time (which I am sure you will if you follow the previous point) and most importantly, be a team player.Most people are nice people and don't mind lending a helping hand to someone who shows he is putting in effort. Software Engineering IS a ""profession of skill"".

But since agreeing on exclusivity he has been really cold. E.g. no starting conversation, taking a couple of days to reply on text, in fact we text about once a week, and go out way less than when we were casually dating. Claiming that he has been really busy with exams and school work. The last time we met, I told him if he continues to be so, we should just go back to a non-committal relationship.

(this was more than 2 weeks ago around valentines period, and we haven't talk much since)Background: Yes, I like him and I was the one who asked to be in an exclusive stage as he try and figure out his feelings. This is so that I would get the security that he won't be meeting other people as well, vice versa. Previously, we could text on a daily/ alternate day.Should I continue waiting for this guy?

My mom doesn’t work and my dad is still working although he can retire. He doesn’t want to as he said he gets bored.What I can’t stand about my parents is… they just don’t want to pay for things they want to buy. They have money, but they want us to pay for them. We already give them about $2.5k of allowance every month in total.On top of that, if they want anything.. for example, renovate their home (for no practical reason, more of aesthetics) they want us to pay for it. We have paid for what they want a few times (renovate kitchen, renovate toilet)… but now it becomes a habit. Everytime they want something, they want us to pay for it. They wanted to install new ceiling fans recently and also asked us to pay for it. My mom recently found out that i hired a part time helper for my home, then she started hinting to me that she also wants a part time helper for her home and she wants me to pay for it. With the VTL opening, they mentioned they want to go to europe holiday (est 10k per person) and they also asked us if we can pay for it. It’s not like my parents cannot afford these things that they want, they CAN afford it.. But they want us to pay for it. I don’t understand why? My dad even said to me, “to you all $500 is nothing since your salary so high. To me $500 is a lot.” But wtf, i am only earning slightly higher than my dad (10% more).. and although we are comfortable, all of us have kids and we still have to save up for our own kids. Plus, even though my older siblings earn double than me, it is unfair for them to keep paying for whatever my parents want just because they want it. Talking to them is difficult, they will probably just say that we are being stingy with our money and don’t want to spend on them. Sigh.

Today my bf (together for 2 yrs) went for dinner with his female friend one on one. They tend to meet only 2-4 times a yr, not too often. I wasn’t invited and didn’t ask to join either as I didnt know her. He mentioned they were meeting at the dinner place, then he would offer her a ride home after the meal which was fine with me. Bf and i were out together before he headed off for dinner. While i was using his phone to transfer some photos to mine, his female friend texted saying she will be late and he should come over to pick her up slightly later. This sets off an alarm in my mind as he didn’t mention anything about fetching her from her home. I didnt want to snoop into his messages but that notification was lingering at the back of my mind. As he was in the toilet when this happened, i didn’t immediately bring this up but i did try to ask if he was headed off to the dinner place directly after dropping me home and he said yes. I’m kinda shocked about this but i dont want to jump to conclusions so quickly.Firstly, it normal for guy friends to fetch their female friend when meeting for meals regardless its convenient or not? And secondly, is it normal to send them back after dinner? Lastly, is my bf behaviour normal in this case and should i be feeling wary or am i overly paranoid?

For that i am thankful.However, i also remember incidents when i was a kid.. where my dad occasionally got physical with me (e.g: slapping me when he had a bad day at work or when I accidentally spilled water etc).When i got older, he did slap me a few times when he was angry at me but I remember he was mainly very harsh with his words (e.g: calling me a slut that no man wants to marry in front of my ex-bf because i didn’t dress covered up enough). I wore clothes with sleeves and long pants usually. The cause of our fights when i was older was mainly my outfits.These fights always result in me crying and breaking down, or running away from home for a few hours.

I don’t dare to bring those incidents up though they are clear in my mind, even if more than 15 years has passed for some incidents.I don’t think he has the intention to abuse me emotionally or physically but of course it felt like abuse.Anyway, now that I’m married and expecting my first kid, i kept having dreams of my dad scolding me, slapping me, being angry at me and i always wake up crying.

The two of us are the only girls in the group, and she joined the friend group because she's the girlfriend of one of the other guys. The problem is.. she is very very quiet. I've known her for about 2 years but I never really talked to her until she joined our group. Its not that I dont want to be close to her, I just find it very difficult to talk to her because the conversations keep dying off or she gives really short replies. From my observation, she doesn't have any other friends in school except us, so I try my best to make her feel at home around us but at the same time I feel scared of her because I don't know what shes thinking.Every few weeks we will have some nights where we go online and play some party games while on zoom. The whole time she will be muted and only unmute when someone mentions her name. But she gives off the vibe that she doesn't enjoy the games... For example we played Among Us once, and when we suspected her of being the imposter we asked her to defend herself and all she did was unmute herself and say ""idk"". Then we feel bad for voting her out. She never tells us if she is enjoying herself or not, and her boyfriend isn't telling us anything negative so we just assume she's having fun. A few months ago when we were all allowed to go out as a group, we went to USS (it was her idea, I was quite glad because that meant she enjoyed our company). But every time when we were queuing for rides, she always hung out at the back of the group with her boyfriend and said nothing to the rest of us. We tried to include her in our conversations but it clearly didn't last long and she will just slowly drift to the back.I've talked to one of the guys in this group if he felt that she was a bit left out, and he agreed that she is very difficult to talk to. I don't know if I'm overthinking things, but I feel that as the only other girl in the group, I thought she will be more comfortable being around me. She never shares anything with any of us (except her bf probably). I've tried striking conversations with her but it died off quickly. She lives just a few blocks away from me but out of all the times I've seen her in school, we have only went back together once before. I myself am introverted so I understand that she probably finds it difficult to talk to others as well, but I find it very draining just being around her and trying to make sure she feels okay around us. Sometimes it makes me feel that she doesn't like me. I wondered once if it was jealousy because her boyfriend is friendly to me as well, so I did my best to keep a reasonable distance from him, but nothing changed. May I get some advice on how to deal with such a quiet person?

Yesterday, I found out that she had met her ex behind my back during the weekend in hopes of having sex because she says that she is craving intimacy/affection and I can't be physically with her to satisfy her needs. Nothing happened though because she claims she didn't feel the emotional connection with the ex, but she says that she would have gone through with it if the spark was still there. She had also cheated on me before 4 years ago with this same ex during our initial stages of dating because she says that she wasn't convinced if we were a real thing back then.I also found out yesterday that she had slept with another ex 4 years ago, a month after we became official, because again, she wasn't convinced if we were a real thing. We have spoken extensively over the weekend about this and she says that she regrets everything that she has put me through and that she will change and will never cheat on me again. She says that she sees a future with me and that I'm the only one that she wants to be with and marry and have children with. Should I believe that she can change and stay with her?

I am sure that my bf genuinely treats me well and cares about me hence this is something that I did not mind. The only concern of my parents that I think could be a deciding factor is whether my bf's mum will want to control our relationship and whether he is able to manage it. He is very close to his mum, and my parents feel that no matter what he promises now does not matter as problems will still arise later.

I feel guilty going out with my friends, and feel even more guilty when I use social media or play games. He always calls me toxic. He had hit me before, making me bleed several times by punching me in the lip and the solar plexus. He calls me manipulative.

I feel very stressed out but he blocked me and there is no way for me to contact him. I have been very supportive but to him I am just not trustworthy. I feel so tired in the relationship because he likes to play mind games like tell me I am toxic, or say that it is all because of social media and my friends thats why I am behaving the way I am. I want to break up with him but I am afraid as I still love him and care for him. But it's so tiring to be in a relationship where I dont feel like my actions are being reciprocated. I just want to communicate with him but he always refuses. I am tired. He always blames me when he gets angry or fails at anything in life.

He was very pushy and I felt rushed into the relationship. I should have noticed the red flags sooner. He acted rich but was actually a fake. He spent a lot of time building his upper body and neglected his lower body. So he had big arms with chicken thin legs. His vanity and materialism actually bothered me but I tried to overlook that and try to get to know him more because he seemed genuinely nice at times. My mistake.He is 8 years older than me so I assumed I needed time to understand the difference in us. But time has revealed he is just living a lie. He has no money, he is broke and jobless for the entire 6 months that we've been together and he is trying to live off me while clad in Rolex and branded clothes. He tried to get me to loan him money to buy a car so he can send me to work. He tried to isolate me from my friends. He also deleted all my male friends contact numbers. He was picking and sending me to work daily and arguing with me when he sees me talking to a male colleague. I can't even smile or talk at a guy friend or male service staff without angering him. All unknown numbers on my call logs will be checked and dialed back by him, he will argue with me over unknown numbers and over meaningless things. He says it's my fault because I am too pretty. If I listened to him, none of these will happen. It's all my fault. He argues and makes accusations every chance he gets. The few months with him felt like years of torment. Everytime I try to leave him he would make sure we talk till we make up. He would love bomb me with flowers and gifts and make romantic gestures. It reached a point where there is no more positive feelings left and I wanted to leave for good because talking is useless. He even got his mum to tell me what are my faults. He refused to accept me leaving him and accused me of cheating on him again. He said it so many times till I no longer care to defend myself. I just wanted out. When he finally understood I am leaving for good he started to stalk and harass me. He uses several different numbers to call me during different times of the day. Even during middle of the night. He would throw things into my house at random times of the day. Things like gifts exchanged during our dating days. Once he threw a watch through the window and the watch hit my mum's head. I called the police. He went around and told mutual friends that I've cheated on him. Lucky my friends aren't blind or stupid. I've also asked my friends to never talk to me about this person again. I didn't want to make things difficult for my family so I moved out to get away from him. Recently he called my mum and said he found some stuff of mine and wanted to return to me. I told my mum just ignore his lies. If he wanted to let me have my stuff back he would have let me have it the first time I asked.I'm so put off by what happened to me I don't think I ever want to have another relationship again. He doesn't know where I live now but almost everyday I live in fear that he will find out. I also try to make sure I'm not alone when I'm out because I fear bumping into him.

#102307,2022-03-08,"To the guy who uses dating app for sugar dating, I would say just be your trueself and do whatever you like as long as it’s not against the law. Besides it being a basic economic where there’s always a supply when there’s a demand, it also boils down to the fact that it’s simply just unfair to men, though and it’s quite true from an evolutionary perspective. There is just males fighting among themselves for a female, but it’s virtually impossible to have females fighting for males simply because the attractiveness in females is somewhat much more easier to be perceived. To put it in simpler terms, guys can visit geylang with prostitutes that are chubby/unappealing/old, and it’s very likely that sex will still go on, but unfortunately you hardly or never see old-looking/meaty/overweight/average or below average-looking hustlers, and in fact, women who pay for sex won’t even go for men of such qualities.That’s just reality, so honestly I don’t see anything wrong with sugar dating. You know what further strongly supports this point? My features: 1.78m, above average looking, muscular but not overly buff with 8% body fat, senior front desk banker, a bachelor and master degree from a Russell Group university. Friends and their parents find me very friendly, kind, cheerful, fun yet polite, very approachable. Unfortunately, when I went on dating app, I barely received any matches, I would say at most 1 per day on average. My point is physical attractiveness is what we first observe on the app, and it also determines whether we would “like” or “dislike” them, so there you go, and even if I did opt for casual sex, chances were seemingly unlikely too. On the contrary, my female friends and acquaintances get a ton of matches every single day. You may think that they are hot or pretty, but I afraid not, they are just average (to be very honest), some of them are even obese, but all they showed is a bit of cleavage, their curve in skimpy and tight clothes, and there you go, just 2-3 pictures and they successfully compiled a list of thirsty men from hunger game waiting to get laid with them.Being a man is already difficult, but being a man without a handsome face and nice body is even more difficult, for even, you know, casual sex of course. To stand out among the rest for more “likes” from women, guys may even need the following items in their pictures: Rolex, continental car, business class seat, and bear in mind these are just the basics to have, let alone Patek Philippe/Richard Mille, Lamborghini/Ferrari/McLaren.So dude, I neither support nor oppose your idea of sugar dating, but I honestly see nothing wrong with doing that.

I fondly remember an instance when I was questioned why my code was so shit and why I was so lousy in front of everyone by this individual.In summary, my time at NUS CS was horrible. I will never forget how I was ridiculed by this person.But I spammed leetcode 6 months before graduating and did a few projects. During my time at NUS I was lucky enough to find a part time internship and worked there throughout my time at NUS.Every employer I interviewed with only asked me about my work experience and not once did anyone ask me about my degree or for my transcript (apart from Google).Anyone who says CAP is important is out of touch. Anyone who says you actually need to study hard is out of touch as well. You don't even need to do well in any CS module. You just need to be able to do leetcode and know like 50% of the basics. (and also know what stacks are commonly used in the industry and some system design, all of which is like available online and totally not taught in this school)What actually matters is tenacity, resourcefulness and knowing the right people. I swear to god knowing the right individuals allowed me to get to where I am today and it was a hell a lot easier to do than to grind in this school.Well, by the end of this summer, I will be receiving a B.Comp Computer Science degree with no honors awarded by NUS. And a TC that is probably closer to the 99th percentile than the 75th percentile in the GES LOL.PS. leetcode is amazing, it levels the playing field for everyone and allowed someone like me with garbage grades to succeed.

But personally, I detest questions about grades and I think it's best to leave the other party if he or she's comfortable sharing.I was wondering as the world gets more practical, will couples think CAP is a defining factor in a relationship?

#102294,2022-03-08,"[my late night thoughts]3+ years ago, this one guy was interested in me. but silly(?) me decided to ignore him and not show interest, even though I was very much interested in him as well (because I come from a broken family in which my dad cheated, so I didn't believe that he was truly interested in me). a few months later, he started dating another girl (guess he lost interest). i was devastated because I really liked him and he has traits that I look for in a guy. he stopped dating the girl after a few months though. after I found out he was dating another girl, I told myself that I need to move on and convinced myself that I have already moved on. but I think I never did, especially after I found out he wasn't dating the girl anymore.till today, I still have feelings for him, and I find it so difficult to move on because I can't get over the fact that this is a missed opportunity. like if I showed interest in the beginning, maybe we could have been together. it's because of this ""could have"" that makes me not being able to move on, and also because he really is my ideal kinda guy (kind, simple etc)y'all may ask, since I still have feelings for him, why not just tell him? haha I guess I just don't have the courage to do so, after all I'm not exactly sure if he would still be interested in me. but I did try to be more friendly towards him. ever since I found out he has stopped dating the girl (1+ years ago), I did try to chat with him a little more, and also tried to meet him privately. even though he replies me pretty well and is okay with meeting me privately, deep down I just can't feel that he is interested in me anymore. but I keep holding on because I guess I just can't accept the fact that he has lost interest in me. but right now, at this moment, I have decided that I need to, and will move on. it will take some time I guess. but I hope that one day, I won't have feelings for him anymore. I won't feel sad because of him anymore. I won't feel regretful over this missed opportunity anymore. one day, I hope I meet someone whereby things will just feel easy. it won't feel so difficult like now. i won't have to try so hard to try to make things happen. oh and at the beginning I said silly(?) because it's silly but at the same time not really silly? like yes it's silly because I ignored someone who likes me (who I also like very much), but at the same time I guess I can't blame myself for not being to trust in the past. I mean... my dad is a cheater so I guess I just grew up not trusting guys in general. I guess I shouldn't blame myself and forgive myself :') that way I can learn and grow so much more. ok just my late night thoughts thanks for reading!-#102294: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102294",21 ,3 ,0,6,7,14,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Should i wait?I was the first guy she dated in 2 yrs since her previous relationship and things seems to be going well and we are both exclusively dating (aka not seeing anyone else). She mentioned to me to ‘wait for her to go over to me’ (open her heart to me) when the time is right for her and told me she hope to get her emotions sorted out within this month as she’s still fearful of entering a new relationship and doesn’t want to bring any leftover baggage into a new relationship and hurt me. My female friend say’s that’s fked up and she is probably dating other guys at the same time so i should dump her.

#102288,2022-03-05,"This is the true story of my good friend. He is an excellent IT professional. This is a recent sad story of his job. He has been working for this particular company for 3 years. He is a sincere worker. To be precise, 80% of the work is done by 20% of the engineers. He belongs to that 20% category. Even the company has put a notice period of 3 months if he quits his job (usually 1 to 2 months for other employees). He is that good. Suddenly, the company said that it is liquidating the Singapore operation and laying all the employees of the company in a single call without any prior notice. He has more than 40 holidays that he did not take (He did not take the holidays because he is the go-to guy for most of his projects). He is not getting any salary further even he has a 3 month notice period. He is not getting anything for his holidays that he did not take. I do not know about the legal obligations. But the company said since they are liquidating, they do not have to pay notice period salaries or for the vacations that the employees did not take. He will find a better job soon without any doubt. The thing is the moral value of the company and the management. If you are a family man, sudden termination and no salary will put you under great pressure.The moral of the story is to take your vacation all the time, spend time with your family, and you do not have to be over-committed to a job. In the end, management can just throw you into a bin as in this story. (There are many nice companies. But these companies still exist.

Long story short, I (female) have always been the one that hangs on to the relationship each time he feels like calling it quits. He is very nice, but has very fixed ideas and absolute, not believing the world can be grey and believes it is only black or white. He tends to get caught up in work (which he hates), and when he is focused, he rarely communicates. This gets to me and after talking, we have compromised and I promised to be more understanding of his lack of messaging and communication when he is working). He also has a slew of other issues like feels stifled with a timeline of settling down and suspect there is an element of commitment phobia and perhaps also depression as he says his work really drives him mad and he works international hours. He gets triggered when I double text and ask why doesn't he reply. He says he does not like to feel like he has deadlines to meet (from replying text messages to maybe marriage). The qn I Have is - is this normal? Am I being blinded by love and this relationship or can I try to be more understanding and respect his boundaries? Part of me wonders if his failure to commit etc is because he knows that I am here to stay, and he never had to fight so hard for me. And, both of us are in our early 30s...

I remember feeling very down during the ceremony as most of the salesperson earn above $100k that month. I felt like I am the lowest earner there. Fast forward these few years, every month are there 100, 200 plus salesperson making 6 figures a month.  The company even had to expand the away categeory to differentiate people who make $100k, $250k, $500k and even $1m a MONTH. Last year I clocked about $280k a year and I am satisfied. But my team mate earned over $4m. His income tax alone is almost $1m. Whats my $280k as compared to him?Not forgeting my $280k doesnt even give me a name on the producer chart.

My partner and I are currently separated informally. Not in contact, not staying together. We do not have any children or properties together. Do we need get a lawyer to draw up a formal deed of separation? I read that you separation can be informal, meaning that as long as it is a mutual agreement between both parties, with intention for the separation to lead to divorce. But I am just worried that the court wants us to prove the separation after three years and we might have trouble with the process without a formal legal document. As we are currently not in contact, I would rather not break the status quo for now by bringing up something that is not required. Also, does divorce require you to show up in a court?

#102281,2022-03-05,"On the topic of who should pay more. I get it that the OP just wanted to survey the ""market"" and see what's the norm being practiced by most couples. A few of our friends (minority) and myself, our bfs don't mind paying for all the expenses including our personal shopping. It's rare but it's not impossible. However, I would say a fair amount of couples I know will go Dutch on their dates, not down to every single cents or what side dishes have you ordered for yourself but in general it is a common practice to have both parties contributing almost equally for their dates. If you can't accept that your bf doesn't pay for your expenses, talk to him about it but rmb he is not wrong to not compromise. If a common ground where both parties compromised a little can't be reached, then I guess you guys are not meant for each other. You can find one who is willing to pay and he can find one who doesn't mind paying.Side note, it shouldn't always be measured by how much money your partner is willing to spend on you. I always believe in focusing on if they are willing to give you what they have the least. If he has a lot of money and has no time but is willing to give you his time, he loves you. If he has a lot of time and has no money but is willing to spend on you, he loves you.

She complains that the eggs that are supposed to be AA size and it does not meet the grade of 70gms at least. (She weighed each piece individually ????????‍) Tried explaining that the seller did indicate +/-70gms but she responded, her threshold is 69gms, anything less is not acceptable.I buy durians for the family because I know she loves them. She complains that the durians are not as good as the previous batch and has hard spots. (I tried it personally and think it’s alright & still nice) FYI, I only buy MSW and nothing less, but it is still not good enough for her. She forces me to feedback to the seller which makes me embarrassed every single time. (The seller confirmed the MSW is high mountain MSW and hence, flesh is thicker & creamier)She can leave her bags and mail wherever she likes for months but if I leave my mail over one day on the table, she screams at me to keep it. She loves to cook and will always try new recipes and insist the family try. She is not interested to listen to constructive feedback and perpetually praises herself for her wonderful creation. If you tell her she could perhaps make it better by doing this or that, she will cut you off by saying she thinks its nice & yummy.She takes forever to get ready to get out of the house but if so happen, once in a blue moon, she gets ready before me, she screams at me to hurry. But if you tell her to hurry, she will lose her temper.She is critical over my hairstyle, my complexion, my size, my child.

#102269,2022-03-05,"Subject: 50-50 Split in RelationshipI have been hearing about the so called general norms of setting up a joint acc and contribute to the said account for the expenses etc based on your income. Each couple has different arrangements. Let me share mine..My husband has been working in financial industry with senior positions, hence he brings more income for our household. Since our dating time,I have asked him what his preference is. Setting up a joint account and contributing x percentage according to our income? He proceeded to tell me that he will take care of all the bills and expenses. Let me keep my portion of salary (at this point of time, we never went for BTO as he already purchased his own property).And yeah we proceeded to do that. He paid all the household bills,groceries,car n house installments, even my online shopping bills, meal with my friends, all those big expenses like hospital bills and insurance plans. He said that since he earns way more,let him take care of me as it is his duty as a guy and as a head of family. He said he is looking for a wife and future mother of his kids, not a business partner, so why need to calculate so much? He asked me to keep my salary and encouraged me to keep working in order to have a sense of financial freedom, building my self confidence and to enhance my personal growth as well as networking. As a husband, he's going to be my pillar of support and I can always rely on him emotionally and financially. He is also giving me a small amount of monthly allowance as a token of appreciation. Now that we have a baby, I have quit my job since I cannot bear to be away from my baby, but I feel guilty for not working. Nevertheless, he told me that it does not matter, he will support my family's monthly allowance (I'm still giving monthly allowance to my fam btw) on top of providing me with extra allowance. Of course our savings will shrink, but he said why so calculative?His money is my money too. I have contributed a lot by being a mother to our baby, and he feels sorry for not being able to spend more time to take care of our baby due to his busy work schedule. He said I have worked hard and contribute so much in giving birth and sacrificing my careet in order to raise our baby, so he is doing the minimum he can do as a husband.I know every couple has their own arrangement..nothing is wrong or right, it really depends on their own circumstances and level of comfort. I really appreciate my husband as I know he is rare in the market (even all my friends told me so). What works for me may not work for others and vice versa. In return, what I provided to my husband is respect and prudence. I let him have his financial freedom and discourage him from making big purchases like buying branded goods for me or fancy car or posh private property. I'd rather he channel his cash for investment and saving plans. I'd rather not burden our finance by insisting to purchase fancy house or car for ""face"", but to do it when we can very comfortably afford the loan installments.That being said, every couple has different definition of being ""calculative"". I'm sharing mine as I would like to say that, husband will not lose anything by contributing more if they can afford to. Afterall,a wife will turn your house to home, carry your baby for 9 months, breastfeed and nurture your family, all while working as well. Can these being split 50-50 also? Down the road, there are roles which will continue to grow between husband and wife. I want my daughter to have a financial independence to build a family, but I also wish for her husband to treat her like what her daddy treats me. As such, I would also like my son to treat his future wife like how his father is treating his mother.Selflessness will trigger sincerity and gratitude.

How to know what your partner is really thinking or doing outside of the relationship without infringing his/ her personal space?I (24F, single) consider myself as an average person, and I have a fair mix of female and male friends because I am friendly and outgoing. I also enjoy talking to and meeting new people.Recently I have been using an online chatting platform and began talking to a guy. We chatted quite a lot and found out that we shared similar interests and worldviews. I was drawn to him and felt he was different from other guys who have previously expressed their interest in me. I would even consider being in a relationship with him after knowing him better. As time passed, we became more comfortable with each other, showing care for each other and also flirted a bit.However a few days ago, I came across his social media page and realised he was married! (He is much older than me). I was horrified and felt betrayed as he didn’t previously mention he was married despite me asking. And when I clarified with him about it, he told me he was looking for something along the lines of an affair (!!). I was really shocked and didn't expect it as he is in a prestigious career and a high-ranking position.Since then, I chatted less with him and he says we are just friends when I asked him his intentions for talking to me. Is what he's doing counted as cheating and are such occurrences common? I have never thought about and will never mess with others' marriages.

#102248,2022-03-04,"Regarding Quant Fin careers in response to post #102202Tldr: Quant Finance is not limited to CS. Math and Physics are valued too. What constitutes a ""Quant"" can vary tremendously from place to place. Prof Ben is right in the sense that a lot of Quant jobs these days are looking for CS majors. This is primarily driven by the fact that of jobs are at electronic market makers. They would be looking for hardcore software engineers for the most part, finance or math knowledge is unnecessary. At market makers like Jane Street or Wintermute, say 500 different ""buy"" & ""sell"" orders need to be filled every second. The role of ""Quant Traders"" isn't so much to trade, but to develop and maintain the algos that fill these orders. Calculating whether to fill or put on hold these orders, comparing relative profitability of each order etc. Algos like binary trees, acyclic graphs, queueing problems, graph theory will come into play. In contrast, there are prop trading funds whose job is to identify arbitrage opportunities in the market. A ""Quant Trader"" job here is to study the various asset classes via various mathematical transforms. Things like market cap, daily transaction volume, liquidity will be studied. Math comes into play in the forms of curve fitting, interpolations, signal processing in order to uncover arbitrage opportunities.No doubt, these places are less common than electronic market makers. So Masters in QF will have a harder time finding a job compared to CS people. But these places do exist.

Wondering why couldn't i just find someone who I could care for, and would care for me in return. Recently I created an account and sugarbook and started reaching out to the girls on there. Started seeing a handful of them on a regular basis, some are ok with sex, some are not. But it's fine, I enjoy the company of them all. Taking them out to dinner, chatting with them, sending them home. I choose those in the 19-22 age range. Some of these girls, for their own reasons need the money, and i'm happy to help them with it and make their life a little easier.It also helps that i'm in a job that pays well. Even after setting aside money for a rainy day, setting aside money to invest, there is a decent amount left over to reward myself with. And I gotta say, it feels good.

#102238,2022-03-04,"This story is going to be long...I dated my ex for about 2.5 years. We were happy in our relationship and because she has kinda low confidence so I often tried my best to support her as much as I can. However, her family didn’t approve of our relationship because I’m not locally born. We had to date in secret and it was worst when Covid struck due to the many restrictions. Naturally we drifted apart but we tried to see each other as often. One day, she asked for a breakup over text. No quarrel, no signs of unhappiness. We were still calling each other by our pet names the night before. She wanted to be friends and although I was shocked, I thought she just needed a break from me so I agreed. I found out that she started seeing someone less than a month after the breakup. I don’t think she cheated on me because she did told me that her cousin wanted to introduce her to somebody. She told me she has lost feelings for me nearing the end of our r/s. Me being me, I trusted her and I was sure she won’t be able to connect with that guy. Bam I was wrong. They started dating each other and all these while I was kept in the loop cos I was just a ‘friend’. She knew I still had feelings for her. One day, I couldn’t take it anymore and did the no contact rule. We bumped into one another by coincidence after 1 month NC and she initiated a meal. I went. It was a good time of catching up and we agreed to not talk about our relationship status. Soon, we began texting more frequently and went out to play/have meals regularly. She knew I still had feelings for her. Although nothing romantic, we had a simple dinner on Vday as well. I bought some stuff for her which she has accepted them too. I was surprised. I stand a chance right. All these while I wasn’t vocal about my feelings but I’m sure my actions show. If she has dated another person, she would not have agreed to go out with me so many times? And if she considered me as a friend, she would not have started dating so soon right? And like who would want to go out with her ex when she already has a new relationship?Bam. I was wrong again. Turns out they were officially an item around the time we reconnected with each other again. That is about 4 months since our breakup. Her family has also accepted the relationship.  Wow. The pain is intense. I cant fathom what her thoughts were. So any kind souls out there can help interpret why she did what she did? Yes I’m going to put it all down and move on. But I’m gonna use my last bit of energy to try and empathize her actions. A closure from me to me.

#102237,2022-03-04,"Just wondering what kind of family do y'all think would try to convince their future daughter-in-law to sign a prenup agreement?My fiance proposed last month and we talked to both sides' families as well. My parents were overjoyed but i kinda felt offended when his parents brought up the idea of a prenup agreement. My fiance currently earns slightly more than 1.5x of me and his parents will be leaving him $60k for his future once he turns 30. With that said, his net worth will probably be 3-4x of mine. I just finished paying off my study loan whereas my fiance was blessed enough financially. His parents said that in this era both man and woman should contribute equally to the household. Here comes the irony: when i asked whether my fiance should also contribute equally to household chores and raising the kids, they said that it is a woman's job. Tbh shouldn't the party with more money contribute more? Do they expect me to give birth to the children, feed and take care of them and also contribute equally to the household expenses? I'm really not sure whether they view every woman out there as golddiggers. I'm a pretty frugal person myself and do not splurge on luxury products. The only branded stuff i have is a pair of chanel earrings i got for myself when i graduated from university. Most of my meals are from food courts and i rarely visit high-end restaurants. Throughout the 5 years of dating, my fiance has never gifted me anything that costs more than $300+/- (except for the proposal ring). Because of this he was able to invest more money and he even said that he was thankful for me as his friends often complained about having to buy their girlfriends dior/chanel/iphones and bringing them to expensive restaurants or cafes.How should i convince them that it doesn't seem reasonable for me to sign the prenup agreement?-#102237: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102237",190 ,11 ,0,0,23,39,0,0,16,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

I know it's wrong to have feelings for a married man. But I cannot help but wonder what if he chose me instead. I thought I almost had him right where I wanted him. We have been texting daily. I met him for lunch once while he had errands to run and I pretended to be in the area. It felt like a lunch date, I was secretly elated. I placed my hand on the table, waiting for him to hold my hand but he didn't. It was hard trying to find excuses to meet him alone. He was always busy but he always had time to text me. He was incredibly private about his wife so I was never able to find out if he slept with her the night we text. I suppose since he talking to me, he's not touching her. I was able to find out what kind of women he like. I was able to make him do and say things but I just can't make him reveal anything when it comes to his wife.I have so much mixed feelings about him. I can't contact him anymore but I always see traces of him everywhere I go. When I meet someone I will compare the guy to him. I feel I'm not even allowed to be sad for losing him. Words spread and I have to stay away from mutual married friends because I guess his stupid wife talked. No matter what, my feelings are valid. Why do I have to be the one in hiding? He didn't resist when I got close to him! Maybe he didn't love me yet but he did enough to make me believe we have something special happening. I'm angry too. I feel grief yet I can't grief. Why did I get close to him? Why am I so drawn to him?  Did I misunderstood everything? He told me everything we had was wrong. I was so shocked and angry to hear him say that. I can't even tell him  I thought we had something special after he said that to me. We didn't reach a stage where we can define our relationship. So I was just a friend? I didn't feel that way. How can I accept this? Did he use me? I thought I had the upper hand all along and yet I feel shattered when he told me he don't want to see me again. I hate him and I miss him. He don't deserve to be happy for breaking my heart. I never uttered a single word to him after he rejected me. I will never let him know how I feel. He can carry on guessing for the rest of his life!-#102215: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102215",39 ,5 ,0,0,26,12,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

#102207,2022-02-28,"I have a toxic mother. She hurt me a lot but my daughter healed me.When I was a child, I grew up being told that I'm pretty by people around me. My mother would sign me up for beauty contests for little girls and I've won a few times. She was very proud of me winning those contests. Thinking back, I think she was living her dreams through me. I think I have a twisted view about beauty at a young age due to the lifestyle. I was too tall for my age and don't really look child-like enough and I was not developed enough for other ads that preferred teenagers so I don't have a lot of jobs. I remembered she cried once when I was rejected from a job due to my height. I was too tall, it was a group shot and I needed to blend in, not stick out like a giraffe. For a while I actually felt sorry for being tall. I was just following what my mother wanted me to do. I also remember her making me feel I was not good enough. She always reminded me to be grateful to her for giving birth to me. If I did good, she would say its thanks to her. If I did bad, she would say it's my own doing. The relationship between my mother and me changed when I became a teenager. I'm no longer a little girl. She started to hate me I guess. She would make fun of my appearance. Make snide remarks to me when I share with her about my life. Sometimes I felt she was competing with me. Took me many years to think she may be jealous of me. If someone praised me she would say its thanks to her that I'm like this or that. She would tell me my nose is so flat unlike hers and I should fix it. She would point out flaws about my face that I didn't even notice myself. Kept saying she looks taller than me. She's 163cm while I'm 168cm. I love to enjoy my food and she would tell me don't eat too much skin and fried food else I will become fat. I was around 45kg. It really messed up my mind then. I start to have a weird relationship with food too.During school orientation day, the school held a Mr. and Miss Popular contest. I won and was Miss Popular. I was excited to share the news with my mum. But she said I must have won because the judges are blind and there must be not much choices. She often use the chance to demean my looks. I have been pranked by boys who pretended to like me, only to run off when I let my guard down. So I became wary whenever a guy approaches me. My mum knew about it and have no sympathy for me. I felt I was never good enough for her. While my brother was always the best in her eyes. I finished school relationship free and started work. My mum told me  I picked a lousy job but she was boasting to her friends behind my back. I heard her talking to her friends on the phone while at home so I knew. I don't know why is it so hard for her to say anything nice to me for once. I was away half the time so I'm glad to have time away from her. So she has lesser of a chance to hurt me with her words. I met someone and got married. Had my own daughter. My mother offered but I decided to not have my mother involved in my child rearing duties. She may visit and play but I won't allow her to care for my child because I didn't want her to influence my daughter and be obsessed about looks.Other than my main job, I dabbled in arts and it grew and also became an online business. She told everyone I got my artistic skills from her. But she has no knowledge or experience in my craft. I did not show my face on my social media sites so I was sure I was being recognized for my talents. My mother did not hesitate to put me down too. Because of covid, one of my old art videos happened to get reshared half a million times. Business was boosted overall as a result. Of course my mother did not hesitate to tell me I was just lucky. My daughter has grown up and is a young teenager now. I swore to have a different relationship with my own daughter. Because of my childhood, I'm quite conscious of what I say to my daughter. My daughter is a very expressive young lady, once she thanked me for giving birth to her. It's just a short sentence but an impactful one to me. I cried buckets after she said it.On one side, my mother is constantly demanding I be grateful to her for being born. On the other side, my own daughter thanked me for having her and said it with ease. I feel I'm no longer the little girl wanting approval from my own mother. My daughter's unconditional love for me has healed me.-#102207: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102207",12 ,9 ,0,67,0,130,43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

If your boyfriend asks you to dress skimpily on campus so that he can feel your love or for whatever selfish reasons, my advice to you is please immediately dump his sorry ass!

#102201,2022-02-28,"Just a rant from the spouse of a junior doctor. My husband goes to work daily before 5am and only ends work after 7.30pm. Sometimes, he does 30h to 32h calls which is from 5.30am till 1pm the next day. He works more than 100h a week when the contract says not more than 80h. He works both weekends and once worked 20 days consecutively. It is common to work for 14 days in a row and I have heard some horror stories of his friends working 30 days straight without a day off. He doesn't reflect his true working hours in the system as if you get caught for working more than 100h, they won't investigate why you overworked, they will investigate why YOU overworked. Thus, to avoid all the troubles, it is a common practise to under report the actual working hours.My husband doesn't bring home much. His starting pay is $4k before CPF deduction and with all the on-calls and weekend half-days, that brings maximum another extra $1k - $1.5k. Is $5k justifiable for >400h of work per month? I don't think so.They have no time and energy for their loved ones. He comes home late and usually will continue reading up until he falls asleep at his desk. We hardly date because he has to work and albeit saying that he is not tired and he can go on a date with me, I know he is and I'll prefer to let him sleep in. We have been delaying our wedding because he is too busy and we are still saving up. Will MOH wake up their idea? No, that's why healthcare workers get claps and not a better working system.

She does freelance modelling and her IG is full of photos of herself doing blogshop modelling or event ambassadorship. She models for almost anything except hair, as she doesn't like others touching her hair.Few days back, she was due for an assignment for a sports themed photoshoot after class. She asked me to come along. The studio was set up within an industrial area and when we arrived, there were already many people there. An aunty immediately hurried her to the changing room, while I was left along to sit on the sofa. Within 10 min, my gf came out clad in the tiniest blue bikini I have ever seen, with only a few strings to secure. I honestly didn't realise she had such a nice figure before.To my horror, there were 3 uncles as the photographers. She seemed very much at ease with this. During the actual shoot, the photographers told her to pose in all kinds of poses, and I could hear them commenting on her body. My gf even laughed and joked with the uncles. The assignment paid well and she treated me to a nice dinner after. But I felt uneasy about it all. Somehow, it seemed so wrong.

My dad changed his phone number so i assumed he don't want any relations anymore with both the son & my mom. Fast forward to now, When i tell my mom something is wrong. instead of understanding the problem I'm trying to resolve, She will not listen.An example will be, - Insisting on handwashing clothes saying it's more clean that way. (now i would just past her the clothes to wash since she dont let me use the washing machine by locking it in the backroom). *Why make life more complicated when washing machines can help lessen the load i just dont understand.*- Complaining that back then she used to give her parents money when she worked. I am currently not giving her allowance as I have just started working recently. (Currently we are renting out a room & she is using the rental to sustain) and also, My brother has not given her a single penny either. I have told her to see a doctor for mental illness but she says I'm the crazy one. ""Where got ownself son say mom crazy ask her go see doctor one"". She will also sometimes guilt-trip me by saying I'm not the good son that used to listen to her all the time.

He seems kinda protective over this relationship and tend to divulge very few details to me about her and their meetups. Though they meet once every 3 months or so, bf will make an effort to rush over to meet her at their dinner place even though he usually has OT, then send her home after a 3-4 hrs dinner at a mid/high end restaurant. While her house is somewhat along the way, he had to take the further route home, pay for ERP and drive in/upslope to the estate, spending additional 15-20 min on his journey which is rather inconvenient. I came across his chat messages recently and found that he is always the one initiating to meet the female friend, offering to send/pick her home, asking how is her work going, celebrating her bday etc and she had never initiated once and never celebrated his bday. She also frequently left his messages on double tick and he had to double/triple text her to ask her out for a meal again.

He asked a lot of various questions over the next few weeks so I did my best to answer his concerns. Things start to get weird when he started to ask me about my personal life. I stopped answering and transferred the case to a male colleague and gave the reason that I'm 'on leave'. When I got back from 'leave', the customer's wife called and asked for me. She wanted to confront me. Because I have to be professional, I told her everything I said to him was in the chat, I have nothing to hide, so I left it as that and kept quiet. I'm so pissed. I'm just doing my job, I checked all the exchanges and also let my collegues check. My team agreed I didn't say anything out of line. She should be confronting her own itchy backside husband.

#102178,2022-02-28,I'm on talking terms with my neighbor next door. A single mother in her late 60s maybe and with her 2 single adults daughters in their 40s. Recently I got a letter in the mailbox from an unknown source. The letter says one of the daughter is a homewreaker and some other embarrassing details. Basically it described the daughter clinging onto another married man and being very brazen about it. I think the letter was mass produced and circulated. I guess the letter was made by someone's wife. Tbh I don't know how should I react to such a letter because both our families actually have regular contact. I told my husband to keep to ourselves for now but he has to reduce interaction with them for sure. Now I find it awkward should I bump into them. I'm pretty disturbed. Am I over reacting?My husband has helped them with some errands before during lockdown. Sometimes they need help with some tasks that require strength and I didn't mind that my husband go over to help in the past. But now I think I should just tell my husband don't help them anymore. Am I being petty? I know the letter could be fake. But there won't be smoke without fire.-#102178: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102178,37 ,4 ,0,3,0,9,0,0,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

At the start, he seemed quite enthusiastic in continuing the conversation as his replies were relatively long and he also asked me questions about myself. I seriously thought the conversation was going fine.But after a while, he stopped asking questions and his replies started to get really slow (like once a day) with one-liner conversation stoppers, e.g. “Oh i see” “yeah I think so too”. To me, this is an obvious signal that he is no longer interested in talking anymore, and I thought he probably didn’t want to be so direct in telling me that he is not interested. So after a few days, I stopped replying. Then he sent me a text and say how I’m being rude for ghosting him and that I should have the courtesy to let him know that I’m not interested to talk.

#102155,2022-02-28,"Hi everyone, need some advice regarding work and remuneration. I am with my current company for more than 2 years, and recently received remuneration results for FY2021, and again I will not be getting any increment for the second year.I did not receive increment for the first year despite working for about 10months in FY2020, reason my boss gave me was due to the company policy that they don’t gave increment to employees in their first year. I checked with a few of my senior colleagues and indeed they said it is true, and I accepted it. Then there were on-going restructuring in the team and they wanted to cut headcount, because the senior colleagues were reluctant to change and i kind of volunteered to change to the neighbouring team, which is also considered under the same department.Shortly after I transferred, i got pregnant and will be going to maternity in a few months time. Fast forward to the recent remuneration, again I won’t be getting any increment. Reason my new boss gave was because he only can assessed my performance based on the day i joined the new team and he can’t gave me increment for that few months, then i bring up that i will be away for 4 months this year and does that means I won’t be getting increment again next year. His first reply was “ya hor”, then the next sentence he added but i normally will assess based on what i gave the previous year, I didn’t know you did not get any increment last year because you were not with me. He further mentioned that lucky my maternity will be in the middle of year, cause he seen people normally get penalised when their maternity is during the end of the year. By right employer should not even penalised pregnant mummies for going maternity, but let’s not go into that topic.Based on what he said, I highly doubt that I will be getting an increment next year. But frankly speaking I am okay with my current job and do not wish to jump boat again so soon, but thinking of drawing a stagnant salary for 3 years made me think otherwise. Do you guys  think that I should look for a new job after my maternity or stay for another year and take the chance hoping my boss will give me an increment next year?-#102155: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102155",25 ,4 ,0,2,0,12,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#102151,2022-02-28,"Do you give your parents allowance, or help out with household expenses if you don’t? Or do you leech off your parents and live free or receive an allowance from them? (assuming your parents are not rich) Recently, I am shocked to hear someone who is 30+ and working is still receiving allowance of $1000 or more from their parents. In another case, my friend told me that her elder sister, who is also 30+ and married with 3 kids does not give her parents any allowance but still goes home to get free toilet paper, condiments, food and stuff. She would sometimes also make her parents pay for her food and gas when she brings them out for meals and exploits her parents to help her with stuff like buying food and delivering to her house. There are also people who are in their 30s and are unemployed just leeching off at home. I have a sibling like that too. My mother works a tough job and does not earn a lot. Ever since my first job right after secondary school, I gave my mom allowance unless I am tight on cash or is switching between jobs. My elder sister (9 years older) who earns almost double of me and is still single with no commitments did not give a single cent because she claims that she does not want to “fund” my mother’s smoking addiction (ok fine). I also contributed for household groceries most of the time but my sister would just eat free or claim groceries expenses from my mom. Usually after work, I would call to check with mom if she needs me to tabao dinner for her, knowing I would do this, sister would ask me to tabao her share conveniently (most of the time I ignored her request because she doesn’t pay me back and I was earning less than 1.5k at that time). During a period, I had part time night classes on certain days and would come home late so I couldn’t get dinner for mom. Knowing this, my sister would go out on these days and avoid mom calls and messages to buy food for her. She also frequently forgot her wallet or wait for us to pay when we go out to eat together as a family. I don’t know why some people are so calculative over small things (like a $2.50 dinner, or a drink) and cannot part with their money. I think it is not wrong and it is fine if you have commitments or conditions and did not give your parents allowance (some parents prefer to be independent) or help out with household expenses, but receiving money and exploiting them does not sound right to me. They don’t seem to feel embarrassed, guilty or remorse for exploiting their parents or other family members.

#102150,2022-02-28,"I got to know a guy from a dating app, and ultimately got together. He came to my house a few times for dinner and spend time together. He claimed both his parents has passed on and he does not have many friends, hence I have never met his family nor his friends. He was very nice to me and my parents, there are small actions that makes me feel he is genuine.After few months, he borrowed money from me and agreed to repay in x month when he got bonus. The repayment did not happen. When he failed to repay, and I was unhappy, he invited me to his place (as I have always wanted to visit him and he always push it away with all sorts of excuses). When I was there, he claimed that he owned the place and told me how much he has bought it, etc.One day, I found out that he has lied about his residence and the fact that he does not owned the place.Since then, I kept the secret that I knew about the fact, instead I texted him if he has anything to confess which he deny there is any. At the same time, I also keep pressing for repayment, even by instalments, but each time, he fails to meet his agreed repayment date.Subsequently when we met, I told him this fact calmly (no throwing of things or shout, etc), he thinks that I have confronted him and that he has good reasons not to tell me the truth.We broke up after that day, but I am still texting him trying to get back my money. I am still in love with him in the beginning and we still texted each other, hoping that he will returns the money and things between us will get back to norm. I tried finding out about his friends and message via fb some of them, hoping someone can tell me he is a kind person. Someone did reply but he is not able to provide me with his characters/information.As time passed, more and more lies have been uncovered/said.

#102149,2022-02-28,"I have a gf of 1.5 years. In the initial months of honeymoon period, everything was sweet and lovey dovey. Soon, I discovered she tends to use passive aggressive behaviours to communicate whenever something is bothering her. If I asked her, she would either say nothing is wrong or just give me the cold shoulder. When we were outside, we could be holding hands window-shopping and giving each other affectionate hugs and everything would be fine, but something would trigger her and she would just suddenly let go of my hand and refuse to show me any affection and give me the cold shoulder. Only when it's late at night, then she would write a long text to try and tell me how she felt and what the issue was. Initially, I really appreciate her doing that because at least she was communicating to me and we had a chance to address whatever the issue was. But I also told her that I don't appreciate such passive aggressive behaviours and hoped that she could communicate with me better.There was once when she accompanied me to shop for new pairs of specs. I ordered 2 pairs of specs and she took issue with one of the pairs, saying that the frame was too large and she hated how large frame specs look. I told her I thought it looked ok and even though it was larger than what I usually wear, I could try something new and who knows, the look may grow on her and she may come to appreciate it. To me, I thought it was just a minor issue of personal preferences. However, she became upset and accused me of not taking her opinion and feelings into consideration. I tried explaining to her that it's just a matter of personal taste and preferences and everyone is entitled to their own preferences. But she tried to justify her behaviour by saying that she hates the look of big frame specs and the look of it on me may cause her to lose attraction for me, so she doesn't want me to wear it because she doesn't want it to cause her to lose attraction. At the end, she suggested that since I ordered 2 pairs, that I never wear the one with big frame and only wear the other pair that she approves of whenever I am meeting her. For the sake of peace, I agreed to the compromise. But I couldn't get over the feeling that this is too controlling a behaviour. She may not like the specs but I am the one who is wearing the specs so my preference should take precedence, shouldn't it? It is just a pair of specs, not as if I'm doing something as drastic as getting a permanent tattoo on my body (not that I have anything against having a tattoo but is a pair of specs really worth getting upset and having an argument over?). Of course I could say that since it's not something worth getting upset and having an argument over, then I could just choose another pair of specs that she approves of to avoid all the headache. But that is beside the point because I feel that such behaviour is too controlling and unhealthy for a long-term relationship.Another time, I was shopping for coconut oil because I wanted to use it to improve my dental healthy by doing oil pulling. I gave her a brief explanation on what oil pulling was and she once again disapproved of my purchase. For those who may not know, oil pulling is the using of edible oil such as coconut oil to clean the mouth. It is done by swishing a tablespoon of oil in the mouth like how we would do it with a mouthwash, for 15-20 minutes before spitting it out and rinsing/brushing. It is an ancient practice from India that has been tried and tested by many and proven to deliver results and benefits. However, she said that the idea of me doing it grossed her out and she wouldn't feel like kissing me after that. I told her that it is not as if I'm kissing her immediately after doing it and with a mouth full of oil, I'd be doing it first thing after waking up and would be brushing my teeth after it, and it'd long after that before we would even have a chance to meet or kiss since we're not staying together. She got upset and once again accused me of not taking her feelings into consideration and accused me of not caring about whether she kissed me or not. I couldn't believe that we were having an argument over a bottle of coconut oil, over me wanting to improve my dental health, which would only benefit her because who would want to kiss someone with bad breath and bad teeth?Everytime we argue, she would also have a tendency to lament about how all our disagreements show how incompatible we are and that maybe we're not meant to be, and would either ask whether it'd be better for us to break up or just straight up threaten a breakup, only to apologise to me later and say that the treasures me and the relationship a lot and would never want a breakup. I addressed this issue with her telling her that I don't appreciate her constantly mentioning breaking up everytime we disagree and argue about something. She would apologise each time and say she would change but each time she would keep doing the same thing again and again. She would keep repeating the above mentioned behaviours everytime that she was triggered by something and we had an argument. I feel really unseen, unheard and disrespected by her constantly crossing my boundaries when I've explicitly addressed the issues with her multiple times. She even said that she did not really intend to break up each time but she just hoped that I would give her reassurance by ""chasing"" after her whenever she mentioned it, so she could feel that I still want the relationship. I think that is just absurd and I have also addressed that with her. How is that healthy behaviour/thinking for a successful long-term relationship? I love her a lot but the way she gets triggered over seemingly insignificant issues is really taking a toll on me. I am feeling really frustrated and tired of the constant arguments over the same recurring issues that have already been addressed before.I love her and I still believe that our relationship has the potential to work and I am not ready to give up on her yet, but at the same time I feel that her attitudes and behaviour is slowly chipping away at my sanity and my self-respect.

I start to respond back the same greetings.I found out that we have a few similar interests so sometimes she would send me related jokes so we would have a good laugh. I start to reply back the same. I thought since she knows I'm married there shouldn't be a problem as I see her as a younger sister. I was having some family issues then, and her jokes cheered up my day when I'm down. When she flirts with me, I flirted back to show her I understood. I notice she was texting me more often. I thought it was starting to feel weird, it felt like courtship? But I considered her a friend so I just continue to talk to her. She would ask me for help and guidance regarding work as well as her personal relationships. I feel bad for her because I get the sense she has a sad past and she seems to make childish decisions in regards to love. All this while I do not have sexual or romantic feelings for her. I do care for her as a friend. I also wonder why is she on my mind all the time. Sometimes she would take the jokes too far and mention my wife which I dislike. So I would ignore her. This continued for months until she was blast texting my phone one day while I was home and my wife saw the messages. I was still in denial mode when my wife confronted me about my relationship with this person. I defended myself and insisted I'm just friends with her. But I couldn't answer about the amount of talking and the amount of photos exchanged. I try to convince myself and also my wife it's just a normal friendship because I didn't touch that person.What made an impact on me that I've really done wrong was the reaction of my wife. I didn't know I can hurt her so badly. My wife didn't eat and sleep for over two days. She barely drank anything. I've never seen her in such a deranged state. She would suddenly wail, scream, sob, hit me, tell me she hate me. Hug me. Tell me she love me. To know I am the cause of her pain, I feel great shame and guilt, almost unbearable. I love my wife and I have no idea how to make things better for her. To know that she will never trust me again, I don't know how to make it up to her that I will never do anything like this again.I've since cut off all communications with this person and blocked her. She tried to get in touch with me but I don't care about her anymore. I also felt like I was being played by this woman. So there's no way I will rekindle this friendship.To people who always say once a cheater always a cheater. I have to disagree. Not everyone is like this. I never want to be that person again. I would never want to hurt my wife again. Else I will lose her forever. I would rather not exist anymore should I ever lose her this way. She's everything to me. She's my forever person. I want to grow old with her. Only her. And I hope she forgives me one day.-#102124: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102124",76 ,92 ,0,84,0,272,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

#102130,2022-02-28,"I need advice. I don't know what to do about my relationship with my boyfriend. I wouldnt go so far as to say that the relationship is toxic but I have the nagging feeling like this relationship seems off, like im forcing myself to believe that it will work and yet I don't want to break it off with my boyfriend because of the familiarity and the fact that I lost my virginity to him.I have been with my boyfriend for 1.5 years, and it started off loving and sweet, and eventually, we became intimate because it felt right at that moment. Initially our arguments were all regarding my mother's opinion about him ( my mum doesn't really approve of him amd doesnt like the idea of him, because of his academic qualification and earning potential) but I have since reassured him that I would choose to stay by his side despite my mum's disapproval, that him earning significantly lower than me doesn't matter because ultimately our incomes will combine and we will be sharing the financial burden when we start a family. Lately our arguments have become more heated ( most of the times it is because I feel upset about something he did and I would subconsciously show it in a way by refusing to show him affection like holding his hands or hugging him, and he would flare up at me for showing him 'attitude'), to the point where he will shout at me when we are back in his room. I cry everytime he shouts at me, and his anger still wouldn't subside no matter how I try to communicate with him. I have tried showing him affection during the arguments to try to appease him, but when I can still sense his anger and see the intense anger on his face, I get scared and pull away and he will get angrier at me for not trying to appease him by showing him affection. There was once when he got so angry that he punched the wall till his knuckles bled and were bruised. His anger seems to get more and more intense with each passing argument. Every time during our arguments,  when I would cry, he doesn't even flinch or react to me crying. And yes, I do know that he is feeling emotionally negative and angry at that moment and I shouldn't expect him to care about my emotions, but it still feels like he doesn't care that he has made me cry. I don't know what to do about this relationship. My male friends have advised me to break it off with him, saying that his temperament and anger might just get worse in the long run, that no matter how angry they were at their partners, they have never shouted at them till they cried or shouted at them in public ( he has shouted angrily at me in public to hold his hands when I was walking ahead of him).  I'm reluctant to break up because i feel like this 1.5 years will be wasted if I just let this relationship go ( he was one of the few guys that didn't ghost me after meeting up from a connection on a dating app, I have been ghosted so many times after meetups, that I feel unworthy of love), I don't think I have the emotional energy to get to know someone new all over again ( I am an introvert and opening up and getting close to someone is nerve wrecking for me), being with him on the good days feels so nice and loving and I cant imagine being so vulnerable and familiar with someone other than him on such a physically intimate level.What do I do? Am I self sabotaging this relationship by thinking about all the bad and not looking at the good? ( But there seems to be more bad days than good) Thank you for taking your time out to read this lengthy post. I would appreciate any advice.-#102130: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102130",78 ,10 ,0,16,0,25,0,21,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

#102120,2022-02-28,"TLDR; what to do if the guy you had a one night stand with turns out to be your superior at work? it was 4 years ago when covid was non-existent, when i went clubbing with my friends every weekend. sometimes i only get a little tipsy whereas sometimes i got drunk. there was this one day where my friends were quite hyper so we kept drinking the whole night and got drunk. i remember being left alone with one or two friends while the rest went somewhere else. this was when the guy in question (lets call him guy A) came over and talked to me. I can only vaguely remember parts of our conversation but i think it was a good one as we kind of made out afterwards. somehow we ended up in a hotel room and things went down that night. after that night i found out he has a gf through his social media. he sent a message to me on instagram but i didn’t bother to reply since i found out about his gf.  fast forward to today, i recently got a job which i was really happy about since i really love my job scope. however i found out that guy A is in my department and i also have to report to him often. so at first i have no choice but to suck it up and pretended like nothing happened. btw he is now single after breaking up with his gf. the first few weeks of work was still not bad. he did not hint about that night at all so i assumed he must have forgotten about it but things started to get weird the past few days. i often catch him staring at me when i was doing my own work. when i looked back, he maintains eye contact for few seconds before smiling abit and looking away. these few days he would also buy starbucks for the department but get me a totally different drink from the rest, he got the same drink for them while for mine he got caramel macchiato which i always buy in the morning so maybe he noticed that but its still weird to only get me a different drink. nowadays he would also compliment me more than the others even though i did not do anything big. my intuition tells me that he will soon try to talk about that night we had. am i thinking too much into things? a part of me is hoping that he wont bring up that night from 4 years ago to save the awkwardness. yet another part of me is fantasizing about a potential office romance that could blossom. i know it sounds really ridiculous and sounds like a mediacorp script but this is really happening to me. i would like to know, if this happens to you, what would you do?

#102115,2022-02-28,"TLDR: Jealous of my best friend's new friend (??!!)A was my closest buddy for 10 years. We texted almost daily on random shits, out once weekly and 2-3 times overseas together yearly. He's probably my one and only best friend and confidant. I noticed that our friendship started to diminish after my marriage (during covid period). I usually kept my dating/marriage life low profile and my interaction with A continued as per normal even after I got married, except that I got to balance my time/outings between him and my wife and he don't mind at all. But I started to sense a hint of desperation in him as he started to venture a lot into dating/making friends app and he would share his encounters with me.  Generally, all his dating didn't go well and he decided to make new friends instead. He got to know a guy friend, B about 6 months ago. A told me that B shared many similar traits as me and wanted to introduce me, hoping we could be best trio buddies. I'm excitedly open to it (we have been wanting to get more new friends into our circle) and we went out for dinner together. We got along well but I don't sense any connection with B at all. It seems more like a ""go-along with A to meet me plan"" rather than genuine wanting to befriend me. I'm also taken aback by how close they are. A shared everything with B, literally everything in terms of his whole life stories, his family and friends. B expressed shock about me going overseas with A and his family and this kinda irk me a bit. I mean why is it so shocking? I have known A for 10 years now and it shouldn't be surprising to know each other family too. And now B is planning to visit A's place and family and even plan to go overseas together. Their interaction/friendship seems very close, almost comparable to ours. Along their conversation, I also came to know that they often meet and went to some outdoor activities together last few months and it kinda hit me hard because A been declining to go out with me and claimed he's busy and recently our text conversation is getting lesser too. B didn't initiate any contact with me after that dinner and A didn't talk about it either. Other than that, A and i still get along well, just less interactive. I can't help but wonder if I'm falling out of close friend proximity with A and I think I got jealous (??!!!) with B. I know this sounds weird but this has been weighing on my mind for a while now and I can't help getting anxious and feeling down about it to a point that I started to distance myself away from him. I regretted this whole thing about wanting to get more friends into our circle because now it seems like I'm losing my one and only buddy.Am I thinking too much or is this a normal feeling and what can I do about it? I would really appreciate some opinions here because I can't really share this with A, he will probably creep out. Lol. And in case you are wondering, nope we are not gay or linked romantically and they are not gay either so please don't go into that category.

#102112,2022-02-28,"Hi Everyone, I would like to ask the public opinion on what you would do given my situation. I am 29 years old holding a exec job taking home around 4k sgd. My take home would be 3200. Ever since I started working 4 years ago, it does took me a while to hit this 4k salary. However, I suddenly faced a huge bill given that my own 68 year old mom wasn't insured much and she got stage 3 lung cancer. She went for surgery then a few rounds of chemotherapy. We went for the C ward for a while before my mom is allowed to come home. The costs eventually piles up and we finally saw the final bill. There were also additional costs to see the lungs through this special scope and whatever tests to see the tumour. My dad asked us as kids to pay 20% each as my dad is running out of cash. He doesn't earn much given his job as a hawker helper and mom didnt help him out ever since she got sick. My elder brother and elder sister said they can only afford 5% given that they need the money for their own house and their kids. So suddenly, im being made to cover the shortfall. I emptied my entire savings to save my mom as my dad could only afford 40% of it and i covered the entire shortfall with my useless brother and sister giving only 5% each. Then, comes my next problem. As the youngest child and still staying with my parents under the 4 room hdb, im suddenly tasked to take care of my mom at home as well. My mum also still need to go for her periodic chemo runs. Not just that, i need to help her out on daily tasks, get her food, feed her, bring her to toilet, all these while working from home. My mom is super weak after all these runs and I asked my brother and sister for help... all they could do is to bring their children over to cheer my mom up during the weekends and help out during weekends. Financially, they told me they can spare about $100-$200 only. I didn't want to bother my boyfriend initially but eventually i asked him for help. He is very angry at my useless siblings but I really dont want to start a fight between my brother and sister. He finally moved in with me so that he can work from home to help me out. He chipped in to pay some of the daily items for the 4 of us under one roof but we simply just can't go on like this. We got no savings every month, my wedding is not done, my bto is going to be built by end of this year and i can't just leave my mom alone. I am very lost as i type this and I do not know what else is there to do. I just simply don't earn low enough to get financial help, im stuck with a lot of bills, my useless mp gan kim yong said he can't help given our household income and even my own 72 year old dad's health is on a decline as well. I am really out of options, my worst nightmare would be if my dad eventually falls along with my mom.

I did not reveal my real name in the game or online but have added others so that we can send gifts (with location tags) to each other.  There is this guy (I did not know he was on my friend list since we did not use real names) in the group who loves to brag and posts obsessively about his achievements. The thing is I noticed he had been cheating in the game so I called him out for misleading other players and making people feel bad for not playing enough. The way he responded to me and other players, well, I suspect he is mentally unsound and not worth my time. So I decided to just ignore him and not respond anymore. I also blocked him since I don't want to see him post 50 screenshots of what he did daily in the game. The issue here is that he had been using a fake account. He created new accounts and message me to harass me. I did not respond to him and blocked him again. This cycle repeated about 5 times. He made new accounts whenever I blocked him. I gave up and stopped blocking him. He messaged me to tell me he knows my real name, know how I look like and knows where I stay (guessing from the game gifts from the location tags before I removed him on my game friendlist, I assume he's lying just to scare me). I thought he is a psycho but I'm not fearful because I stay on private property and I can just report him for trespassing if he ever shows up. He has since made more new accounts on other social media platforms  to message me or speak to me in groups that I'm in.I have stopped playing the game for over 6 months and he is still one sided talking to me to 'one-up' me about a game that I don't play anymore. Is what this person doing illegal? Can I sue him for harassment? Since he is only harassing me using fake accounts. I can't really pin who because I don't even know who is this person.

#102103,2022-02-28,"I need opinions and advice. For the past year let’s just say a wife has been “chatting” with a guy who was said to just be a friend. However it was came into realisation that this was more than just a “companion”. Love messages were exchanged between the 2 parties. When confronted, the wife blamed it saying that she lost her young days to marriage and that just because she has kids that does not deters her from living her life. Their life was fun and enjoyable before she started messaging and calling this guy. Despite having kids who all persuaded her not to keep in contact with this guy, she does not listen or even if she does, it’s empty promises where she spends all her time texting and calling him in secret. Now she’s claiming for a divorce when she is the one who cheated. The husband and wife are pretty old in their 50s already. The husband does not want to let go and still clings on the little hope left that she will stop keeping in touch with the guy. Just to let you know, the guy is not in the same country, he has a family with kids as well and works as a taxi driver in a different country from where he was born. Many people tried talking to the husband and wife to resolve issues but nothing would work because the wife would not leave the guy. She bought multiple phones to secretly meet in touch with him during work hours and on the way home to avoid suspicions. When the divorce matter was raised by the wife, the husband suggested that she paid 50-50 of everything as he contributed majority expenditures of the house and electricity. When she suggested to live separately, she did not pursue it as she did not have enough money to pay the rent. The husband tries to bring the spark back in the marriage but the wife does not cooperate or tries she would just ignore and not speak. She acts very formally towards her kids as well.

#102092,2022-02-28,"tldr: My bf has too many priorities and I feel bad for “wasting” his time on datesHoping to get some advice here.My bf and I have complete opposite personalities. He is very outspoken and have many friends, whereas I am an introvert that keeps mostly to myself. One thing about my bf is that he’s a very caring and “fatherly” kind of person as he’s the oldest son in his large family, which was what attracted me to him in the first place. However, this seemed to have become a double edged sword, as he is constantly trying to take care of and solve problems for everyone around him. Sometimes I feel like I’m dating a VIP, having to always vie for his time among his friends and family. Even when we are spending our precious weekend hours together (we are both working FT), his phone will always be buzzing non-stop from the never ending texts. He even paused halfway through when we were doing the deed once to check his texts…The thing is, he has never once asked to cancel our plans to meet his friends and has always assured me that he will try to put our relationship first. But the moment we agree to postpone or cancel any plans he will immediately be “booked” by someone else. This just makes me feel guilty for spending time with him. It seems like I am occupying his precious time when he could be using it to help someone else. And I don’t want him to feel obligated to be spending hours with me when his mind is clearly someplace else. I have spoken to him about how this was bothering me before and can see that he is trying to balance out his time but it is clearly not working. He just has too many priorities. I love this guy very much but I just don’t see how this will get any better, especially when he has hinted on getting married and having kids together one day.-#102092: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102092",23 ,4 ,0,14,0,29,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

He respects me and treats me very well. We are planning to get married this year. Once i broke this news to my friends they started discouraging me. They said I’m rushing and i should find someone my age. I also have few friends saying he is a good catch and i should go ahead before he finds someone else. But I don’t understand why everyone make it sound like it’s either one of us benefiting from the other? Is 8 years too much of age difference for just real love?

On the other hand, when the guys arrange our outing they will always include me and make sure that I can make it, even as far as rescheduling the outing to a new date just so that I can attend. This vast difference in treatment is really putting me in a dilemma, on one hand, I would want to leave the clique as the girls don't seem to welcome me anymore but on the other hand, I think it is stupid of me to give up my guy friends just because the girls don't like me?I'm also not the type that would confront others and I cry when I get too angry and overwhelmed (LOL shucks to be me ); ) so I don't think I'll ever confront the girls.

#102076,2022-02-28,"Last week I applied for a credit card online from Bank A, and I was very surprised to receive an email to find out it was rejected. In the email the bank did not reveal any reason and mentioned that I could get a free credit report from the Credit Bureau Singapore.I was totally shocked after reading through the credit report. In the Account Status History, it indicated that I had one credit card from Bank B which I canceled it in 2015, and this credit card was marked ""voluntary closure with outstanding balance"" with the outstanding amount being $0.65.I remembered that I canceled this credit card through a call and was never been informed there was an outstanding balance by the bank staff.And I have never received any letter / messages regarding this balance as well. I even doubt if this amount existed before I asked for the account closure, as there was no point I could leave a $0.65 outstanding balance. And why would the staff close it if the money had not been paid off.Now the problem is - this is affecting my credit rating. I'm a bit lost as to what I can do. Can I still pay back the $0.65 to the bank since the account has already been closed? When will the records be removed from my credit report? I'm worried it will affect my credit when I apply for other credit cards or housing loans.Your advice are highly appreciated.-#102076: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102076",43 ,8 ,0,0,18,25,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#102074,2022-02-28,"Seeing all these BTO related problem posts these days, word of advice: don’t BTO just cause you’re eligible for it. BTO only when you both have started working, best if you have stayed together for a while. Why do you think there are so many SBF etc available? Lots of couples break up while waiting for their BTO because they did it too young and only realized halfway through. Many of my friends who BTO when they were 21 cause they didn’t want to ‘waste time’ ended up breaking up. At 21 when you’re still a student, you barely know yourself much less living with another person while taking on such a huge debt and responsibility. On the other hand, those who made decision later after they graduated, they are still going strong now. Don’t rush. Graduate first. Then BTO.

Long hours, working through weekends with no compensation, lots of contractors who are not renewed (low motivation). At least personally I don’t care about titles, what i care about is the salary. And i made that clear to her too (respectfully). Although it irritates me that she spoke to me in such a tone throughout and looked down on “young people”, i was respectful to her.The position i applied for is not a mid career position, it is a rather junior position, so i guess she has no choice but to hire young people with less experience? Yet she talk to us in such a rude manner.Well, old bird, please learn more about these “young people” and respect them as human beings if you want us to join your project.

#102072,2022-02-28,"Currently a Year 3 med student and it just dawned on me that soooo many of my peers are alr attached. So many intracohort couples omg. Have been reading up on the BTO delays etc and can't help but feel that I'm going to be missing out on so much if I don't get serious soon. Yes, call it FOMO, w/e you want. I know comparisons like these are not necessarily be healthy.But I wanna get married one day. I wanna get tgt with a guy who loves me, and raise children together with him as part of a loving family.After going through CNY and yet another V day single, I've decided to take the first step and explore the unknown world of relationships. My first meaningful interaction with guys was in JC (had been in a girls' school for pri and sec school). I was asked out by three guys while in JC. They were really sweet but I turned them down them because I wanted to prioritise my studies and focus on my work all the way. I felt that I didn't have the emotional availability and maturity then to deal with relationships. Recently saw their IGs. Two of them look so happy with their gfs. Yeah, I know, social media can paint a distorted perception of reality since people only upload the best moments of their lives - the carefully edited and curated moments that they want to show the world. But still... I constantly think back and wonder how things would have been like if I had just decided to give it a shot and tried dating I think it's unfortunate that clinical training is structured the way it currently is. Opportunities to meet guys in my cohort are pretty limited partially because clinical year med students are grouped into clinical groups (or CGs). And from what I understand, we generally stick with this group for the rest of medical school. Really regret not getting to know the guys in my cohort during the first two years of med school. :XShould I just deactivate my IG to stop exposing myself to my peers' snapshots of their wonderful lives? And so many of the girls in my cohort... I can't help but feel it's so unfair.

#102070,2022-02-28,"I’m not trying to keypoh my sister’s relationship or personal life but she is already 28 and still single, and as an elder sis, what happened recently really put me in a dilemma state.A friend of my sis bought an apartment, but he and his wife have recently been posted overseas for work purpose, so they rented out the place and let my sis take one room for free because they wanted her to help them to look after the house. They also managed to rent out a room to a Malaysian male, Jon (not his actual name). That doesn’t bother my sis at all because the place is only a few mrt stops away from her workplace.My parents and I would occasionally send my sis back to her apartment, and this is also the first time she moved out from home, so we did help with some housekeeping and new furniture, and we get to see Jon quite a few times. He is quite buff, well-built, good-looking IMO, highly educated with a phd in some pharmaceutical/biochemical field, and communicates with my parents really well. There was once my parents and I went over, he just cycled back home but we were about to order food delivery, he even offered to walk out to help us buy. During the entire dinner, there was no awkwardness at all, as he blends really well with my family, and he didn’t hesitate to answer some sensitive questions that my parents asked, like how often he returns to Malaysia, what are his parents job, does he have a girlfriend, and so on.My parents seem to like him a lot and they’ve always been hinting my sis to go for him, like it’s hard to find such guys with all these combination, but my sis will only find excuse like he’s not her type, she’s too busy with work, she has no time for a boyfriend, she’s not ready to settle down, all kind of excuses. Honestly if I’m not attached, I would definitely go for Jon.Strangely, one weekend after doing my grocery, I dropped by at her place to pass her some food. When I arrived, she was in the shower, but her room was opened, so I sat inside to wait for her. What really shocked me was the scent of Jon’s perfume lingering in her room. I can recognise the smell of the perfume or cologne that he uses, and I don’t expect such masculine fragrance to appear in my sis’ room. Not only that, that smell further guided me to check whether there's any short hair in the room. As I expected, I found some short hair on her bed, and that clearly doesn't belong to my sis. To clear my doubt, I proceeded to knock on Jon’s door and find a good reason to talk to him so that I can confirm the smell. As he was doing some search on his laptop, I could smell the exact same fragrance in my sis’ room.Now I knew that Jon has actually been into my sis’ room, though I’m not sure what exactly they have done together. Frankly speaking my sis is out of his league, her look is pretty much average, and the only thing attractive about her is her petite body with nice boobs and perky butt, and that might be something that Jon is interested in. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out whether they’ve been sleeping with each other every night, but there is still a small possibility that they may just be normal housemates.Maybe my sis and Jon are in a fwb relationship, and I don’t have the right to stop what she’s doing. I’m not sure whether they’re already together but refused to announce their relationship. I’m also unsure if they’re just fwb. What I’m really concerned is that my sis might have fallen for him, but he is just using her for relief.Should I talk to her about it? I know I shouldn’t tell my parents about it, but what should I do?-#102070: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102070",113 ,17 ,0,0,90,45,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#102069,2022-02-28,"My bf & I met almost a decade ago in NUS and we have been in a relationship for so many years. Saw the other post about the couple having an upcoming BTO & having limited time to meet due to busy work schedules (& the seventh year itch) and it somewhat resonates partly with me as I think I might be  facing similar issues with my bf as well.At the start of the relationship, it was really sweet as we get to spend almost every day tgt as we attend lectures and have meal breaks tgt. However, ever since work started few years ago and both of us having to work shifts and long hours (on weekends as well so it's hard to match schedules), it's been harder to meet and spend time with each other (approx meet for a meal tgt every 1-2 weeks) but I am still overall happy & satisfied with the relationship. Recently (over the past months especially), his work is becoming more busy and I am starting to feel much more neglected..I am ashamed to & dare not tell my friends and family that sometimes I don't even get messages replies from him the whole week. I know that he is not a texter but it disappoints me that while we are out for meals he would be taking some time busy replying to his work messages (which I would have appreciated if I'm his colleagues needing his inputs) but yet while we are not tgt I've to wait for his messages the whole week or more. I know I am partly to blame for this because I tolerated this practice for so long & maybe I spam too much over so many things (some trivial things as well) that it's hard to reply to & he's becoming used to ignoring me.. but he's the one I would like to talk to about everything and anything.. though I think I might also have stressed him a bit talking about wedding related stuffs (which I would definitely contribute in sharing for the related costs payment)we would be getting our bto keys soon & sometimes I feel really sad thinking about how I don't even get the bto proposal or any proposal yet (as I was kind of the one who suggested to bto-the practical me spotted a good bto location and we discussed and lucky us got it at first try too & I've discuss with him and set the rom date to be in line with our keys collection). It sometimes feel like he's making minimal effort in the relationship.. I know that I shouldn't be jealous of others' relationships because each relationship have their own issues that outsiders may not know but can't help but feel envious when my close friends (who have got together with their partners for half the duration of my relationship) have gotten sweet engagements recently & meanwhile my relationship have become more mundane. Overall he's been a pleasant partner who has been quite encouraging and supportive e.g. whenever I face issues at work etc (as both of our jobs can be quite stressful at times), he would offer me moral support & a listening ear when we meet. He also takes effort to treat me on occasions eg. my birthday & I treat him during his too & its still a stable relationship and I am happy every time we meet but at the same time still hope that he will try to make more effort than what he's doing now sometimes. For example, if I don't ask him to meet, we probably won't be meeting for that weekend because I guess he would assume that I'm busy. I think that we have come a long way and definitely don't wish to give up on this relationship and hope that we would be able to overcome all challenges & may the 'busy phase' be over. I want him to do well for his work too but not sure how long more I can stand this lack of effort & response before I break down.-#102069: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102069",33 ,6 ,0,14,4,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Bragged non-stop about his wealth; bragging about his car watch etc and kept talking about cars, even called me clueless for not knowing about certain car models??? Like hello do you think i could even understand half of what you were saying? You should have taken the hint when i showed that i wasnt interested but instead you kept continuing2. Debated about politics. Complained A LOT about the party he dislikes. Isn’t that our first date? You really had to talk about politics on the first date? 3. No table manners. The restaurant we ate at was a little atas and he chose the restaurant so ofc i would expect at least some table manners from him. But the whole time he was just shaking his legs till the table would shake sometimes and he kept making loud noises with his cutlery. I was so embarressed when people kept looking over at our table -.- 4. Very hao lian, keep comparing himself to hollywood actors. Keep saying that he thinks he look like Ryan Gosling and had the cheek to ask me if i agree with him. Please la… not even close. Ryan Gosling’s eyes alone can beat your entire face..5. VERY RUDE to waiters and waitresses. Not a single please or thank you to them. He was even impatient with one of the waiter when he brought the wrong drink over6. I thought we were going dutch and I don’t know if he was joking or what but he said “so today you paying for me hor” which i politely declined and offered to split the bill. He hesitated for a while before agreeingIt was my first time experiencing such a lousy date and i ghosted him the next day.

#102044,2022-02-28,"To OP of #102016I was in the same situation as you, and this is a quote by Jack Ma that gives me strength to live on everyday after divorce and being a single parent: Today is hard, tomorrow will be worse, but the day after tomorrow will be sunshine.Have the courage to enter a law firm and sign the divorce agreement with your husband. There will be social stigma, there will be many moments when you feel so alone and helpless and that people are judging you. You may face shame in front of your parents and relatives and guilt towards your child.But everyone makes mistakes. What is worse than a failed marriage with kids is staying in a failed marriage with kids. You need to distance yourself from your husband, but at the same time make proper care arrangements for your child after divorce. Your child is unfortunate to be in a broken family, but he will be even more pitiful if he is in an intact but acrimonious family with parents constantly arguing. If your husband does not want the child, you take control and custody and try your best to bring up your child. It’s your responsibility as a mother, whether you like it or not. If he does not want to see the child, then so be it. Your child will initially be depressed for not seeing the father but he/she will feel better over time though he may never fully recover depending on the closeness with his father.Meanwhile, you distance yourself from your husband after divorce for at least six months to two years. Give both of you time to heal and grow. Forgive him for the hurt he has caused you, and in the process you and he can learn to love someone else better in the future.-#102044: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102044",0 ,1 ,0,7,0,26,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Flame of romance died out when kids came into the picture, had an affair and wife found out etc. Now we are apart and living separately while trying to figure out what we want. For her she isn’t keen to give another chance out of fear that this will repeat (this is not the first time). While everyone is asking me to do the right thing for children, I’m having trouble letting go of the affair. Almost every thought I have, activity reminds me of what I had with the other party. And it feels like I could be vulnerable and honest with the other party while with the wife I always couldn’t and always keep secrets from - for fear of being judged or seen to be disgusting or perverse. Wondering if there are people here who have divorced and have children and whether it’s as bad as it sounds in terms of children’s growth.

#102036,2022-02-28,"Just a bit of a rant, but I would also like to hear your thoughts on this. I've been on dating apps and met some girls for dates. The thing which I've noticed happen is that some girls would agree for a subsequent date (after one or few dates), only to not get back to me (when they said they'll check which days they're free and get back to me etc.) when they said they would. Wouldn't it make more sense for the girl to just say that they don't see it going further, and let the guy know that they would not want to meet again?It is quite disrespectful, and gives false hopes (especially when they reply with much positive energy when agreeing to meet again). I see them not getting back to me as a sign that they're clearly not interested so I wouldn't want to send follow-up messages asking if they know when they're free already etc., but I would had much rather they be more respectful and not do things like this.Not all girls are like that of course. I've had some girls who let me know when they didn't want to meet again, and I really appreciate that.-#102036: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102036",26 ,2 ,0,7,0,20,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Many people have been asking why I am not attached and I mainly get away with it by saying that I want to focus on myself and know what I want, not just for love but also my life in general esp when I am so independent. It's true, but partly true.The more unknown side is that coming from a single parent family, I feel the need to stay by my parent (albeit all the nagging that I should find someone to settle down with). I'm aware that most people do not understand as they are not in my shoes. The past few years have been a whole new level of struggle because of different things (not covid related) and I want to show that I am still here for family amid all the tumultuous times. Though things are better, I could still be present here just in case. I've been working a lot and trying to stay home where possible so at least I am at home when my parent wishes to have a conversation with anyone at home. The good thing is that covid has made it an easy excuse to stay home, but I wonder how long this can continue.When I hear of friends say they want to settle down or they are ready to get their own house to move far away from their parents, I feel a little envious but also a little regretful. Could it be that I am thinking too much about wanting to be here 24/7 for my family that it is taking an unknown toil on me and my mindset, or could it be that people do not realize how important it is to be present for their family until difficult times strike?-#102032: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102032",9 ,2 ,0,10,0,25,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

#102021,2022-02-28,"I know there are a lot trolls here, but there a couple legit advice as well. So here goes, this is my rant. I'm male, engaged, working a decent paying job, renting a decent condo with my fiancé. Nothing too fancy, but we have enough. The problem is my fiancé has some deep insecurity issues whenever she's compared to her step-sis. Her dad remarried and she's brought up by her step-mom, who instill a damn fierce sense of rivalry with her step-sis.How this become my problem? Cuz when the topic comes up, she will start comparing everything in our lives to her sis. Don't get me wrong, I love her very much EXCEPT this part of hers. We gel well and everything is fine, but one hint of her sis will make everything go to s**t. She's normally a strong career woman, who is economical and logical. But once her sis comes into a picture, suddenly she transforms into this materialistic monster.Example: when we went for fam visit this CNY, I f***ing shivered when my sis-in-law arrived. This normally mild mannered woman will suddenly compete with her step-sis about LV bags, jewellery, engagement ring, me to the sis-in-law's husband. It's ironic that they're both women when this is nothing but a d**k measuring contest. Then the bomb shell reveal, my sis-in-law is pregnant. One look at my fiancé's face, and I thought ""oh.. f***...""Sure enough when we went home, it became a huge argument. Why they can have kid already? Why her husband is a CEO's son? Why are they living in luxury? Why her husband is earning close to 10k upon graduation?Well sorry not everyone born with a silver spoon in their f***ing mouth, some of us have to work from the bottom. We have enough and actually should be grateful that we're pretty well off. If she wants to start trying for a kid, that can be arranged, I'm already saving up anyways. Plus it's HER that says she's not ready to have a kid yet cuz she wants to pursue her career first!! I've told her plenty of times, if she's that unhappy with me, she's welcome to break it off, then she's free to find a CEO's son to leech off.But it's always the same story, the next day after a d**k measuring big argument, she would apologise and say that she's actually very happy with me and loves me very much. Then she would return back to being normal and sensible. I've begged her time and again to go see a professional psychiatrist, cuz what her step-mom did to her definitely messed up her brain. And she does know she has this personality switch too. But she refuses cuz she's too proud and doesn't want to let her step-sis and mom found out it affected her this much...I told her to stop following her step-sis on social media already, cuz that will make her more jealous. No, don't want, want to have a fight on how I can't compare up to the CEO's son everytime her step-sis post some new gift she got from the husband... haiz... Again, I love her when she's in her normal mode, but I am toying with the idea of breaking it off cuz I don't want to deal with this the rest of my life... sounds a bit selfish.. but is it? Am I selfish to be tired of constantly compared too? Or to not want to always burst out into a huge fight every time my sis-in-law got a new branded bag?I tell my fiancé already, why she have to compare herself to a obvious gold-digger? She would say s**t like ""a woman's success should not be measured by her man's wealth"", but then complain why her step-sis husband is CEO's son and I'm not? I'm all for women-empowerment but wtf???Haiz... any legit advice? Other than talking with her?

We have discussed and she has plans to quit the workforce and be a full time stay home mum when the child is born. In the last 2 of her jobs, she was unlucky to be in toxic workplaces and it has pretty stressed her out. We had also agreed that it is good she would take care and be fully present for our kids during their growing up years and it will allow me to concentrate on my career also. We have plans to have 2-3 kids eventually. She currently earns about 60+k per year and we won't have this income anymore in a few months' time. For myself, I earn slightly above 100k per year but I foresee that the future increases in the next few years won't be substantial as I am nearing the ceiling of the market rate for my type of job. Unless I go into management or totally change industries, which is really not my preference.Our home is currently a 5 room resale flat with monthly payment of 2.5k per month for the home and reno loan paid with CPF and cash. We have no plans to change houses for a long time as the place is big enough even with 3 kids. Insurance about 500+ per month for the both of us and I believe it will go up as more kids come along. Other than these, we have no other major fixed expenses. We also have no other passive or investment income as we are not experts in investments and most of our savings have went into the house and wedding and our remaining funds need to be saved for the future kid's expenses.

I married my husband because I thought he has the same values in marriage as me.Frankly, I don’t care how much a guy earns. We can always work hard together for our financial goals. The most important to me is to have a husband who will be able to spend time with me and our children. I thought he was that guy. But now, it feels as though his career is top priority. Choosing to meet & train his guys last min instead of spending time with me and baby. Hey. I am perfectly fine if there’s planning involved. If this training was schedule. It is fine. But he is meeting them at NIGHT. LAST MIN. Choosing to meet his friends also. At NIGHT. LAST MIN. I hate it. Night time is the only time we have to spend with each other and our child. It is time that I have planned to be free & empty so we can spend time with our child after fetching him from infant care. Why can’t you leave it empty as well? You have been doing this so frequently that your son has some separation anxiety. Whenever he gets to see you, he would be so happy and not want to leave your arms. At the beginning, you told me that you wish to work hard for the family. But working so hard and missing your child’s milestones? Missing the chance to bond with your child?  He sees you so infrequently that when he grows up, you would only be a stranger that he calls daddy. What is the point? I am very tired with all this.

Things escalated from there and now I’m unable to stop myself. We click very well and i think there’s a big attraction between us.We do keep our personal moments off from the family time. When it comes to her work and household chores she takes care of everything very well. She has never taken advantage of the situation and failed to work properly because of our affair. The problem is i think my mum (staying with us) sensed something recently and ever since she has been insisting on sending our helper back home. She keeps finding fault with her which was not the case in the past. I really don’t want her to be sent back as this is not her fault. She has a family to feed back home and i feel very guilty. But I can’t speak about this to anyone. I can’t even bring myself to ask my friends for advice. I’m also very worried that my mum might say something about this to my husband.

Both of us have a stable income and we don’t spend on luxury items (except gifts on special occasion) but we do spend more on food and travel. Side note is our taste buds and hobby are in sync throughout (Sports and Entertainment) for this whole r/s. Hence money is not an issue for us to start a family.Somewhere in the 1st or 2nd year of relationship she hinted to me on being childless, I thought  it was due to health issues and said I will accept if really can't have. Sorry that I shouldn't have said that easily. As time went by the childless mindset got stronger until the 3rd year of our r/s. We had a deep talk and almost broke off, but we stayed on as she said she would reconsider. So we continued to move on peacefully. The reason for her wanting to be childless is due to the stress of raising a child in SG (worrying the child may grow up bad, born with limited capabilities, raising and guiding). However I reassured her numerous times that we are in this together and she will never be alone.As for intimacies, we do have a good time but we have never had s** as I respect her decision.Moving on to family issues, I am a Malaysian and she's a Singaporean (We are staying apart in SG). Her family has been rejecting of me up till today because I am not a local born Singaporean. I have converted to Singaporean Citizen trying to resolve this but to no avail. Instead, now they call me unfilial (for not taking care of my parents in Malaysia) and traitor (for giving up Malaysian citizenship). I have neither entered her house nor had a meal with her parents since the 1st year of our r/s.As for my family, they're very welcoming of her because she's my 1st GF. It was awkward at first, but they started treating her like DIL very fast. My dad who passed away a few months ago did ask about her many times while I was by his sick bed for almost 2 months.Actually my GF also fought for us to stay together with her parents and both sides don't give way resulting in their limited communication since then. So I do understand the difficulties she's facing with them.Lastly, this blew up again as we're having trouble getting a BTO/SBF while balloting continuously for 2 years and I brought up the about getting a resale / condo (2nd hand) and child.I believe now the final decision is on me to either give up the future child OR her. And of course I foresee that we're probably not getting married until 4 years later (optimistically) for new house. It is very hard to find someone who is this in sync with me.Drop me your decision if you’re me by casting your vote, ""Care = Stay with her"" OR ""Wow = leave her"".Sorry for wasting your time and thank you for your opinion.-#102000: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/102000",46 ,3 ,0,52,0,14,0,0,120,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#101993,2022-02-28,"I don’t know if my boyfriend is becoming a gold digger or if he just doesn’t love me anymore…. We have been dating for 11 months now. Both in our early 30s, working full-time and financially independent. For context our salary are in the same range (4-5k). However, our backgrounds are vastly different. He had a more frugal lifestyle while growing up. This did not matter to me at all as I very well knew that I was fully capable of supporting myself financially.But recently I felt that he isn’t putting in as much effort as I am and it feels like he is becoming a gold digger. We planned to dine at a japanese restaurant for Vday, he knew I was looking forward to it. But he cancelled on me last minute and the reason was he had to console his friend who broke up the day before (guy friend). That was when I realize, I am never his priority. He had to console his friend while abandoning his girlfriend on Valentines? I was pissed and we had a fight. He ended the fight by saying he will make up to me on the 15th. So on 15th we had dinner and exchanged our Vday gifts. Now this is the part where I got really pissed off. Obviously on Vday there should be effort put in from both sides no? I bought him a shirt and necktie from a high-end brand. But guess what he bought me? Just a few normal chocolates and 1 stalk of flower. Not saying he has to get me something expensive from a high-end brand too but at least show me that he had put in the effort to get a better gift, especially when he knew I will be getting something in the mid-range for him. We had agreed on a $100 budget each for our Vday gifts too! Plus it is also not the first time that this happened. For Christmas last year I got him a Secret Lab chair (he kept hinting that he wanted it, saying things like “If only I can get a SL chair for Christmas”. He did not just say say only as afterwards he kept showing me the picture of the chair he wanted). 2 weeks before Christmas, he accidentally went into my inbox and saw the order confirmation mail so he already knew I bought the chair for him. In return he gave me a pair of Nike sneakers. Often I would also buy food and desserts for his family when I went over. But when he comes over to my place, he never once bought anything, at most he only bought 2-3 packets of food when we had dinner on New Year’s Eve. Yesterday, I confronted him about the differences of our spending for each other but he brushed it off by saying he was brought up to be frugal, cannot change one. When I asked him if I should lower the price of my gifts to him to match his, he said no he rather receive expensive gifts than cheap ones that he will not want or use.I don’t know what to do, I still love him but it feels like he don’t bother to put in effort as he enjoys the feeling of just receiving and not giving. But it can’t be only one party giving in a relationship right. I also cannnot understand why is his friend more important than me on Vday. I don’t feel loved by him anymore.

Over the last few years, I find myself getting increasingly irritated by his lack of maturity. We are both 35 now and bro I'm seriously sick of your horrible lack of general knowledge and growing-up.You can't even speak clearly. Your words are always so vague. You run away from commitments. Your mum does everything for you. You get upset with a little bit of criticism. You can't treat your girlfriend right.The time you caused a split in our group bcus you spilled a secret that you were specifically instructed not to tell. What's the deal man?! Is it you want to be hero? The times you twisted a story and made me look bad in front of your parents bcus you didn't want to face the music. The time we went on a double date and your sister called to say your parents are fighting and ignoring each other. You abandoned your gf to rush home. For what?! What can you do even if you go home?! My wife and I feel so sorry for the girl. When we hang out all you know is talk. You talk and talk and talk. I see your gf ordering the food, getting the utensils and sauces and paying the bill. I wanted to smack you on the head man.The time we went to eat Korean bbq and you poured the raw meat over a pile of cooked meat. When our mutual friend nagged at you for it, you couldn't take it. To be honest. You deserved it.The time one of our friends said he is into architecture lego and you burst out laughing insulting that legos are for children. You said the only legos you know are those big bricks for kids. You didn't know there are legos in the shape of worldly landmarks. Isn't that general knowledge?The time you said the bto in clementi is only 100k. I'm not sure what world you are living in. It's OK to not know stuff but instead of brushing up on your general knowledge, you spend all your time reading love novels.The time when I said I needed to buy a bulb because the one at home blew. You said to call and electrician. Not sure this is lack of general knowledge or common sense. I'm guessing your mum does everything for you to the point you never had to take care of anything. You don't even buy your own shaver. Due to your very poor general knowledge  I have to stop every 5 mins in our conversations to explain things to you. I was okay with that in the past but I'm getting tired. You have the general knowledge of a 10 year old. For all the times you blamed everyone instead of yourself. Hey. It's never your problem right? You make reference to Disney characters maybe a quarter of the time. Don't get me wrong. I'm like Disney too. The time your gf had enough of you and broke up with you. You called me and said the girl must have been brainwashed to break up with you. Seriously?? Brainwashed?? I think she had been brainwashed to stay so long with you lol. Instead of looking in the mirror you trash your gf the first chance you got? You cna never be trusted to do anything. You have no sense of responsibility. You have never taken care of anyone or anything. You colleagues are so nice to pick up after you screwed the projects. Most people who have been fired. There is so much more... You need to grow up man. You have lost all your friends. No one wants to talk yo you. No one wants to hang out with you. Your ignorance is just unbelievable. Don't make me leave you too.

#101963,2022-02-28,"I've dated this nice girl for close to 4 years before we broke it off. We were pretty stable at the start. Love was there, finances were of no issue and it was mostly us splitting bills. Were there for each other during our ups and down.Met her parents, she met mine. Family was okay. I even went on multiple trips/holidays with her. One of which was with her family too. Even planned our future together etc. But ever since COVID started, our relationship became really rocky. We started meeting less too. She kept comparing me to guys who can afford things for their gf etc. She occasionally sends me insta pictures of her friends have certain item etc.Like ok, can't you see I'm saving for our future? For a house? So that we can live comfortably instead of splurging on luxury products? She said I've changed and I didn't used to be like this. Are you kidding me? Come on, when we first started dating I was a pretty average person who tried to scrimp whenever I could. You were still there for me, we gave each other support but now when I'm a little financially stable, you suddenly want all these things.Perfume, bags, even a MacBook? Can't you buy these for yourself? I still pretty much gave in to her. Whatever she wanted, I tried my best to deliver it. Gifted her a Chanel handbag because she wanted one for her birthday. And what did you get for my birthday? Nothing. That's right. No dinner, no gifts, nothing but just a congratulatory text message saying I'm older. It felt like for most of the past year I was giving instead of the one receiving. It no longer felt 50-50 but more like 80-20. This is a stark contrast to our first two years together. I'm glad I cut my losses before it's too late. I really don't understand what changed her throughout the years though. Is it the ""don't settle anything for less"" movement? Or maybe I wasn't romantic enough that caused her to be turned off?Guys here should really know their worth. I think there are a few out there possibly in the situation as me. If you are able to do most of the traditional ""manly"" tasks: paying for stuff, fixing up things, driving and on top of that care for your gf, cook for her etc but all she has to offer is the occasional sex and a little love then you really should re-evaluate your relationship.

Even for trivial matters like us occasionally forgetting to close the door, or us taking slightly long to find things that she asks for, she will make a big deal out of it and make loud, hurtful remarks such as “Father and daughter both equally dumb”, “One day if I die, both of you won’t survive, only I know how to run the household here”, “It’s so tiring taking care of your father and you, I just want to check in to old folks home and rest.”It happens every single day, although my dad and I have been trying whatever we can to improve her mood e.g. buy her presents, bring her out to eat good food. We also try our best to help her with housework. But nothing seems to work. Generally, it is very hard to communicate with her, because everything we say to her, she will respond passive aggressively or nitpick about our choice of words. So, nowadays we just keep quiet most of the time to avoid triggering her. Even during meals and when we are outside, she speaks to us in angry tone almost all the time. We really have no idea what is stressing her or making her so upset, it feels like she is just not pleased with my dad and my presence in her life.Could my mum be having some mental health issues? If so, how can I effectively persuade her to get it treated (see a counsellor etc.)? Or is this a common thing for older ladies her age and I just have to bear with it? My dad and I are really stressed having to face her on daily basis, especially now I am home all the time since I still 100% WFH now and I just broke up with my bf recently.-#101938: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101938",33 ,3 ,0,22,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

Today is Valentine’s Day shouldn’t it be the guy do the payment?” I told her there’s no such rule or policy that die die must the guy pay for the meal what. I mean, my boyfriend on the usual days he’s the one paying for every meals that we had together so why can’t I do something special during this occasion? Then she carry on with her nonsense, “Then? No flowers? Where your flower? Ehhh..this kind of guy not good la!” I was really disturb by her KPOness. And I just shut her off by saying “Aunty!

#101935,2022-02-28,"To #101903 #101920 the guy who is s**ually attracted to his sil.Let me share what happened to me. Maybe it will help you to have a clear picture what you can do next. Once my bil caught me breastfeeding my newborn when he and my sister visited me at the hospital. I was exhausted after giving birth and I wasn't expecting visitors at that time so I was unprepared to cover myself up. I believe this was the only time my bil saw me topless.For years I notice my bil leering at me when we visit each others homes. But I chose to ignore it because I trust him as my bil. He would do things like reach for a tissue box across me and have a full arm brush into my chest. Walk past me and swipe his hands across my butt or close into my inner thigh. The actions confused me and I try to brush it off as accidents. Once I had to collect something over at my sis place, I didn't know my bil was alone at home else I wouldn't have gone. When it was just the 2 of us alone in the house he s**ually assaulted me and only stopped when my sis came back. I finally pieced everything together to realise he had actually been molesting me. In short I didn't notice he was attracted to me until the assault. I didn't report him to the police but after revealing what had happened to the family it completely destroyed our families. My my sis chose to believe my bil and accused me of seducing him. The people who are most affected and heartbroken are my parents. They have lost me and my sister at the same time. Cny is suppose to be a happy occasion but it's now laced with sadness for my parents every year because there is no longer a family reunion. I dread the day when my parents pass on and we have to have a funeral. I can stand my sis hating me but I don't want to see my bil again ever.My bil probably started to have similar thoughts like you in the beginning. I'm not saying you will do exactly what my bil did. It's good that you are aware of your thoughts and want to ask for help. Please something about it before something bad happens.Ignoring the troll comments, the helpful ones like telling someone (aka your wife) who can help you to safeguard your thoughts from becoming actions is one of the best answers. If your wife knows, she can help you! Keeping secrets in a marriage is never a good idea. A secret, once exposed, may also dampen the fantasy for good. Give your wife the chance and choice to help you. By not telling her, you are also increasing the distant in your marriage. If it means having your sil move out and your wife explaining or not explaining the reason why, so be it. Facing your wife's reaction now is way better than the uncertainty of what you may do to/with your sil in a moment of weakness. Trust your wife to help you. Tell her!-#101935: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101935",35 ,5 ,0,83,0,170,0,36,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#101934,2022-02-28,"Jus want a place to write. Maybe it will be posted, maybe it would not. But at least I wrote something to let these feeling go off one day.So I had been reading a lot, a lot of fwb these days, these era. I am still in my 30s, and I still have a traditional mindset. So, I met this guy in my previous workplace. He was quite nice to me initially, but the truth is he is a “gentleman” in general. Yes, he treated ladies well. But sometimes he makes me feel that I am exclusive, because whether he was being “put tgt” with another lady in a conversation when I am around, he will make it sound like he prefer me more than that lady. Sometimes it make me feel a sense of comfort, when I know he was jus not the one I should hold on.Long story short, yes I eventually fall for him, bcoz I feel and thought I was someone for him. A few month later, he came clean with me that he is someone who is doesnt want to settle down and wanted jus a fwb. Of coz this broke me, I wanted to distance myself away from him, he came back, we are back in the cycle again. I guess, eventually he really felt that I am too attached to me, or he found someone else (perhaps I really have that insecurity that why I always feel that I am not the only one, though there was a 50-50 chance that I might have overthink) , and then we ended. Really ended without seeing each other for 6mth. Sometimes I still crave for him. sometimes I wish I can be more wild so that I can crave for someone else other than him. And yes I do envy ladies who can let it go easily and jus move on.-#101934: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101934",46 ,3 ,0,3,0,15,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#101933,2022-02-28,"Hi seeking some advice here!  Sometimes I cannot tolerate my bf. We have been together for 1 year plus and he is a working adult, 27 years old, and I have noticed some habits of his that made me rethink our relationship He likes to stay up late till 1-2 am especially during weekends. Sometimes to meet friends and then play cards, game, or watch basketball matches. He does it even if he has work the next day, then he will end up telling me he is feeling very tired, or he would wake up late and then rush to work with a cab. Other days if he has no work, he would then sleep in until 1 or 2 pm and then wake up. I really don’t understand why he does this. I find it so unhealthy to sleep at such a timing, and I question his time management. You know you have to wake up early the next morning, then why not have some self discipline to sleep early and play other times? At least you will feel less tired, able to wake up on time so you don’t need to cab to work.  Also, sleeping in the next day makes half the day gone and then you cannot complete what you want to do for the day, which becomes a vicious cycle where you have to stay up late again to complete the tasks and the cycle repeats. There were also occasions where he woke up late on the day of our date, where we had already arranged a time the day before to meet to go for a meal, but when I reached his house, he was still sleeping because he slept late the day before. Then I was just stupidly waiting for him to wake up, which I felt was a waste of my time. I do understand he has his own life and things he want to do as well, but I don’t really know how to bring up to him that sometimes his sleeping habits is affecting our plans together, and I am fearful that what if this happens when we stay together next time? If he is going to still be sleeping when I am awake and ready for the day’s acitivties, then I guess I would be doing stuff alone in the day while he is still asleep.  Any one has similar experiences and care to share some tips? Thank you!-#101933: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101933",84 ,18 ,0,0,21,35,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#101932,2022-02-28,"Right now is 15th Feb, 1.04am. I have been crying since 10pm 14th Feb. We have been married for 8 years. My husband didn’t wish me Happy Valentine’s Day nor bring me out for a meal and the first thing he talked to me after back from work was that he requested me to bring our son to school tomorrow morning as he needs to be in office tomorrow 8am and followed by my mil’s birthday is coming weekend and the family wants to dine out for celebration. I was silent and didn’t give him any response and continued to prepare the dinner for our son. Then he flared out and saying I didn’t give him a happy face & also response to him. I told him I didn’t expect the first thing he talked to me today after both of us back home from work was this request. It was a Cold War night that we didn’t talk to each other afterward and I went to sleep in the guest room. He complaint that why I still deemed this kind of Valentine’s Day is important while I said I have no expectation from him anymore coz he said he is not a romantic guy. But we were dating and before we have a son, things were not like this. But I’m aware that if you reluctant to do something, you have one thousand of excuses instead of finding ways to do it. I didn’t demand anything from him, but was hoping that he will at least wish me happy Valentine’s Day.  Am I very demanding?? But it didn’t happen at all. I begged him not to quarrel on today as I just want to have a peaceful night. I am a full time working mother and independent most of the time. Sometimes if he’s wfh, sometimes I still need to order grab food for him or bought food for him coz he’s always very busy at work and will not have time to buy lunch. But if if wfh (he’s in office), he whole day also never check if I’m ok or have lunch. Of course this is a small little thing, but is this a sign that I love him and more than he loves me? When I was down with fever and later on tested for covid positive, I still had to drive from office and picked up our son from childcare and settled his dinner. That night he still OT in office and left at 8pm while I told him to go to the clinic to take the referral letter as I was scheduling a specialist visit for our son. I always think that, lady should not be too independent isn’t it? I planned most of the outings, staycation after our son went to bed. But what he did every day is playing games, he said this is to destress. The only time he stopped playing games was he was being retrenched by the company. I think we have reached to the stage whereby we can’t discuss things properly and we don’t have patience for each other’s anymore. Sometimes when he was throwing temper, he would slam the door, throw things like chair and damage some of the things which I hate & can’t tolerate. We did bring up divorce many times due to frequent quarreled but no action done yet. He thinks he has done the best to salvage this marriage. While I think I don’t know how to spend my remaining life with this man but something holding me back is our son. I feel guilty that I can’t give him a complete family if I proceed with the divorce. Sorry to all readers, as this is a sad post which you probably will find this story no head no tails as I’m still tearing when typing this post while my husband is sleeping soundly in the next room.-#101932: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101932",61 ,26 ,0,104,0,47,0,48,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
#101930,2022-02-28,"While people are out there celebrating Valentine's Day with their other half, here I am crying in my own room.I recall that a week ago, she called for a breakup. I could remember that look on her face, full of disappointment. The fact is that there is something I have not done very well in her eyes.We first met in the year 2018. Whenever we went dating, she would treat me to good food and present. Basically she will shower me with the love that I never had before. I dont even have to give her any presents, contrary to what other guys had to do.However, she started to change in the year 2020 (After Circuit Breaker). She has become less easy going, very different from the nice girl I knew. I remember that  when I proposed to have dinner with her at a coffee shop instead of those atas restaurant, she will show me the disappointed look and after the dinner, not even a word of 'thank you' from her.At other times (Once or twice per month), she will be swiping my credit card to buy those Gucci, Prada whatever la handbags. This was done without my permission.Also, there was once where I wanted to treat her to an exquisite birthday dinner at my house. I made my own version of Italian pasta (Using noodles that were about to expire but hey, wastage is bad right??) Buying those real Italian pasta is not cheap anyway.For the exotic wine, I used the one which my friend gifted me a year ago. For the French toast, I used the Gardenia loaves. The idea is to be creative and isnt that what girls like?When she turned up for that dinner, she was extremely livid. She told me that she was very disappointed with the dinner and it was so fake as it didnt even give her the out of the world experience. I told her that having a meal at the restaurant is not cheap but she called me a miser. Through all these incidents, she told me that she had it enough and that I cant bear to part with my money. She didnt use to be like this. I am saving up because money is not easily earned and I am planning for our future. That being said, the relationship ended.Tonight I am crying in my room, not because of sadness. They are tears of joy. In fact I am not alone. I had the companionship of my seemingly endless hundred dollar notes stacked vertically. I was busy counting and kissing my notes from 7pm to 1159pm and I was never this happy before! The thought of the potential savings from getting rid of this white elephant simply puts a smile on my face.To all the fella guys out there, YOU are in control of YOUR finances!

#101917,2022-02-28,"I used to have a fwb I couldn't get over as well, we had been fwbs for a while and I caught feelings for him about a year in. He didn't reciprocate my feelings, and he wasn't looking for commitment.He was actually my roommate's fwb, but things happened and we ended up ""sharing"" him. He was great in bed anyway so it was pretty hard to cover things up. Thin walls.We continued being fwbs for a while after that before he decided we should stop because I was getting too attached. At this point he'd already stopped being fwb with my roommate for about a month as well. This was before uni started for both of us (I've since graduated) and it was really awkward seeing him in school for a few years (thank god for covid I guess?).Im still friends with my ex roomie and found out that she'd asked him to be exclusive as well and that was why he stopped coming arond. He got together with his current gf maybe a couple of years after we split and I spent quite a while wondering why and what could have been.I think it would be better for fwbs who have grown out of the relationship to call it quits ASAP before things get out of hand in the emotional aspect. Things could have gotten messy with me and my roomie but I guess I'm thankful that my fwb made the call to cut it off in the bud. I'm still glad that I had those experiences with him and while I do find myself wondering what ifs quite often with regards to him, I think I've already accepted that we're not a thing.

#101922,2022-02-28,"I'm 38M and am dating a 36F.  I was very attracted to her initially. I thought she was a fun person to be with and she knows how to turn me on. We met through friends who introduced us. She knows how to dress to make me sweat and shows off her best assets so I can overlook some of her flaws. She's on the meaty side and I'm fine with that. I'm in the normal weight range and don't mind being with a larger woman.The thing I cannot stand about her is her constant need to make me do stupid things for her. Like she would ask me to buy things for her late at night. If she's craving water with lemon slices, she would ask me go 24 hour supermarket and get some lemons and if I don't do it, it means I don't love her? Or she would ask me to go 7-11 and get comfort snacks for her late at night. I stay around 30 mins bicycle ride away from her. Both ways will take me more than 1 hour, on top of looking for the items that she want. If I refuse she would argue with me, withhold having sex with me and accuse me of not loving her. Nowadays so easy to order things online, I offered to order for her but she told me she will only feel loved if I personally deliver it. Sometimes I think she is treating me like a free grab food rider. I also start to find that she is quite selfish when it comes to s**. If that day she is unable to climax, she also won't bother to let me have a happy ending. Sometimes I try very hard and long but she's heavy and some postures is not easy to maintain so she will get frustrated with me and stop. I thought women don't need to come everytime? Sometimes I wish I am with a lighter woman.I feel like breaking up with her because I'm starting to get tired of her stupid requests and I start to think we are not s**ually compatible. Talking is useless. The moment I mention, she will accuse me of cheating. I don't want our mutual friends to feel awkward when I break up with her so I am just waiting for the right time to do it. How do I break up with her in the nicest way possible?

#101906,2022-01-29,"My younger brother (15yo) is obsessed with nazis and germany and everything else in between. Basically, it started with the interest with history, and then it evolved into fascination with the wars and now he has the nazi flag as his whatsapp profile picture + joined discord groups that seem to be pro-nazis. It has been 2 years since he told me and initially I thought it was just a phase. He joked about how he knows to differentiate things in the discord, claiming he sees it all as a joke. But being a part of that for 2 years is birderling worrying for me. I mentioned it to my mum, who also said it is a innocent phase, nothing to worry about. But now he is in this angsty, 'cooler than everyone' kinda phase too and things have just gone a bit worse. He told me not to tell anyone, but he is looking to buy weapons. He had always had a fascination with them for years, but never to this extent. Because he took a part time job over the holidays,  he has decided that he wanted to buy real staff/baton/sword/blades kinda thing. I discussed with him the legality of it all and he claimed that since it can be delivered to sg that it is ""allowed"". I told him not to do that but I don't think he will listen. I asked him why he wanted them and he said that he is interested in martial arts. ""Why not take some lessons?"" I asked him, but he says he hadn't saved up enough for them yet and our parents wouldn't want to sponsor. Which baffles me because you don't have enough money to attend lessons that teach you how to handle these weapons safely and so instead of saving up, you decide to buy weapons instead?? He doesnt share these things to anyone and I am worried that if I told my parents, he wouldnt trust me anymore and then nobody in the family would ever know anything. At least now, I can still try my best to guide him since he trusts me... But I am worried. He had been diagnosed with adhd just a few years ago too and so that kinda adds to his impulsiveness...

This is because historically the boss had forbidden my father from taking MCs on Mondays and Fridays and would accuse him of trying to take a long weekend even when he is genuinely sick. The boss kept saying that all the other employees are trying to pull the same trick and I cannot understand what's happening. If he forbids everyone to take leave/MC on Mondays and Fridays, why would he have manpower shortage on those days. If he did not impose this rule uniformly, does that mean he is targeting my father because he is a pushover?Besides that, there were other things too like recently he told my father he had ran out of leaves when my father still had 5 days remaining. My father only started taking note of the days he took leave and that's how he know he should have more days left. Previously he did not and we believe that over the years the boss may have cheated him of many leave days. While my father's weak personality is a big reason for all these, I also feel that blue collar worker tends to put up with more BS from their boss because they may be less aware of their rights/are more afraid to lose their job/more used to being taken advantage of. I told my father that we should follow MOM for all the leave issues and that he should stop working for this company but he wouldn't listen. +-#101895: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101895",17 ,3 ,16,4,0,13,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

#101884,2022-01-29,"Tldr - how do u forgive a relative that brought calamity on your family? (Hope admins post this)With the recent hot topics of 1) husbands being man-childs and 2) visiting others when in close contact with covid positive ppl, I would like to share my story and get everyone's thoughts on what I should do.For context: I live with my parents. My sister, bro-in-law and their son have their own place but live together with us out of convenience. My bro-in-law is nearing 45 years old man. All he does everyday is either sleep/lie on bed after work or play games on his mobile phone. He has never participated in the taking care of his 5 year old son (like an absent parent), never paid for the son's expenses, so of course, he had also not taken care of his in-laws (my parents). In short, he's just another big kid.My bro-in-law recently caught covid, because he works on-site and his colleagues find it a hassle to wear masks. Despite the fact that he got ill and was having a fever/cough/all the symptoms of covid for a few days already, he refused to isolate at his own place and continued staying with his in-laws, refused to see doctors, refused testing and refused medication. He just lie in bed with his mobile games. In the end he ended up infecting his son, his wife, his in-laws, and myself since we are all in the same house.Now, his father-in-law (my dad) is struggling and fighting for his life in ICU because he caught covid from my bro-in-law. My dad has been faithfully staying home, wearing masks, keeping clean and going for jabs. To think that he has to catch covid this way from his ungrateful son-in-law and may just leave us at any point in time is really upsetting.At this point idk what to do. Idk how to tell my bro-in-law to man up and start being responsible, take care of his own health so that he stops infecting ppl, and step up to take care of his own family, like how a 45 years old man should be behaving. He's lucky that my parents have been caring for him and his son all along, but this will no longer be the case with my dad bedridden and my mum old. I also dk how to forgive someone who brought nothing but harm to my family, and it's hard for me to interfere in this because I am younger than him and it's his marriage, but it's also a fact that my dad is in this critical condition thanks to my bro-in-law. I am worried that I might just punch my bro-in-law one fine day. Sometimes I think it's much better to stay single than be in a marriage like this where the husband is nothing but a curse. Is there a hotline that I can call to report people who are covid positive but still goes out infecting everyone? What would you guys do in my situation?-#101884: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101884",35 ,8 ,0,18,0,21,0,24,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

During our last meet to clear the air, you gave the usual “I didn’t mean to lead you on” nonsense statement. But you knew exactly what you were doing. You betrayed what little trust and faith that I had placed in you, which led me to become very wary and skeptical of people in the months after your leaving. I couldn’t trust anybody.

#101880,2022-01-29,"A week ago, my sister tested positive for covid and since then, she has been isolating herself. We share a room but I subsequently moved to my mom’s room. Though there’s only one toilet at home, my mom cleans the toilet frequently. Ever since I told my bf about my sister, he has been avoiding coming over my house. My bf and I have been together for 6 years. He has always been very caring towards me. 5 days ago, I asked him to come over my house to cook dinner with me but he declined, saying he doesn’t want to risk contracting covid and passing the virus to his parents and grandparents who live with him. But I think it probably has nothing to do with his family because he doesn’t interact much with his family. So I don’t think he truly cares about infecting them. Honestly, I think he’s behaving like a useless coward. It’s just a virus, won’t die what. I think it’s perfectly okay for him to come over my house because my mom cleans the house quite regularly. But he said we should wait for a week before seeing each other again. We used to meet up almost everyday but for the past week, he would just place my favourite food and desserts at my door everyday without coming inside my house.And every single day, he would remind me to take the ART test, drink more water and sleep early.  I find him super annoying and hypocritical. If he really loves me, he shouldn’t have acted like a coward right? What’s the point of reminding me to take the test if we’re not gonna meet? What’s the point of placing food at my door everyday when I can order food myself? So a few days ago, I asked one of my guy friends to come over my house. Because I felt quite lonely, we ended up sleeping with each other. My bf happened to see his shoes at the door when he was placing the food at my door and he confronted me about it. We ended up quarrelling and he got very upset at me for bringing a guy home.I really don’t understand why he’s so upset. He chose to not come over my house and because he didn’t want to come over, I got lonely and had to resort to asking someone else to come. So this is all his fault. Yet he still had the audacity to get all upset over this. Worst of all, he said I should apologise for what I did. To be honest, I don’t think I’m wrong. It was just an accident so I don’t really wish to apologise but I also don’t want to lose my bf. We have been together for so long and I do love him a lot.

#101871,2022-01-29,"TLDR: Husband was never present; I found out he has been flirting with other women. Marriage counselling changed him for the better but I find it hard to trust again. I was his first gf. We were together for 3 years before he proposed. Communication wise I felt we were doing okay. I asked to switch departments after we got married because I notice I would get jealous easily when I see him talking to other female colleagues. He has a very honest looking face so ladies also tend to be drawn to him or treat him like a buddy. I was drawn to his kind heart too, that's how we started. So I try to be understanding. I did have the talk with him about boundaries with women and I thought we have an understanding. Then came the children and we decided that I be a sahm. I find him leaving me alone often to do all the parenting. Yes he does help with chores and play with the kids when he is free but I felt that I had married a man child. He gets to have all his me time while I have none of that. When our firstborn was 3 months old he decided to go on his yearly overseas hobby trip. He had spent the year training for it so he did not spend much time with me when I was pregnant too. When I try to plan a holiday trip with my gfs for the first time in 5 years, (I had no break for 5 years) he kicked up a fuss that I couldn't go because my girls trip coincided with him yearly overseas hobby trip and he also need to spend a huge amount of time prior for training. We had no family overseas trip for years because he spent all his annual leave on his hobby overseas trip. He also preferred that I be a sahm so he don't need to juggle his schedule with me because I will have no need for any schedule. I did managed to find a few networks for support and did volunteering but with no support from him because he sees no point that I am not earning anything from all these efforts. I didn't care. I just wanted to do something other than mothering and chores.He spends all his spare time on his hobby. Weekdays he will spend 2 hours on his hobby after work. So I only have less than 2 hours to even talk to him before he gets tired and wants to sleep. Weekends he will spend the whole morning out, come back at noon and exhausted, and sleep until dinner time. I only have a few hours with him during the night. The kids are young so they tend to make too much noise. So he has a disturbed nap which causes him to sleep earlier at night. When we talk about it he will remind me that I said I won't question or intrude into his hobby time before we marry. I didn't know I will feel so lonely and exhausted and frustrated for being so alone in this marriage. He will keep going back to his old ways after a few weeks.He's always with the same group of guys, so I stopped asking who was with him on those trips. This was before covid. I had an overseas trip with my gals while he had his overseas hobby trip in the same year. I thought things between us are fine until I discovered a series of texts between him and another woman. It was highly intimate and inappropriate. I felt like I was reading a conversation between a gf and a bf. He admitted this woman was on his last overseas trip. I can tell their closeness formed after the trip and they had been texting each other daily for months. I'm shocked that he thinks that it's okay to have a female 'best friend' after marriage. From the texts I can tell the woman was madly in love with him. I dug further into his phone and online activity to find out he had actually been flirting with other women (I know some of them). He had been flirty with women behind my back since the birth of our firstborn. So instead of being a present partner in this marriage, he chose to spend the time flirting with women outside and focusing on himself. I've never felt so betrayed my whole life. I felt so shortchanged. Instead of telling me that I'm beautiful, he was telling other women that they're beautiful. Instead of sending me hearts and kisses, he was texting other women hearts and kisses. Instead of talking to me, he was having private conversations with other women as though he's single. The words exchanged are those that he would not dare to say if I were present. That's my biggest problem with him.I wish I never quit my job else I would have left him long ago. I wish I didn't change departments and witness first hand how he interacts with other women. I wish I checked his social media and phone once in a while then maybe I could have had the chance to tell him I do not appreciate his flirtatious behavior behind my back. I wish I cheated on him first since I'm the better looking one in this relationship and didn't have any lack of suitors even when I was his gf. I wish I didn't get married. The marriage I have was not the marriage that I thought would be. I wanted to leave him and I think I almost did. But we went for counselling and things improved dramatically. He radically changed his behavior after that and started to bring me out on dates, buy me flowers, does sweet things for me, surprise me with actions or things. He did the heavy weight parenting tasks that you can think of. Like disciplining the children and following up with the discipline rules. When the children are having a meltdown he took over. Or when he sees me struggling, he will just take over. I know it was also due to his fear of losing me. But who can forget such a betrayal? It was years of deceitful behavior no? Did he do enough to make me feel safe now? Yes.Can I ever forget what happened? No.Very easy for outsiders to say just leave him etc etc.Some days when it's good, I feel good about everything. Some days when he makes me feel less love, I start to doubt everything if it's real or is he hiding and up to something again.-#101871: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101871",32 ,24 ,0,75,0,47,0,48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It took me 30 plus years, many setbacks and many lessons learnt. I was very dull, insecure, angry, lack of confident and always wondering why do others have what I do not. I felt that life was unjust. My friends were rich, their families gave them huge parties, they have the best birthday gifts, best vacations, trendy and nice family.My transition started when I was 16 I found that if I cannot be as good as others in terms of pre existing conditions, I can be different. I indulged into painting and music which calmed me alot and it was enjoyable because it made me escape. Then that was where I found that if you want others to be drawn to you, you have to be drawn to yourself first. When i started enjoying my own life, I was happier with myself, i dont care about what others have or have not, i was happy alone too or if I have company, that is a bonus. When you start to exude positive vibes, the positive things come to you. And, no you cannot fake it. I have seen some people trying to exude "" textbook positive vibes"" and omg it was so fake that they got more negative vibes instead.Just last week, a peer told me she aspires to be in my position in life which I humbly told her that the grass is always greener on the other side. It is true, we have our ups and downs but the key is to be at peace with yourself. Be in love with yourself and the things you have, be kind to yourself, see the beauty in being alone and only when you can completely understand yourself and love yourself then you can encompass other emotions like empathy and love. It is very simple, start from yourself. And it should be an easy process, if you find it hard, you are doing it wrong. Just start again.May you find the beauty in yourself soon.-#101862: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101862",5 ,3 ,0,8,0,73,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

#101857,2022-01-29,"I’m just here to rant about the MOM guidelines regarding paid time off and sick leave for COVID vaccination. Apparently if you’re experiencing side effect the day after taking the shot, you still have to see a doctor to be issued a medical certificate to qualify for paid sick leave.I have an issue in general with the Singaporean workforce’s obsessive culture of getting a written MC to qualify for paid sick leave, but that’s a debate for another time. However particularly in the case of the COVID jab, I feel it is ridiculous for MOM to expect an MC for staff to be granted paid sick leave by their employer.It is a very well documented observation that the following hours after getting the jab, most people will experience a host of common side effects. Even MOH states in their FAQs that “most side effects will resolve within 3 days” including but not limited to “pain, fever, chills, muscle pain, joint pain, tiredness, etc.” So you’re telling me even with that knowledge, you still expect a person to drag themselves to see a doctor to get an MC, rather than trust that they are actually experiencing the established side effects of a drug that the government mandated, no sorry, “strongly encouraged” the population to take? I’m just effing irritated at the brain dead rules that that the ministry set sometimes, really shows how out of touch they are with the situation on ground.

#101855,2022-01-29,"Need to rant. My ex-boyfriend is so cheapskate. Today he suddenly texted me and asked me if I could return him the engagement ring that he proposed to me with. We dated for 4 years before he proposed to me in August last year. A month later, he quit his job because he wanted to start a business with his friends. I then broke up with him as I felt very disappointed with his stupid  start-up dreams. Fortunately I met someone new at my workplace who’s way more mature and financially stable  than him so I managed to quickly move on.So today he told me he would like to sell the engagement ring as he would like to expand his business. I asked him why bother selling this ring as it’s not that expensive anyway. He then said that this ring costs alot to him as he saved up for 2 years to buy it because he knew that it was my dream to own this ring. Playing the sympathy card. Yikes.To be honest this ring is not really super expensive, at most $60k? So I don’t understand why he is so determined to take it back. I am seriously disgusted with how thick-skinned he is, how he tries so hard to convince me to return him the ring. Somemore he already know that it is my dream to own this ring. But when I told my friends about this, they all told me I should return him the ring and support him in his start-up dream and then ask my current boyfriend to buy me a new one. Seriously how to support such stupid dream? So should I return him the ring or not? I have the right to reject him right?-#101855: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101855",607 ,193 ,175,0,162,77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#101848,2022-01-29,"I can’t phrase this issue properly, not because my English is not good, but because there’s no language to properly say this clearly.People in general seem very “nonchalant” about privileges. What I see as a luxury miracle which I need to work hard for, others see it as normal everyday things which they never worked hard for at all. If you observe everyone else, nobody will ask “how do you get so many birthday presents?” “How do you feel so touched until you cry?” Because the majority of the population don’t face this same problem? So that’s why they know everything and never have to work hard? Nobody else needs to be taught how to feel touched by a movie, a marriage proposal, a birthday note, anything! Because these things “come naturally” to them. If you see the word “natural” it means it’s god, or a higher being, putting these privileges in her life, such that she doesn’t have to consciously work hard towards them. But if this higher being, what you call “god”, doesn’t plant love in my life, then shouldn’t i work harder to get the same things as everyone does? I noticed that nobody else has a “way” to get a table of birthday presents or a bag of Polaroids and notes during graduation. They don’t ask; people just naturally give them. Yeah, people just give them.  I also noticed that people who cry at movies “just do”. It’s not because they tried to feel something, it’s a god-given formula, almost like an app that naturally runs in the background. Nobody taught them how to feel it, they “just naturally” shed tears without even trying. How to get as many presents as you can during birthday, and how to get a continuous spam of birthday wishes?

#101841,2022-01-29,"I came into this world with kind intentions in the beginning: I wanted to feel emotions and love like a normal person would. But due to how I'm raised by my parents, all forms of feelings are sucked out of me like a vacuum cleaner. When I was in secondary school, my peers were talking about the movie ""a walk to remember"", and how touching it was and how it made them cry buckets. Curious, I went online that night to watch it on YouTube only to see my mum lurking up behind me, switching off the monitor, and coldly saying"" no need to watch this,understand? Study! It's your topmost priority  now. Can you get hundred in your Maths? Look at your physics. I dunno what you're up to these days, not even studying. You're ruining your future if you don't score. Don't waste time watching stuff like this, study!"" From then on I had no access to movies,so feeling touched by movies was out of the question. My mum supervises my every move like a hawk. She stands behind the screen,scrutinising every webpage. So I thought of another alternative: books. I borrowed some romance books from the library but just as I thought I could understand love from reading them, my mum RAIDED MY BAG and dug them out. Worse, the cold,snide remarks began again,""if only you can use all this energy into your studies. Can't you see that other people score better than you? Focus in your studies and don't read trash!"" From then on, all the books I read are kept within the confines of science,technology,and history. Good for academics but not good for developing the heart. When others are immersing themselves in the touching atmosphere of Novels, movies and songs, I'm trapped in a strict world full of back to back tuition enrichment lessons, ""parent-approved"" books like einsteins discoveries, and classical music(because pop music does nothing to brain development). I soon became a studious robot, knowing only logical stuff but severely missing out on emotions. When other people choose their lunches based on taste&  other emotional factors, I have learnt to be a completely rational and emotionless being: to choose based on vitamin and protein intake. I don't even know what is ""like"" as its not a word in my dictionary. But, there's a complication. I have a high level of intelligence and with that comes the dangerous thing: I learn to ""fake"" emotions to prevent anyone from finding out how inept I am. Yes, I do admit I'm academically smart as i was chosen for a science research Programme and another h3 subject in JC(as I kept studying ) So I learn to perfectly mimic feelings. Although movies and music  make everyone else cry but me, I blend in using cognitive skills. For example, when I hear about a breakup, I nod my head in understanding, saying things like I know how sad it is. Truth be told, as I have never immersed myself in a romance (from movies or otherwise), I'm clueless. But I know that's the ""correct"" thing to say to be a good girl,so I follow the script. When I slipped and had a nasty fall in school,  I saw that many people were looking on in horror at me. I quickly rearranged my facial features into ""pain"", deciphering that it must be the most appropriate expression on my face for a normal person who feels. I proceeded to groan even though I have no idea how ""pain"" must have been for normal people whose emotions aren't blunted. Every attempt to feel emotions like a regular person is thwarted by my parents. Even if I want to go on a class outing, my mum will say,"" can't you see you've so many subjects that didn't get A? Don't waste your time understand?"" Friendship and love are seen as inferior to studies. So repeated incidents like this shaped me into the insensitive, unfeeling beast I am now. Sometimes, my superficial cover drops on accident and people start suspecting I'm a psychopath. When my class was Organising an outing, only a handful turned up;me included). My friend was feeling really upset about it and she couldn't stop complaining about it. I merely listened and nodded but I failed to feel sad about it. Taken aback, she gingerly ventured,""errr....aren't you affected? You don't seem affected at all. "" yes,whoever you are,if you're reading this. I'm not ""affected"" and I know it since young because every time I want to understand how getting emotionally ""affected"" feels like, my ears will burn with callous remarks like ""STUDY! Study! Don't you know that studying is important?"" Relax, I'm not a true psychopath with all senses of the word. I don't inflict harm on anyone, I treat everyone with courtesy, I even donate regularly to charity. I'm not the one who poisons lab mates, I'm not a school bully, I don't flare up at anyone. I have never done bad things. I just don't feel love instinctively in my heart, and I am overly rational.-#101841: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101841",26 ,2 ,0,22,0,22,0,13,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

He insisted on buying us drinks and ordered for 3 glasses of gin and tonic that costs $24 per glass for us and himself. When the drinks had arrived, the waitress asked for the payment for the bill because they are doing the closing for the day. The bill was $130 + which includes the first around of drinks that Alex had promised to pay and second of drinks that Gerald had promised to pay, right?This is the best part. Gerald refused to pay. And then went on and say his card is not working etc. I was like, are you expecting us to pay for your drinks right now? He had the nerve to respond and said “yes, I am not paying”. I have never met anyone as shameless as this dude. The best masterpiece of Mother Earth.  So I went to tell Alex, the first round of drinks should be on him (as promised) and the second round of drinks should be on your friend and right now your friend is refusing to pay for his own drinks. Do you know Alex said? He told me to fxxx off and then he shames me publicly as in I am some kind of girls who can’t pay for their own drinks. Side note: I heard him whispered to the waitress, saying that he would only pay for the “certain types” of drinks. Seem like there is some kind of “agreements” were going on between him and the restaurant. Anyway I am fine if he can’t afford the “happy hours drinks” even though he had promised but the way of him humiliating us is disgusting. After that, I didn’t want to drag the waitress into this mess so I just give out my card and paid for the bill. (Even though there is $74 worth of drinks weren’t ordered by me or my friend). And then we left the place. The intention of this post is to warn y’all on this group of shameless people you might encountered while y’all go to haji lane :)) please do not fall into their trap.

She is humble, and contributes by writing to places like TODAY.Then it all changed when she started dating her first boyfriend. The boyfriend has a totally different belief system from her, has a rather shady reputation, and if said relationship becomes public, I think it is hard for either of them to explain their positionRecently, we had a chat on this and argued really hard because she insisted she knew what she was doing with such a guy (she even called me a pappie) when I simply told her she had a bright career awaiting her medical career, with her works being visible to the public eye and her bosses. She said I was trying to stop her from her happiness, and said his shady reputation was OKBut what I feel is that they will eventually realize they stand for such different things they'll not agree when it comes to important questions in lifeShould I just give up advising her?

#101803,2022-01-29,"Just a rant. My girlfriend  is very insecure lately. We have been together for over 2 years and for the last 6 months we are having multiple arguments over our boundaries. Firstly, she found that I have been following 300+ bikini models on IG and we got into a fight over this. Her basis was that she felt disrespected that i had to follow and like on every bikini photo these models post to validate them. I mentioned that they’re just mindless likes and its not like I would date them or would even have a chance to see them as they’re overseas. She got angrier and said that if I had the chance I probably would jump at them then and I’m being insensitive towards her feelings. She then brought up the issue of not posting photos of her on my IG and ig stories. I told her that I do not enjoy posting my private life on social media so as to reduce my digital footprint plus our friends and family all know about our relationship so this shouldn’t be an issue anyway. She had the guts to then bring up how i wanted to remain private but still openly showing likes to kpop idols and influencers posts on social media, calling me a hypocrite. I personally feel that its two separate issues but now everything feels so messy. Recently she saw that I placed a photo of my fav female idol in my car and she actually got annoyed again because I didn’t have any photos of her/us in my room or car. I told her that I just wanted to look at my bias photo after a tiring work day. She’s now asking me to keep a printed copy of our photo in my wallet now but i really don’t feel like giving in to her demands anymore. I don’t understand why she’s so insecure about our relationship and find the need to nitpick on my social media behaviours and photos I bring along with me. Isn’t it enough that I chose and waited many months for her to be my gf out of the other girls enough to show that I am dedicating myself to this relationship.-#101803: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101803",139 ,70 ,38,0,91,59,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

#101800,2022-01-29,"To confession 101784: I'm going against the grain and suggest you reject what the commentators said to your post. My advice is to communicate first about the issues you're having (he might have some of his own about you, who knows?) and then think if both of you wants the third date. Wanting to date a gentleman with proper manners - this is not princess syndrome. I would label princess syndrome as someone who can't take hardship (or refused to take hardship) and wants everything to be served on a platter. I know I can carry my stuff, I know it's okay to not say 'thank you' or 'please' to the waiter or waitress at the restaurant - it's just whether you got gentleman manners or not. Help, whether it's extended to male or female, helping someone if you can is always a courteous thing to do. And as the saying goes: manners maketh men. I am attracted to a man that has good manners too!My friends and I, regardless of gender, always hold the door if they are the first ones to leave or enter. It's just a basic courtesy extended to your friends. If you're first to enter, then do it for him and maybe he will extend the same to you. But girl, pulling your chair for you is a tad too much. Neither being highly educated nor working in a reputable firm equates to having good speaking language skills. My husband is a chinese malaysian, born and raised there, a high school dropout who speaks perfect english with an accent. He was attending international school prior to his dropout and somehow that accent he picked up from his teachers and classmates stuck with him till adulthood. My husband has no education, works in a small F&B firm doing logistics, doesn't earn much but is able to sustain himself. He is a fucking gentleman in everything he does. He understands social cues, he has tact, he carries himself better than any ivy leagues I have dated and friends I have. Also, he will always open the car door on my side and make sure I am properly seated before settling into his driver's seat. This is where I advise you: do not stereotype. If you want someone with good manners, look beyond the superficial and really get to know someone first. Understanding why they are behaving the way they do is important. You can't tell anything with two dates. In a relationship, people can date for a few years and still don't see each other's true colours. Sad but often true. You can be honest with him that you were raised in a family that preaches about being courteous, having manners and presenting oneself properly which you are able to tell he's not raised similarly as you? Good conversation topic! Communicate more. I am sure he can understand if you want someone with the same values because it seems like you too, are a cultured and mannered lady raised in a traditional family. If he doesn't think he can change or see it as improving himself, then at least you know there isn't a need for a third date. All the best! -#101800: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101800",0 ,1 ,0,0,0,28,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#101799,2022-01-29,"Singaporean living in Washington here.Now that emotions have cooled, just some a thought Id like to share about the COP that happened (in SG), and some parallels I'm seeing in Congress's investigation into the Jan 6 insurrection attempt (anniversary was recent so you can imagine the media coverage).Read my thoughts with a pinch of salt, and I hope some goodwill will be extended to this post as I'm only sharing because I care for my home, and I feel the dangers in the parallels are worth thinking about.First, would be the disagreeing on what is a 'fact'. When the insurrection crowd was gathered last year, all the way to today; there is still broad disagreements on what the crowd gathered ""for"", ""who"" was in the crowd, if it was ""violent"", if it was ""justified"", if they were expressing ""free speech"" (many more disagreements but you get the gist).I think that its absolutely scary, how depending on which political party you support, and what media bubble you belong to, and what ideology you subscribe to; is what set of facts and definitions of facts you believe in. Congress's investigation into Jan 6 has been accused and derailed so many times by calls of politicization and bias; when in truth all they have done is show videos and private conversations on what happened that day. Inescapable evidence; yet many don't see it that way.Its crazy here how vast an ocean exists between one group of people on what is considered factual, and how much it has eroded social life.And its not ""facts"" in the sense that one action could have multiple interpreted meanings.But ""facts"" in the sense of clear evidence showing wrong-doing; yet the parties in-charge and responsible for those violent acts are seen as ""not in charge"", or ""innocent"". Essentially their supporters doing mental gymnastics to twist the evidence or omit (from their minds) certain evidence to continue to see their favorite leader is still innocent and free of blame because of some way or other. If your favorite politician was Trump, then he was innocent. No matter how actually involved and informed he was of the thing that was going bad and brewing for months.I think Singapore (or at least going by the social media posts and FB pages of some prominent and vocal Singaporean pages, and figures both academic and political) arrived at this very moment, and failed this test. Forgive me for sounding harsh, and maybe I might be accused of being away for too long and tone deaf because Im not physically in SG. But its clear that during the COP, groups had already taken sides, and already decided their favorite politicians was innocent even before the first witness approached the stand. This is wrong. I often subconsciously think when seeing how things play out here, think in terms that it will never happen like that in Singapore. That all of us were given better basic education. That as a people we were sharper, and would at least be united in the face of a common wrong, whilst even acknowledging with some maturity and grace that being accountable shouldn't necessarily mean a political death, but an onus to be more responsible going forward.The objective of any investigation into a wrongdoing, shouldn't be for any side to cheer the death of the other, or for any side to breath a sigh of relief they got away with it relatively clean; but to fact find! To decide from those facts what is the conclusion; not to reach one before that based on political allegiance. It become so frustrating to me that the congress investigation despite being fairly objective; memes were being made in support of 'guilty' or interrogated parties when they were being sassy, and is was THIS was was winning the crowd. Imagine my horror when certain COP clips went viral on tiktok doing the exact same. Both are just the same mentally diluting effect on the viewer, in creating a false impression of folksy hero and bravado in the guilty party, when actually they didn't even properly answer the question.For this reason, I did have an icy feelings in my chest, if my beloved Singapore is on the same trajectory as the US, just lagging behind by a few years.just the thoughts of a Singaporean abroad-#101799: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101799",6 ,1 ,0,1,1,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

#101793,2022-01-29,"Just want to rant and wonder if any wifes experienced the same situation I am in or just a norm nowadays. Nothing against husbands as I know some husbands are very good to their wifes which I envy alot. Before marriage and after marriage before having our child, I already know my hubby is an untidy person who have no orders and hygiene level low person. He left food on tables after eating, wrappers, drinks overnight or a few days that invited ants. Before marriage,  I remembered I help him packed his untidy room to have walk space when his parents stayed with him. Nevertheless all housework were done by his mother. After marriage, I took over his mum's job as his parent moved out. Vacuum floor plus mop floor twice per week, scrub toilet bowls scrub walls and floor once a week. All dishes wash and laundry plus throwing rubbish everyday etc. I even do all these throughout my pregnancy and continue till now everyday. The only chore he do is when electronic system breakdown he will fix it.His behaviour got worsen like forgot to bath the whole day and I need to remind him, go toilet poo didn't close door, left poo marks on toilet bowl which I need to scrub, lights were left switched on for toilet, living room, kitchen throughout the night. I am getting pissed off and thinking why I need to live with a person like this who cannot keep up basic hygiene and living standards. Am I asking for too much or this is a norm?He is getting old I know as he is approaching 50 in a few years while I am approaching 35. He might be forgetful somedays I know but it is like 90% of the times? Like seriously,  I bet I reminded him like 100 times. He is busy with works and need to keep thinking ideas and solutions for work but I don't think this is a valid reason if you want to have a family right? I did try to understand him at times and keep quiet and do which is why I am ranting now and not like a few years ago.Ever since our child is born 2 years ago, I felt that he only fulfil his true fatherhood for the very first 1 month. Staying up at night for night feeds, change diapers, make milk etc. I felt so happy at that time. After my confinement, almost everything I took over except for bathing that he is in charge till my child is 1 year old. I felt so tiring to coop with handling all stuffs that is related to my child, do all houseworks, cooking on weekends with houseworks. I am lucky that I am able to wfh for these 2 years and only goes back office once or twice a week which help me save some time on travelling and waking up earlier to prepare for the day. Although my work might not be as busier than his work, I still have deadlines to fulfil and to be complete on time.  Sometimes when I took childcare leaves, I still need to work and take care of the child while he wfh.I talked to him multiple times on this. He said just leave the dishes at the basin he will wash later. But the later never come and I cant accept dirty dishes left at basin overnight and I also need to wash my child milk bottles before I sleep with dirty dishes at the basin. End up I still do all washing. He don't seem to appreciate much at all and think this is my duty. He mentioned something like this is woman duty previously that pissed me off a few days. Am I a wife or maid? To him, driving the child to school and drive us out on weekends is one of the housework he had contributed.  What pissed me off is that his whole day routine is wake up, watch Netflix,  play games, wfh/ go back office , eat, bath , back to play games , watch Netflix and sleep. He will play with our child probably one to two hour per day (break into 2 to 3 sessions). Most of the time he will at the masterroom on his own personal relax time watching Netflix and play games (approx 6 hrs per day at least). I will have to on TV for my child to watch while I do the daily routine works. I will be the one go buy food/cook food most of the time for him and my child, feed my child, clean up wash dishes, do laundry , pack up the mess my child had done then bath my child and make milk for my child before I bath and have my rest at 11.30pm everyday. Somedays I just wake up thinking can I have a day break from all these?As a result, my temper become worse. Somedays I get so annoyed with my child who refused to eat or do something made me angry, I will slap her hands and legs and scold F words. I am not like that last time before I have kid. I get irritated easily now and I lost control sometimes. Even my hubby said my character changed to bad temper. I am more pissed hearing that as he is the one not helping and only do the saying most of the times. I wish he change role with me somedays to let him experience how I feel.Thank you for reading my long ranting post.-#101793: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101793",76 ,38 ,0,55,0,34,0,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

If I were to switch gender maybe I will have a better luck.It is depressing when you look at the tuition assignments page and you see most of them asing for ""female tutor"". I find that there is virually no value in being a male.Then women treat you like you are a sicko just because you are male. I experimented with cross dressing. I went out and about. I noticed women did not treat me the same way. They had close proximity and did not keep much distance. That same day I dressed out, I went to a restaurant and the waiter pulled out a seat for me. When the day was done I made my way home tired. A man offered me his seat. Now I realise that my life is miserable because I am male.Sometimes now I just feel like telling my wife that I want to switch over to being a female because being a male is not that attractive anymore to me. It is depressing. You can say hi to a kid and people will think you have a motive. When I was dressed out I remember saying hi and the parent asked the kid to say hi to ""jie jie"". What a difference.I thought about why men are the ones comiting crimes. Maybe I understand. You just feel that you are a sicko just because you are branded at birth male. Men are not engaged by the society much. They are given shitty jobs. The good ones are reserved for women. The law also view a man as a prospective sex criminal if he is accused. When I am in the train and a female moves her butt towards me without seeing or sensing if anyone is behind her, I am the one who have to jump out of her way so that I dont get accused. Being a man I have to be sensitive to my surroundings. It adds extra stress in the brain. I remember how easy it was when I dressed out. Men gave me way! I didnt have to care much! Then you read everyday of how women slam men in a lot of sitiations. I have no more strength. Might as well give up and join them and be a woman. If you cant win them then join them is a phrase right?Maybe one day my wife wakes up she wont see me at home.

Even during covid she didn't stop shopping.

She went on to pursue a degree while I decided to go to polytechnic. Over time I find she has started to invest less in the friendship. I started working earlier than her so I thought she may be uncomfortable with the difference in our financial status. We still do the same kind of outing activities, still go to affordable restaurants and visit the same clothing shops that we like. I do visit pricier places and start to buy some branded stuff, just not when I'm with her. I know she's very sensitive and tends to magnify small issues so I try to be as neutral as possible in order not to upset her.Little things like her armpit color is different etc. Or her left feet has a darker slipper mark then her right feet. Things that NO ONE cares or notice, she will make a big deal out of it and stress over fixing it. I never understood her need to keep talking about getting fat while eating. Why can't we just enjoy our food? She can't even walk into a restaurant and look for me, even knowing I'm inside because she finds it embarrassing to walk around a restaurant and looking for someone, should I not be there. Then either I have to make sure we walk in together or I wait for her outside or I leave my seat and head out and get her etc.  After she graduated she asked me to accompany her to an interview for her dream job. I went with her, then I ended up getting the job instead of her. She tried again a few more times but she was rejected. She eventually settled for a desk job. I stupidedly thought things will be back to normal. But it didn't. We got married around the same time. I purchased a condo with my spouse while she got a HDB. I think things between us started to go downhill after that. Somehow I keep having the feeling she's bitter that I'm doing a bit better than her while I studied lesser. She always emphasized on getting a degree for a better life. I choose going to a polytechnic at that time because tbh, I'm not the studious type and my family situation and finances didn't allow me to. The end of our friendship came when I told her I was pregnant. We were supposed to meet and she stood me up at the very last minute. I was already waiting at the restaurant so I ate alone. Thinking back I wondered was she trying to conceive and somehow maybe she felt I beat her to it again. Not once did I try to compete with her but she gave me the vibes that she was unhappy with me. She literally ignored me all the way after that. She didn't acknowledge the birth of my child or my birthday or any form of holidays after that. I tried to continue sending her Xmas, new year, birthday greetings for another two years (which she ignored) till I gave up and just decided to forget it. I was upset with her for a while. A few times I felt like confronting her because I have no idea what had changed. I try to think of her as a loser who's insecure and paranoid and I want to assume that she has grown jealous of me. Then I think maybe she has some bigger problems in her own life, health or family that has got nothing to do with me. I also wonder have I offended her in anyway. Out of the number of friends who have just grown apart, she is the only one I wanted to have some form of closure with but will never be able to. I feel I will never really know why even if I ask. I can only guess.-#101783: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101783",13 ,2 ,0,16,0,12,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

When I was busy dating jerks, looking for Mr Right, you're actually right in front of me all this while. I still can't believe destiny has played a cruel game with me. I really believed you are falling for me, like how I have fallen for you when your wife suddenly break up our friendship. If she is so insecure, your marriage must not be going well. Else why would she be intimidated by me? Did you have feelings for me?I try to date more to forget you. But all these boys can't even compare to you. They only want to sleep with me while you make me feel so valued and heard. Not once did you try to take advantage of me unlike those boys. How can I not fall for you? Your wife don't deserve you. I admit I'm envious of how you take care of her when she don't deserve it. I don't understand why you need to do her chores and do grocery shopping after work when she's at home. Knowing what you do for her makes me want you more. Why did you ignore me that day? Why did you throw away my gift to you? Did your wife tell you to hurt me? I planned that for weeks and waited for the chance to put it on your seat. Why did you not come to me when you knew it was me? I admit I fear rejection from you. I want to give up but my heart just can't move on.I know I will get slammed for loving a married man but I have no one to turn to anymore. My friends want me to move on and no one wants to hear me talk about you again.I know you did the right thing. You didn't want me. Doesn't mean that I cannot wish that you did.

In the first two years, I was obsessed with his past relationships and was always fighting with my family (My family is very verbally abusive and critical of me). He encouraged me to move out of my family home.In our third year, I started living alone in a studio apartment. I worked from home permanently and was often depressed and bored. I turned to him as my emotional crutch all the time.He put in a lot of effort in the RS - home-cooked food on valentine's day, took urgent leave when I had an accident, showering me with a lot of gifts and did things for my family. It was my first RS, hence my expectations were high. At the end of the RS, he said that I made zero effort.We also had several disagreements. We wanted to move in together and I insisted we moved in to a studio apartment because of the price point, but he didn't want that. He told me he did not want to have kids but I managed to convinced him otherwise.He reached his breaking point recently with me and asked me to give him space to work on himself. He said he will reach out to me again and told me not to wait for him. Over CNY, I felt so lonely. I sent him a lot of texts and he finally told me to not text him anymore.I have moved back to my parents home and changed my job. As a result, my mental state has since improved. But I regret the person I was when we were together. I feel I have screwed up what could have been a beautiful relationship.I want to tell him that this break-up has changed me.

I realised that whenever I share something, something I experienced or like a story I read online, she will make it about herself. For example, I was talking about this youtuber who I felt for because they were my age and was diagnosed with cancer. Her immediate response was: ""that's why I helped my sis in law when she was diagnosed. It was such a hard time for us because she was so young.......""It doesn't seem significant, but if it is every topic I bring up, I can't help but feel irritated. What's worse is when I am having a hard time and just need consoling, instead, she'll bring up something similar she experienced. And then she'll start crying and I have to comfort her instead because her troubles are ""worse"" than mine. I understand that some people do this because that's how they converse. They continue convos by relating it to themselves. And most times, they are trying to provide comfort when they bring up their own experiences. But now that I noticed it, it is so glaring to me. I feel like I don't want to share anything anymore because she'll make it about her. Or like I end up leaving a conversation feeling horrible. I can be talking about the plot of a kdrama I watched and then she'd interrupt and talk about that time my father cheated and the details that she had already shared with me multiple times before and then break down into tears in the middle of the cafe.

But as the time went on, I'm feeling something towards her. It has come to a point that even at the graduation party, everyone there is asking us to sit together and take photos, but I get so shy and it is pretty apparent to the others around. Even when it's got nothing to do with me at times, such as another guy (ft) in the same dept as me trying to get closer to her, I start to feel unhappy too. Not trying to blame her, but initially she was the one texting me and talking to me, whether it be school or work stuff, to listening to my problems at work. I try to do the same and ask her questions, only for her to give simple replies and move on. I felt quite led on back then, where an example was when I got COVID and she asked why I didn't tell her even though we were in the same dept, and that she would be worried.Things have been pretty dry recently, when I found out that she usually only replies me when it's her work day and dosent save my number.

So...assuming he has a reason to ghost you, can you handle the truth?I'm female and was on dating apps. Met plenty of interesting people and had my fair share of stinks (Literally. Read on.) Ghosted people and I got ghosted on. It can be puzzling and disappointing, but hey we are all entitled to our choice. Sometimes, you just ain't his cup of tea. Sometimes you are the unfortunate side chick who didn't know better.  Could he have done it better? Maybe. Back to the question, so if you want him to tell you the real reason, can you handle it? Or would you heap hate on him after that for being ungentlemanly and being too truthful and hurt your fragile feelings? Do you prefer he tells you white lies so that you get to walk away with your ego intact (it's all me, it ain't you kinda lame BS..)?I ghosted this guy after many dates and I thought we were going somewhere. When we dated, it was all dinner and drinks and the likes in air- conditioned places.  Nothing sweaty and vigorous. Then trouble starts when it's sexy time.I swear on my mama's name I've never felt so disgusted post-coital. He has such bad BO when he sweats he left my bathrobe, hair, and bedsheets smelling like a dead goat. I'm not exaggerating and it left me so disgusted I decided to go off dating apps. I blocked him as well. He found me on other platforms and asked why I ghosted him. I didn't have the heart to tell him he sucked in bed and he almost made me wanna burn my sheets and robe just to get rid of the revolting smell. But neither do I feel like making up some ""it's me, not you"" excuse to make him feel good.

I thought I had only seen such stuff in medical text books. When fully er**t, it was a tiny misshapen and crooked little thing that is barely 3inch????‍.

#101762,2022-01-29,"Both my parents recently retired after successful careers with enough savings to support our household and fund their retirement, even though they never went to university. I just graduated from NUS, am working in a good job, and right now have become the highest earning person at home. I understand the need to contribute back to the household. But my parents have this unhealthy habit of spending for their siblings who are toxic relatives and don't like me and my siblings; and there is a lot of jealousy on both sides of their extended families because among the cousins, only my parents' children have made it to uni, and I'm the first graduate with an FCH, even though I am one of the youngest cousins. Over the years, I have seen my parents' siblings make use of them because they are the most financially well-off amongst my aunts and uncles, and I dislike that they still continue giving in to their siblings. But these siblings are not actually in any real financial distress. At times at large gatherings, it feels like only my two parents are actually trying to keep the ties between their siblings alive, and are the only ones who still talk to everyone. But I digress.I have volunteered to contribute directly to household expenses, and to help support my siblings' education, which I am doing. However, I have refused to give cold cash to my parents because they spend it on their siblings, which they still do from their savings. Today my father told me that this is disrespectful that I am controlling of how they should spend ""their"" money (aka my contributions) and that I am being unkind to those relatives. He also pointed out that it's not like I can't afford it since I also spend for my girlfriend. I disagree because for one, I am still contributing to the household and two, even in the current way I do things, they now have extra cash of their own to spend on their siblings because I have taken on some of their expenses which they used to incur for my siblings, and I can't do anything to stop them even though I disapprove.It is a simple matter of principle for me, that I am not happy to have my hard work go towards funding unkind, jealous people. I believe I have discharged my filial duties fairly, and will continue to increase my contributions as my career advances. But I refuse to let them have free money for as long as they keep up their habit. Should I be feeling in the wrong in any way? Some may say I'm just being petty, that it is just an issue of optics since said toxic people are probably getting extra now that I pay for my siblings anyways. And that's precisely the point, that I'm making a statement that my obligations are limited to my immediate family, which is my birth household and significant other, whom I hope to marry when we're both more established in our careers.

#101761,2022-01-29,"My ex cheated on me 3 years ago and it left me really heartbroken. We had dated for 2+ years and already discussing about marriage and BTO when it happened. Long story short, I found out that he had been using dating apps and sleeping around. Forgave him once, but he cheated again shortly after and so we broke up. Fast forward to today, he is happily married to one of the girls he used to cheat on me with and they just had a newborn. I can’t help but feel so bitter seeing their happy family pictures on IG. I keep thinking, why is life so unfair? He can easily find his happiness after betraying me, yet here I am still struggling to recover from the pain he inflicted on me years ago. Back then, due to his promiscuous habits, I even caught STD from him which I suffered in silence. Until today, thinking of his betrayal still gave me anxiety, and I occasionally still have nightmares of seeing him being intimate with other girls.Since the breakup, I’ve been trying to meet new people, but it’s so hard for me trust guys after that terrible experience with him. Every time I get close to someone, I will start doubting if they are sincere, if they keep secrets from me or are seeing anyone else behind my back.

She was using dating apps like tinder without him knowing and even set dates and timings with other guys to go out with them though she claimed they were never going to meet.This isn't her first time cheating though. She was previously cheating on her ex bfs as well and she was on rent-a-date apps while dating her exes.I feel sorry for him because he treats her so well. For her birthday he literally did so much for her - booked two of the best and most expensive hotel staycays here, spent so much time and effort on the gifts, prepping the room as if it was like a proposal. Not only that, he showers her with so many gifts every other week and they only dine at expensive Michelin star restaurants with lobsters and crabs for every meal. In return all she does is cheat on him countless times with other guys and doesn't even appreciate him at all.When he found out about her infidelity they initially broke up but within a few days they got back together because he loves her so much, and she posted a public apology on it, after talking shit about him just days ago. However looking at the track record it doesn't seem like she'll change. She doesn't even seem sorry and she's probably doing all this to get back the opulent lifestyle she had with him.If you guys think that this is her usual lifestyle, she normally only eats regular eateries and has had to borrow money from her friends in the past to sustain her lifestyle. She's most likely a gold digger who leeches on to rich guys like him until she drains them dry and them moves on to her next target (most of her exes were rich guys).

#101745,2022-01-29,"I am married twice and I have learnt so much about maintaining a marriage from a woman's POV. 1st marriage, I was young and over zealous about being a good wife and living a good marriage. We were a horrible match, but I believed I could make it work. There was always a need to prove to everyone that I made the right choice. I did everything that social media would deem as the perfect woman - including cook, clean, work, bring home money, plan, love his family, do home improvement projects, romance the husband, keep up with the s** and whatever you can think of. Eventually I got burnt out and he took me for granted. Can I blame him? Yes but I am also to blame because I made him into who he is. He hated my guts because I was so good. He criticised me because he hated the compliments I got. He hated it when I see his friends because I stole his limelight. He didn't need to do anything because his wife could do everything. In my POV, I was just trying to be the best for him but in his POV, I was putting him down in every way. So like most marriage tragedies, he cheated on me with a woman who was so ordinary, so ordinary that it opened my eyes completely. I had been working blindly to become what I thought is a good woman - but was it for him? Or was it just for my own ego? I went through a phase of blaming and hating on him because I was self righteous about being the best - and yet I was hurt so badly. But now I am thankful because that failed marriage has taught me so much.My current marriage made me realise that if you meet the right person, you don't even need to try so hard or work so hard. We know each other's strengths and we give each other space. Of course we have days when we are just pissed at each other but we choose our battles. I have the brains and he has the muscles so I do most of family and kids planning while he does the physical labor like cleaning and fixing. He will play his games and watch his sports but still be responsible for the chores at home. I go out partying with my girlfriends but still return home to be a good partner the next day. We respect each other's activities and hobbies. We are always verbal about our appreciation for one another. It is harmonious and great for the kids because I see them growing up being good people. The biggest lesson I learnt is that - if you have issues with a man before marriage, don't marry him, wait for the one who makes you feel good about yourself and brings out the best of you. The right man will not hurt you and will appreciate you for what you have. It will hurt him to hurt you. You don't have to try to make things work, it will just work.

But I'm ok if he goes out with friends (good mix of guys and girls) and its ok for him to go out with his exes or old crushes as long as there is a third party, since I have more guy friends than girls and I tend to go with like a whole group of guys often. At the start, it wasn't so smooth sailing. There will be 2-3 days every month that I will be crying because he said something wrong, affected me badly and I said something nasty in return. He said this is his first serious relationship and he didn't know how to coax a girl. He would only buy me gifts after I say sorry to him, for example. Moreover, before we started to date, I was trying to slim down due to health issues. We do have a bit of weight difference and he is slightly slimmer than I am. So most of the time he will be telling others that I am obese and is not taking care of my health and all sorts of things. People around us could see I'm making effort and was losing weight faster although the changes weren't big. He compared me to different colleagues and keeps thinking I am lazy.The whole relationship truly started to go downhill and he went out with his crush (one of his ex-colleagues) alone, while lying to me that he was going out with a whole bunch of them. I told him off. But then it got worst when he was going out with her legit every week. He treated her to movies, have ""dates"" like other couples too. I voiced out my concerns but he kept saying that I was overthinking things - that I am just purely jealous that she has a better body and personality than I do. What he said brought out all of my anxieties and we argued. I left him alone that night after we ended our shift. He started to tell others he wanted to coax me but I didn't give him the ""face"", so he blocked me on messaging and calls. He also said since everyone is siding me, it's ok for him to be the bad guy. So it seems he just believes I am overthinking or oversensitive about things. It makes me feel as if I am the third party of his relationship with his ex-crush. Looking back, is it my fault?-#101736: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101736",29 ,2 ,0,7,0,10,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#101735,2022-01-29,"tldr; architects need to be paid more for the work they doI believe that many have seen the recent reports of young lawyers leaving the industry, and I would like to shed some light about my own profession that is similarly toxic in so many ways. I have chosen to post here cos there aren’t many (neutral) avenues of speech that can allow this post to potentially garner as much attention, so please bear with me, and may this also serve as a source of information to students who are still pursuing architecture in NUS, or for the younger ones who are thinking of doing so.The architectural profession is toxic to the core, and I would think that many have heard of the insane working hours that architects endure for a ridiculous per-hour pay rate. The starting pay for grads from architecture school (with a Master’s degree and after 5 years of slogging, by the way), has not increased from 10 years ago. It’s like inflation doesn’t exist. Our job scope is unforgiving, and trust me, those working hours actually are required for us to really get the work done. A very simple break down of our work is something like this:—-A PROJECTDesign Stage: design the thing, go through rounds and rounds of reviews with the client, client decides to change the brief on one day’s notice, redesign to comply with the regulations from URA, BCA, FSSD, NParks, NEA, PUB, LTA etc, then rush out plans, sections, elevations & 3d renderings and a whole deck of presentation slides in 24 hours; while doing so, deal with super slow office computers that aren’t equipped with the necessary specs to handle modern softwares because the boss decided to cheap out on themAuthorities’ Clearances: coordinate among your entire consultants team (engineers, acoustic consultants, traffic consultants, landscape architect, quantity surveyor, environmental scientists…etc), and make submissions to each stat board for approval. receive many written directions from the various departments; some take forever to reply and the officers don’t pick up the phone and don’t reply emails. redesign to address these directions.Tender Stage: draw and draw and draw (on CAD softwares, not by hand thank goodness) because somehow many offices do not have draftsmen/draftswomen anymore. client decides to further improve the design, so redesign & redraw. also be chasing the entire consultants’ team for their own drawings, so that you don’t end up diverting pipes in strange directions because the m&e engineer didn’t realize that there’s a beam up there (yes, that’s also our job). then actually prepare for contractors to attach a price tag to your workConstruction Stage: the design is gonna be built! but oh no, the tender drawings were not properly coordinated (because it was impossible, honestly), so there are going to be 100 contractual variations to the design over the next few months. redesign to comply (again), go for site meetings to tell off the contractors for not following your drawings, be really tired from walking in the sun on ground that is not paved (and risk falling into a pothole) while having to actually use your entire brainPost-Construction Stage: defects, maintenance……..blah blah blah—-I’m tired even from typing out all of the above, but yes we get paid peanuts for doing ALL of that. Most architects I know have more than 1 project on their plate at once, more often than not these projects are at different stages. Hence it is not uncommon for a single person to be working on ALL of that at once. How then can anyone afford to only work for 8 hours a day?! Anyone in the design field would also understand how it feels to handle softwares that crash often due to the scale of the drawings, and that in itself is also many working hours gone. You may find it ridiculous that some architects/architectural students wear their long working hours like a badge, but the industry is so toxic to the point that the more you work, the more you can get done before the (often ridiculous) deadlines and the better your work will be. I’ve had bosses who scheduled meetings at 9am on saturday morning and made an entire project team go back to office on National Day (with no compensation) because they would rather do so than to tell the client that the deadline was unrealistic. I’ve also stayed in the office for more than 24h straight just to meet deadlines. I was depressed, very sleep deprived and extremely demoralised at the thought of having to work like this for the rest of my life. Architecture school prepared me for none of the above, and many architects i’ve spoken to would agree that our education was really quite pointless. We learn many things on the job just because of the nature of it; building projects are massive, and it is not possible to learn to handle things on your own until you step into the workforce and learn from an actual supervisor. Even after 5 years in architecture school, a practicing license still has to be obtained for us to be a Qualified Person (QP) which requires minimally 2 years of practice, a written exam (that consists construction law, contracts, the architect’s act, SOP act, all the building regulations from every department i.e. LTA PUB URA FSSD NEA NParks younametherest etc) and an interview. And truth is, it is rare for anyone to be a QP after just 2 years of practice. Many do not get their license at all throughout their career, and most who wish to pursue it only get their licenses between 4 to 8 years from the day they started work.One of my biggest regrets in life is not leaving architecture school when I actually considered it. It all started with a keen interest in design in general, but who knew that things would turn out this way? Information was never this accessible back then, and the industry is too small for word to really get around. You may think that it is not too late for me to leave now, but trust me, it really is not easy trying to pick up other skills while trying to make ends meet (I tried). I have little free time outside of work, and I have bills to pay. Anyone I speak to about my job looks at me in dismay, and yes, I feel appalled at what I tell them too. But that is the reality of what we do. Our jobs as architects is highly stressful, because a large number of lives can be on the line if we do not do our jobs well. Yet it gets more and more unrewarding as the years go by, especially since Singapore was never a great place to get creative to begin with (we really have a lot of regulations, even for small houses). Many of us chose to stay in this line of work, thinking that things will change over time, but it has been years and things have honestly only gotten worse. Our pay is ridiculously low for the amount of work we do, and I believe that a large part of this can be attributed to the architectural fees getting lower and lower over the years, since companies lowball to get jobs. Many of my younger colleagues are thinking of jumping to other industries, and I don’t even blame them.

#101728,2022-01-29,"To OP of #101442, I also had a very long crush on Prof Ben, and one of the things I did to move on was to write a novella involving me and him. In my story, in addition to his NUS career Prof Ben also lives an alternate life as the Prince of White Hat Hackers, going after black hats like a vigilante. One day, Prof Ben meets his match against the twin brothers Shik Shio and Shiok Sha (Japanese for ""f--- this sh*t!"" and ""f--- yeah!""), who defeats him in an intense online duel and robs him of all the cryptocurrency which he invested in with his family fortune. Prof Ben loses his hacking skills from the shock, resigns from NUS and disappears.Distraught by the resignation, I recalled Prof Ben's lecture notes and used the knowledge to track him down. With the help of my F cups, I encouraged him to get back on his feet and regain his skills. In an epic climax, he faced off against the Japanese brothers in a rematch and avenged his defeat. In the ensuing elation, he takes me - in his bed and thereafter as his bride. We went on to have 2 kids and lived happily ever after.This is all just fiction of course, but it was a very effective form of therapy for me.
