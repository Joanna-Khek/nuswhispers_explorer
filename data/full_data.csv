#99069,17/5/2020,"OK someone needs to start holding the university/administration/governments accountable. WHY. ARE. WE. STILL. PAYING. FULL SCHOOL FEES. WHEN WE ARE NOT IN SCHOOL PHYSICALLY?????? That money should back to us for rebates as the household utilities have increased. WHY. IS. NO. MP. DOING. ANYTHING. cc: CHAN CHUN SING. At the bare minimum, we should not have to pay misc. fees, exam fees. They dont have to switch on the aircon/lights, they dont need to do so much maintenance/ cleaning staff. These should be backdated(Mar 2019) and paid to the students or a rebate should be given for subsequent sememsters. If there is already a change.org please link it down below. Where are the student unions? Where are the 5-figure executives who are in-charge of student 'welfare'?

#99067,17/5/2020,Hi guys I'm in a dilemma now.  So my bad and grandpa both got me a phone at the same time. And idk what to do with the both of them.  Let me explain. My boyfriend got me a Samsung S21 without me knowing.  He ordered it weeks before as he knew sooner or later my phone was going to break(which it eventually did). He also got an expensive screen protector and an otterbox phone cover. Was suppose to collect it from him in the next few days. He said it was an early birthday present. Fast forward to a few days later...my grandpa came ovee to my hse. He overheard my parents conversation.  They were talking about me breaking the spare phone screen.  The next day he bought a Samsung S21+ with a leather cover($78) with other accessories. He told me about it after he bought the phone. He said it was an early birthday present. So now idk what to do.  Use one and keep the other as spare(use and keep which one?)?  Or use one and sell the other? Or any other ideas? I don't really support the idea of selling items which were given to you as gift but I'm open to listen to your opinions. I really don't want to hurt both parties.  What would you do if u were in my shoes? Thanks for reading.-#99067: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99067,27,4,0,0,5,6,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Many times it’s the action of close ones that cause the depression. It could be as simple as a slap or even usual parent scolding (or nagging to some) that cause them not to feel loved and feel that they are a burden to the family/society. It could just be embarrassment from you sharing a personal incident from their life to your friends and relative and betrayed their trust.Tdlr: Many times its not so much about them reaching out but what you should have done to show more care and concern and just to respect their wishes instead of brushing them off.

#99063,17/5/2020,"“Eyyyy BRO”The fist bumps, bear hugs and back thumps are quickly exchanged as we took each other in. Jibes and cheers resounded as fingers pointed at each other’s dapper new outfits. Hell yeah, everyone is looking hella fly, and packing the confidence to roll with it. Last minute ice bags were procured from 7-11, and we were imbibing ourselves on the cheap liquor soft drink mix. Sporadic screams would sound out every time a new girl joined a group, or when familiar faces identified each other. Everyone was here to have a good time, and the mood was one of excitement, cheer and anticipation.The time read 11pm on my fake rolex, and the Red Berets had just left after clearing the bridge that we are now once again gathered on. The groups of men took in the sight of scantily clad females, while the females checked out the overdressed men with similar intent. Tongues wagged as rival groups of girls critiqued the clothing choices of their competitors, while the men sized each other up. “Hell yeah, I bet we can take them, no sweat. Just look at them, and look at how many of us there are.”The testosterone steadily rose as the men increasingly intoxicated themselves while talking about how they could beat up the other groups of men and impress all the girls, all while the increasingly inebriated ladies laughed louder and more obnoxiously in a misguided attempt to express their happiness and willingness to ‘fuck the world and all the judgement coming their way’. The happy partiers got exponentially clamorous, while the rest chugged away. A few concerned frowns and shared knowing looks were exchanged between the ones designated to take care of the rest. The designated drivers shared similar resigned nods with their fellow responsibility laden caretakers.Cigarettes were shared, and even those that previously swore off smoke would puff away. Girls would gung ho try a cigarette and cough, to the laughter of the rest present. Inhibitions were lowered, and the reservations anyone had would quickly be stripped away as the hour wore on.The plastic cups and styrofoam receptacles drained fast amongst the men, and the bottles were quickly empty. The ladies would offer up their leftovers, and some mixed groups would quickly form, as an initial contact quickly enveloped the entire group to become a huge group of ‘friends all here to have fun together’. Those looking for a warm body would quickly pair up, and be lost within their own conversations, while the rest would curse their friends at dragging them into a group and leaving them with the unattractive leftovers. Some scrambled to hide their left over liquor, in the futile belief that they would return to their stash if they felt dry, but the exodus was apparent. Groups left one after the other, all determined to convene before the witching hour. The men; some strutted, some slung their arms around each other’s shoulders as they made their way over. The ladies; their arms entwined each other by the waist, linked arms, or simply held onto each other’s hands as they pulled each other through the crowd. Goddamn, the drinks were really kicking in as I felt my brain floating, and a stupid smile slowly creep over my face. The euphoria felt great, and for the briefest of moments, all was right in the world.Lines would form outside the most popular haunts, as everyone claimed to be friends of friends with a guest list, flaunt their black cards with free access, or grudgingly cough up the entrance fee. My friend laughed as I pointed out the fact that only ugly girls had to pay for entry. That stupid statement was inherently true, as gaggles of girls were ushered past the queuing men, laughing and giggling all whilst the men drank in the spectacle and set their sights. “So we ugly girls?” The men were all paying up as we hollered at the joke amongst ourselves.“Well, if you ain’t paying, then you are the product, man.”2 free drinks, the coupon read as I stuffed it into my back pocket. One last check for all my valuables as I gave myself a pat down, and we visually affirmed each other’s presence. The adrenaline rose to a crescendo as I stepped forward to the curtains separating the baggage area from the floor. The dull thump of the bass accentuated our bodies as we started feeling the music pervade our senses.  Midnight, just in time.Here we go. I grabbed the curtains and pulled it open, and with a flourish, we entered. The dark lighting and mass of bodies made it all the more packed, as the loud music forced intimacy amongst communicating persons. The music got steadily louder as we made our way over to the podium. The music was great, and the crowd was willing. We swayed, we pumped, we twisted and gestured. We yelled at each other over how great the music was, all whilst trains of girls continually snaked through the crowds, each grabbing onto the hands of the other. The men never did move around much, but the girls always seemed to be going somewhere, be it the toilet or the rear of the dance floor, or to the DJ stand or podium. The continually changing sight of different women and different body parts brushing against me was not a bad thing, I thought.My dressing was extra sharp today, and I felt no need to approach any woman. I’m the attraction, and besides, our objective today was to have a good time celebrating a buddiy’s birthday, not to hunt. We just laughed as the birthday boy continually got shot down, whilst some of the other boys effortlessly had women hanging off them. It was good fun, and the sexual tension was heavy as the partygoers visually undressed each other. Hands roamed, and tongues explored, all whilst the crowd leaned and swayed with the rhythm. The hot mess of bodies against the freezing cold of the club brought images of emperor penguins to my mind. A random fat bro awkwardly holding his drink tried to strike a conversation up with the uninterested texting girl, who simply ignored him. I shot him an apologetic look as he shrugged his shoulders.“Why the fuck are you here to text if you are not here to dance sia?!” Fat bro and me agreed and we instantly became best buddies for the night, all whilst texting girl continued staring at her glass shell encased iphone screen. There would be an occasional shove, and a bright light would flash. The bouncers would quickly yeet troublemakers out, and the crowd will form over the empty space mere moments later. Similar attempts were made as we cheered and chanted to occasional tunes. None of us were gangsters, but the chants were too electrifying for anyone to care, for it was the anthem of the night. The atmosphere was stimulating, and we rode on the waves of ecstasy.The hot girls on the podiums would rotate, and little by little, we were crowded towards the front. Before long, we were at the front, and suddenly, my buddy was pushed up. The ever loving mushroom(fungi) that he was, he was quick to drag me up as well, and all of a sudden, we were shamelessly gyrating around as the rest of the group laughed. The hot girls locked their eyes on us, and we danced with such intensity that it felt obscene. We were having too good a time, that it almost felt like the other partygoers were voyeurs. I was jolted from my merrymaking, when I felt my buddy crowding against me, and I looked over to see where a larger lady had tried to join the fun. The podium was not that big, and together with the hot girls, we tried to shove the newcomer off. She stepped off, and tried to come up again. This was a fun game for her, as she was laughing and smiling whilst her friends guffawed and encouraged her. In a last ditch attempt to regain her footing, she grabbed onto my attire with both hands, akin to a man attempting to start a fight where they scrunch their adversary’s collar. For the first time in my life, I contemplated striking a woman. The thought was quickly overcome with sense and reason, as I tried to convey my discomfort to her. My desire for her to release my clothing was falling on deaf ears, as she was happily laughing away at my requests. A few more repeat attempts, and I had no choice. I grabbed her wrists and pried her dead clammy fingers off, condemning the poor fools beneath her to a soul crushing experience as she fell back with shock and screams rose. The men cheered and laughed as back thumps were dealt out, as did the ladies who were now grabbing me and puling me and my buddy back into their warmth. All while the pulped screamed in terror. We were heroes, Ahab and Peleg who had done a great service, and we were accorded the treatment as such. The brave would blatantly rub their bodies against us, while the shy settled for quick strokes and discrete squeezes. Either way, there was no shortage of women and drinks for the rock stars of the night, and the initial guilt I felt was quickly drowned out amongst the soft flesh and gentle caresses. The night melted away into a deluge on the senses, and the next thing we knew, we were stumbling out into the dead of the morning. It was silent and dark, with hushed whispers and pools of vomit and drunk revellers. Men that had struck out stood around smoking, while the ladies that were unclaimed lay in a heap as their friends tried to rouse them. The air was stale and sticky, with the allure of the handsome men and beautiful women now a repulsive mess of smudged makeup and sweaty hair gel. It was dead quiet, but our ringing ears and hoarse throats made speech troublesome, to say the least.We bid our good byes and stumbled into our individual waiting cabs and private hires. The eye rolls of the drivers and sympathetic onlookers was quickly forgotten as I pass out in the speeding vehicle. It was a night to be remembered, and the memory will be recounted for years to come. Nonetheless, the toll it takes on the body and mind is a cost too much to bear often.Never again, I told myself.And lo and behold, my wish was granted when covid came. I dust the covers off my instagram bed time stories archive, and heave a sigh as I look back upon how different life has been since 30 years ago. My grand son has fallen asleep, while my daughter tuts at my tall tales as she changes out from her day use hazmat suit. With a sigh, I close the chapter of my untimely youth, but cannot help rue that the younger generation never had theirs.-#99063: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99063",0,1,0,3,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
#99062,17/5/2020,"I'm so tired of being at home. Anyone here had to grow up with emotionally abusive parents? The kind of suffocation you can never get away from feels really overwhelming at times.I remember when i was a kid, she would always guilt trip me with the standard 'when i die already you will regret it' and 'there is no one who will treat you better than me' whenever i do not listen to her. She is the most paranoid person i have ever known. I lock my room's door before i go to bed as i do not like my parents barging into my room as and when they want and overstep their boundaries. Whenever my mother knocks on my door and I do not respond within X minutes, she would assume that I have fainted or died, and then use the duplicate set of keys to barge into my room. Being a heavy sleeper myself, i really do not understand why she has to be so paranoid when i or anyone around us do not have any history of suicide.When i was interning, there were days with OTs and sometimes after work we had dinners with colleagues. My mother would start spam calling me if i was not home by 8.30pm. After some time i started ignoring her calls as her tone made me really mentally drained. If i tell her that i am having dinner outside and will reach home slightly later, she would say things like 'so tmr no need to work? No need to sleep?' and proceed to hang up the call before i reply, only to call me again 10 minutes later. I have very minimal social life because of how controlling she is. Over time i found out that she has this sick habit of looking through my things when i am outside or when i am bathing. I have slight OCD so i do remember the way i place my things.She monitors me around the house and even checks on whether i have finished my food. I have caught her opening up my takeaway containers several time just to see how much food i have left. She tells me that i am hungry and that i should eat when i am really not hungry. Then she accuses me of lying about not being hungry. Really speechless about this.Before you trash me for being unfilial because i complained about my mother, please consider how tough and toxic it is growing up with a manipulative person. As far as i can remember, she always tells me that she does not like it when i go out and she is the happiest when i am at home. She tells everyone that she treats and understands me the best when in fact she does not. Is that not downright manipulation? Whenever i try to communicate with her about how much additional stress she was giving me because of everything she did, she does not feel that her parenting method is wrong. She even brings home amulets for me to drink because she feels that 'dirty things' are making me stressed. Since then i have given up all sorts of healthy and proper communication with her and i just have to endure till i am ready to move out on my own. My aunt had tried to talk her into being more open and letting go but it does not get to her. My father does not try to persuade her at all and even sides with her during confrontations.Thank you for listening to my rant. I find my situation so pathetic and laughable. Some days i really want to go to sleep and never wake up again so i do not have to face them.-#99062: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99062",20,2,0,12,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

#99060,17/5/2020,"Not sure about what people have been thinking about NUS staffs' salary. However, I do feel strongly that NUS HR should provide a more enticing (competitive) salary. Even though with years of experience under my belt, I was only given a monthly salary about a few hundred more than a fresh grad. Moreover, I would be graduating from a NUS masters program soon and the HR informed me that there would be no change in the salary package even with a re-contract. Isn't it weird that NUS HR is undermining their own students and also their own value by providing a salary that is way below the market perceived range? The reason the HR provided was a NUS policy stating that they would only be able to provide a 10% increment in salary if you had just left a NUS position which was anything that is less than 2 years. This kind of disregarded the efforts taken for self improvement during the gap that was mainly caused by the current Covid-19 situation. Also, a few of my friends had gotten job offers from NUS, but the salary package is so minimal that it is even lower than what they had been earning. I have known of vacancies that had been opened for an entire year simply cos the salary that is being offered is too low, wont leaving a vital position open for so long result in a detrimental effect to the entire department? The other staffs would have to take on more responsibility and beyond what they can handle, these staffs would quit as well. Granted that we are not the top level managing executives but I felt that if the operating staffs are underpaid, as soon as knowledge and experience is gained, these staffs are going to leave, this leaves NUS with only fresh and inexperienced staffs which in the long run would just result in a loss to NUS as a whole.-#99060: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99060",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#99044,12/7/2021,"Hi all, posting this here since I'm not too sure where to ask this question. My dad recently received a quarantine order that was supposed to end at 12pm. However, the person doing the exit swab for him only called near midnight saying that he's coming soon, when it is supposed to be done within the QO period. Of course my dad refused and asked him to come back the next morning, since his QO has ended and he has to work the next day. Instead of coming down to swab in the morning, MOH decided to slap my dad with another QO for another week. My dad is self employed, and while he understand and has complied fully with the QO, he is paying for the negligence of the swabber who failed to come on time. Furthermore, this could have been resolved simply by swabbing the next morning, instead of further delaying the swab test by imposing another QO. Tried calling MOH, but then learned about the difficulties others faced trying to get through any of their hotlines. I suspect that any emails will also be ignored, because what's stopping them right?What should we do about this? It seems like my dad is being forced to choose between the swabber banging on our door at midnight or having another QO. He is fully vaccinated and has complied to the QO fully, so why is he being treated like some criminal under surveillance?-#99044: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99044",35,13,10,0,0,22,0,13,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
#99043,12/7/2021,"@prof benI understand where you are coming from with regards to the rent seeking behavior of singaporeans. I myself worked hard from a lower-middle class family to become business owner recently, I am realizing the economic realities of the world we work in.The rent is controlled by people who have disproportionate resources to purchase lump sums of land and be able to build up on it. One can justify that these individuals have put in the work and organized resources/labor to achieve this and as such are rewarded for it. But now understanding how my neighbouring businesses work (we talk occasionally) I realize that a lot of the prices are due to 1. the salary expectations of the businessmen (most expect to earn at least 20-30k per month at least) 2. the rental that we pay. These two factors are the main things that determine where the prices are set. Its very easy to see that, just a 5 minute walk away from the mall we work in, the drastic difference in prices and the way things are run operationally.As such, they cut down on the prices of the labour. by pushing wages for entry level jobs to 1.7-1.9k, even though they could easily pay much more, and the government knows about this (clearly from taxes) but doesn't do anything to encourage the rise in wagesBut on the otherhand, as a business owner, I am guessing that the govt might be doing this on purpose because they recognize that if the labor force is able to pay off their housing loans quickly, and then have enough disposable income to afford a comfortable lifestyle, then guess what, based on supply and demand, the cost of living will increase, and people will be less motivated to work hard at their jobs for a sustained period. It is the pricing of houses (shelter being a basic necessity) and the tiered pricing of private housing that keeps the populace continually striving, (“its been 5 years we shuold upgrade to condo/ I hope to live in landed in 30 yrs”) and continually contributing to the economy and keeps the wheels spinning. There is a certain narrative around housing that Singaporeans have perpetuated already. With housing being one of the largest portions of spending each month for most adults, it is these narratives around housing and the social status attached to it that keeps our labor force constantly churning. Which is good for the government.Otherwise why else do we constantly hear stories of our friends accepting jobs that make us work almost 10 hours a day 6 days a week, and complain about how long the hours we work are.. but they dont/cant do anything about it (because they 'need' to work to pay for their kid's tuition or housing loan or car loan etc)I think the structure is on purpose. and housing prices arent coming down anytime soon, not in singapore at least-#99043: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99043",24,8,0,0,9,57,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
#99040,12/7/2021,"i got to know a guy from tinder in 2018 and he seemed like a really great catch. He is a pilot flying with a budget airline, so the flights are short and he will text me throughout the day as long as he is not flying. he will also try to meet me after his flights or arrange to have a short coffee even if he might be busy that day. From the time we met, he was always upfront about being close friends with his ex-gf. However, there was once i spotted him having lunch with his ex-gf and they did not look like they were just friends. When i asked him about it, he says that it's bcos she was still into him and wants to get back together. After that, he started asking me who i was out with when i spotted him and got jealous that i was out with a male colleague for lunch. it was rather sweet, so i did not question his actions further.A few weeks later, i saw a picture of him and ex on someone's IG story (cos they were helping out to be extras on a video). i sent him the pic and commented to him that his ex is really pretty and they he should've try again with her since she still into him. He just replied ok and disappeared.For the longest time, i blamed myself for chasing him away. But i eventually found out that he has been together with his ""ex"" the whole time we were dating. He was able to meet me so freely at the beginning because she was overseas! and all that time he suddenly cancelled cos he was ""busy studying"" was actually bcos she her time was suddenly available.i am sharing this because i recently found out that i was not the only person that he has told the ""ex"" story to and dated while being with her. I met someone who said that he tried to ask her out before during the same time frame. i am sharing this because his gf seems like a really nice girl who doesn't deserve a scumbag like him.

#99036,12/7/2021,"Why do jobs with the ""Manager"" in the title warrant such high pay? Associate Manager, BD Manager, Product Manger, Project Manager etc.Correct me if I am wrong, but these people (often) don't have domain expertise (ie hard skills) and rely on their soft skills which arguably is so easy. ie just write reports (as long as the general proposal/direction makes sense), reply emails, user outreach, ""manage"" technical people (which may include designers, artists, writers, producers, engineers, on the ground staff doing manual work etc). In this case, I am not referring to managers who are domain experts like Art Directors, Engineering Managers etc.The thing is - let these non creative and non technical managers switch jobs with technical people. The staff with hard skills will definitely be able to ace hardest task of the manager with ease, while most managers can't even do the easiest day to day job of the technical staff. Something as simple as design a logo, or maybe write a script to automate stuff; let's see how long a manager - who often earns significantly higher or at least on par with the technical staff - takes to do such a task. You can say managing people is an ""extremely difficult"" soft skill. I beg to differ. Soft skills are simply a byproduct of assimilation into your environment, and require no special effort to hone. How many people who pride themselves on their ""soft skills"" have picked up a book, or gone to a class to learn it? Place someone with little soft skills in a social environment, and they will be able to pick it up automatically. Place someone who has no hard skills in a creative, technical environment, and most likely they will be able to produce results. For those managers who actively try to learn about their domain by reading up on books and taking courses, fair enough. Or managers who actively go above and beyond to improve company culture, processes and the overall team dynamics, then sure, the manager probably deserves the high pay. But for managers who sit on their high horse and think that the title and pay makes them better than their technical staff, think again. The technical staff can replace you with a click of their fingers, it's just that they choose not to.

I started to spiral, when you're constantly told that you are wrong no matter what you do by someone you love it gets to you. Eventually I grew numb, I withdrew from my friends and family and just became a punching bag for her when she was stressed out about anything. I honestly don't know what to do, I don't want to breakup and she knows that. She threatens to breakup multiple times a week to get her way, I'm just so tired, tired of never being enough.-#99033: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99033",29,3,0,15,0,27,0,8,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
#99028,12/7/2021,"Hey Prof Ben, I saw your comment regarding BTO in one of the NUSWhispers post. keen to hear more about your thoughts on it. I agree with you that economically, it kinda make sense - match demand and supply, also as a mechanism to keep young Singaporeans in singapore because now house = home. But socially, it’s nuts. It make young people commit to possibly  biggest financial expense in life 4-5 years in advance, and let BTO drive their life timeline. What if you are not ready when the BTO is ready (and worse still, you secured a great location say Queenstown, Geylang, Bishan)? Money makes people emotional, and emotions drive less than rational decisions. And when you’re young, that 500k value is SIGNIFICANT. I actually think that the G knows this (come on, they have so many smart people in civil service), but no one wants to do something about it. When do you think they will really do something about it?-#99028: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99028",37,33,0,0,0,56,0,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Nobody knew he was suffering with severe depression. He kept it hidden to himself for so many years as he showed no symptoms whatsoever. A joyful and intelligent kid. We only knew about his depression (suffering since high school) when we read the letter he left for all of us. After so many years, we are still deeply hurt and upset for what he had done. Wished he could have seek help and advise because we would have understand his situation with open arms. His passing left a huge impact on our minds and healthy and slowly some of the family members is experiencing depression and anxiety as well after the incident.I literally still dream of him at night and wish he was still around. I believe there’s plenty of people suffering from depression and anxiety but kept it hidden very well from their family members. Please seeks for help and reach out to your family members because the damage you left them is severely hurtful and it takes a lifetime for them to forget about you.

They do it since young and for over a decade!In my opinion, Joseph should be exempted from NS. By winning Singapore's ONLY Olympic gold medal. That in itself, should qualify as National Service.Even though he didn't perform up to expectations at this year's Olympics, so what? He has contributed more to the nation than any NS man already.

Let me give you an example. When I refill the body wash and my sister feels that ist running out too fast, she would ask me ""Is it you use too much or when you refill you never refill properly?"". I always use only 2 presses the same as I have always used. No chnage. And I'm confident that I squeezed the refill. Sometimes when the dog asks for more food after a meal, she would ask"" You give very little is it? "". I give the same amount as any other time. 3 spoons of died food with boiled ground pork and frozen vegetables. I know these things sound trivial. Most of the time I tell myself that it's a trivial and let it slide but once in a while it gets on my nerves. It's like she thinks I'm dumb and she is questioning me. She is the judge for everything. Things are only right if she thinks so. If she thinks I'm not doing a good job, she is welcomed to add on. If she thinks I'm not feeing the dog enough then be my guess. Give him more when he asks. There's no need to ask if I gave too little. Deviations happen once in a while. I have grown to be nervous around her. Anything I do can be questioned and I have to be ready to defend myself. ""Is it you never do properly? Is it you not persuasive enough? Is it you never say the right things? Is it you never do what she!/he wants?"". And the worst question I was asked was ""Is it you lying? I don't think so. What you say and the results don't match leh"". How do I get out of the last qn? If my sis alrdy thinks I'm lying then what would make her believe I'm telling the truth? This is my house too. Its stupid that I have to tipt toe around. Life is complicated. Things do happen outside of our expectations. Evetytime I defend myself. She gives me the cold shoulder for months. She ignored me for almost a year at home behind my parents, she only talks to me in front of our parents. Only these few weeks then she start talking to me in private.

#99021,12/7/2021,"I am an NUS alumna and a mother of two. Before more people start attacking the KTV culture and deeming it to be a “dirty old men's hobby that can be easily eradicated”, I think there are some points for the public to understand:The KTV is not a dirty old men's hobby. Patrons come in all shapes and sizes. Many patrons are young – army boys “walking this rite of passage”, university students, young MNC executives, etc. Patrons are not people who cannot get girls, some just feel that the commercial intimacy path is more honest and hassle-free (more on this in the next point). Patrons are not bad, sleazy people. Patrons can be your JC crush, your kind mentor, the family member you love regardless. Understanding this is important because it is an issue that must be approached with empathy. Seeing it as an unrelatable far-away dirty old men's thing does not help.KTV (alongside all other businesses in the commercial intimacy scene) is not immoral, because how else should single people get intimacy? Getting a girlfriend at all costs? Is it really ethical to start relationships for intimacy and putting all long-term considerations in the backseat? Will this lead to more heartbreaks and disillusionment? What about Tinder hook-ups? Are hook-ups moral then? Is the exchange really fair for both parties? In a commercial transaction, every unfairness is balanced out with money. Given that intimacy is a basic need in the Maslow’s hierarchy, where should guys who cannot get hook-ups go?If KTV (and all other forms of commercial intimacy) is close/relatable and not immoral, then what should we do? We should accept it. Think of it like having a gay child: the only way is to acknowledge his orientation and accept him. If you do not, he will simply keep inside his closet, and you will lose touch with him and miss opportunities to ensure his safety. There will only be less transparency, more secrets and lying and betrayal. When society fully accepts commercial intimacy, regulations and protocols to protect all parties can be implemented, and all outbreaks (of COVID-19, of STIs, of violence) can be prevented. Society will always be safer with authority-managed hostesses than with hostesses hiding underground. As a mother, I will not call for the closure of hostess KTVs and instead call for hostess KTVs to be government-managed: with robust health checks and identity tracking (albeit keeping all data confidential).Blaming and self-denial will not stop COVID-19, only openness and acceptance can.-#99021: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/99021",40,14,0,7,19,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Just wanted to share my story.I’ve been single practically my whole life (25 years) and been on multiple failed dates (mostly through apps). None of them ever lasted more than a month. After each failure I always wondered, ‘is there something wrong with me?’ ‘are my standards too high?’ ‘why doesn’t anyone seem to get me?’ ‘why can xxx get attached and I can’t?’ and I would get very disheartened coz I thought all my efforts to find ‘the one’ were useless.But, looking back I realise, all those ‘failures’ were not for naught. Thanks to all those failed dates, I learned more about the person I am, what I can and cannot tolerate in a person and what I am truly looking for in a partner. (Plus, I have some GREAT ‘weirdest dates ever’ experience.) Now, I am happily attached to the sweetest, most caring person I’ve ever met.

This is not even because I am consevrative. I am actually very liberal. I am up for anything. It isn't even due to a lack of trying. I am on 4 dating apps and honestly it's exhausting.

#99009,10/7/2021,"My BF and I have been dating for 3 years now. Coming from a religious and traditional family, my family initially did not like him as he did not go down the traditional Singaporean kid route - he did his own business, went on to work overseas for a few years (now he's back indefinitely cos of covid)and isn't in the same line of work as me. When we were doing LDR, we kept in constant contact. We have come a long way since we met. The days that he was overseas, it was really really tough for me but Im glad I survived that through weekly Skype and phone calls. I feel we are very compatible in all areas, and we are thinking about marriage. We have mostly worked and talked through most issues successfully, but 1 big mountain stands in the way -  religion. Religion wise, I have accepted him as he is and do not expect him to convert, but Im not sure if my parents will. They still try to convert him, and although he is civil when he is with them, he says that it makes him very unhappy as he feels unaccepted. He needs their acceptance before marriage, of which I have promised a talk with my parents but they are also very strong headed people. I cannot bear the thought of losing him. He says he does not want to cause a conflict between me and them, but there is already disgruntledness now at the thought that I may lose him because of them. I am even willing to distance myself from my family if it causes him so much unhappiness (ie cut down on the time he needs to spend with them) but he needs 200% acceptance from them. Not willing as well to believe that acceptance is a gradual thing and hopefully eventually they will. What are your thoughts? I want to be a filial child but on the other hand I cannot lose him.

#99008,10/7/2021,"I would like to share my childhood story. Now I'm close to 30. I realised I have had unfairness in my childhood, which affected my life and career choice. I remember I was an active, sincere and talented child who loved painting, singing, dancing and I was very enthusiastic student in my primary school. I helped (I believed that I was helping) my younger brother with his classes in his primary studies, mostly doing his homework assignments by myself, as my brother was lazy. I used to draw different paintings and I enjoyed it. I dreamed to send my paintings to national journal for children and publish it there. And I did it! But... I felt that I didn't have much support and encouragement (as much as I needed) from my parents about my paintings. My brother was funny and cute child and also loved drawing, and he received so much encouragement from our parents and relatives. One day, me and my brother gave (casual) interview to a local newspaper and gave them our paintings. When our interview and two of our paintings are published, I found out that both of the paintings are drawn by me, but for one of them they gave the credit to my brother! (I know my parents made it, because this painting was the good one and they wanted to give false credit to my brother)! My school teacher told me that my brother's painting is better than mine, but both paintings are actually mine! I was 11 y.o. at that time, I was a sensitive child and I didn't know how to digest it, but for my parents and brother, it was not a big deal. After more than 15 years, I realise it was so unfair towards me!Now I realize that for whole my life till today, I have been seeking the approval of my parents in whatever I was doing. Somehow my parents believed in my abilities in math. Since I was good at my school studies, my parents always encouraged me to have excellent grades (so that I can have good career in the future). So I continued to focus in math in middle school, high school, college and after. Now I realize that math is not my passion and it changed my artistic nature. But I still remember that unfairness and want to let it go. I am writing here to give advice to young and future parents. Please ask your child what he/she enjoys doing and encourage them in this path for 100%. And please always be fair. Also, I hesitate to bring this topic to my parents.

#99001,10/7/2021,"Closure with an ex-lover:  Dear Mr _ _ _ (a pet name I gave you), it's been 1.5 years now since I made the decision to end our 3-yr-plus relationship. That was a time in our late twenties when I'd actually wanted to settle down. It was definitely an excruciating decision and a painful memory now, though I don't regret it. ""Do good and be kind"", you said. I griped to you afterwards that that kindness wasn't for us. I remember the wonderful days we used to strive together in the same job, talk at length about our hopes and dreams into the night and cradle each other as we retold childhood memories with tears streaking down our faces. I remember watching Titanic with you on yr desktop and then having you sob uncontrollably in the middle of the night as you related to me the grief after your grandfather's passing, a knowledge only we share. I remember having long conversations with you near my workplace, walking around the CBD area and just soaking in each others' presence. When we'd just gotten together, you travelled with me on my first company trip and threw me a well-planned birthday shortly after. I remember preparing welfare items for you when you juggled uni and work. We loved the same food, had the same adventurous sprit and were both intellectually curious. We were very much in love and very much aligned. I really did love you and what came after broke me.There was the gambling vice, acts of disrespect and numerous lies... all of which unveiled a very different character under pressure. As we progressed on in the relationship, you appeared more selfish, materialistic and less caring in general. Remember the time I broke down after I'd thought you'd died when you didn't show up at work, when in fact you'd been arrested for being in an illegal gaming den? You smiled (almost) when I received you at the police station when my whole heart had imploded with disappointment and hurt. That wasn't the first time you failed us but it was the worst and the subsequent many other lies exacerbated them. From the beginning, there were traces of questionable values but i didn't let them stop me from agreeing to be your girlfriend. For instance, for the purpose of achieving sales targets at work, you got cheated by a supposedly wealthy Indo lady (who turned out to be a con artist) and paid for her expensive phone bills in the belief that she'd buy a huge-premium product from you. I spent much time hunting her down and getting her to return you the thousands you'd lost in installments. During argument periods in the relationship, you disrespectfully chatted up your ex crush to confide in her about our private struggles or check out other girls on social media because you said the relationship wasn't fulfilling. As your career took off, you also became increasingly fixated on making money/appearing successful on social media and focused less on the relationship. I started blaming your job and also became afraid of losing you to your vices and became paranoid and clingy. It was through checking on you that I subsequently realized how many more times you'd lied about going for sales appointments when you were out gambling or drinking with friends. Back then, nobody knew the full story and were puzzled about my paranoia and frustrations. Unbeknownst to them, I only uncovered your lies after the 9th or 10th time that you'd lied precisely because I'd trusted you; the price of that was hurt. I know today that what went 'wrong' (e.g. yr vices/materialism) wasn't about yr job or surroundings per se, the onus was on you who chose those courses of actions. A healthy relationship shouldn't require doses of checking because both parties are truthful and responsible.  Recognizably, I became a bitter, angry and unlikeable person in the relationship and I hated how it had messed my emotions. In the later stages of the relationship, I even subconsciously wanted to conceal my face whenever I went out with you because I was ashamed of who I'd become. It's been a long time coming to terms with our demise, but at least, I can respect the person I am today. I chose to stay true to my values and my happiness is no longer dictated by the one who stopped caring. It is with regret that we will always be strangers from hereon out. I saw that you'd messaged me last year but I couldn't see the attachment and neither did I wish to reconnect. To me, the hurt you'd brought to my life is unforgivable. To the man I used to love, in health or in sickness and amid the plenty of lemons that life may throw at us ahead, we're on our own now. Time does reveal a person's character, so I hope you're no longer sucked into the life of posing for social media to sell your material success and instead strive to be a better person (inside) always.

I started to think about what could have caused his loss. Physique is one thing. Next comes the lane he's in when he was doing his heats. He was placed at the edge of the pool. I believe many of us have watched a lot of pool action, and would have noticed that most wins happen at the middle lanes. But Joseph was at a disadvantage. He got the last lane. Sure, all pools are the same. Water same. Environment same. But the feeling is just not the same. Y'all know what I mean? Being able to see your opponents left right is an important adrenaline pumper. But for his case, he was not able to..Then I see ppl commenting on his body shape. I'm not sure of the gold standard body for swimming, but I compared his current form with Michael. Yeah the Michael he defeated. Michael is longer, a bit more streamlined, and leaner. Not entirely sure whether his current physique played a part, but I hope not? Because I'm pretty sure there are many nutritionists, coaches watching his weight and condition.

His experience brought me, and I'm sure many of y'all, back to the days in uni. Before an exam, you think you put in all of your efforts. You gave your best. Studied your tutorials, redid your tutorials, consulted tutors and lecturers, rewatched lectures and discussed with friends. You practised for finals. Your progress looked great. You felt prepared! But fast forward a few weeks when the results came out. Hey..what happened? C? Not even a B? Then, that's when you knew. Effort and your 'best' do not always equate to success. Yeah it hurts. You think you gave your all? Someone out there might be better than you. Someone in your major might put in more effort than you. Someone beside you might know more tips than you. You never know! You cry. You lament the harsh reality and unfairness of it all. C is a low pass. It will affect your CAP. Should you retake the course? Waste time on it again? Or focus on other courses? It's what Joseph is experiencing now I guess. I'm very sure he put in his best effort. His coaches gave him their all too. He felt well prepared, he felt great and he felt that he could win again. But someone out there got the better of him. From the initial skepticism and criticism within me to thinking about how his experience is just like any of ours years ago in uni, I feel a bit embarrassed. Too quick to judge. Too hasty and nitpicky. That's when I could feel his sadness within me, and I saw myself in my room again, holding onto my phone looking at the SMS results. C. Joseph (like I'm your friend lol). Or anyone reading this, know that your best effort may not always work out. Yes, it's reality. Most of us have been through similar experiences, just not at an international level. Know that you are not alone. You have your friends. Your coach. Your family. And many of us back in sg waiting for you and cheering you on. You may not have the chance to bring back the gold this time. But I hope the next time when you meet your opponents in the pool, you bring together with you our support, our cheers and our passion with you. Your best effort is enough. P.s. some people may think that prayers do not come into the picture. But hey, whatever that can help, I'm all for it.-#98996: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98996",51,50,0,0,0,381,45,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Currently, I have the compulsory medishield life hospital insurance without private hospital coverage. I also have a term personal accident plan covering 100k bought during my time in army and I only signed up because they kept promoting it. In the past, my parents bought life insurance for me and my siblings- the kind which covers you for life and which has cash value at the end of the policy but you need to pay a significant sum every month. Some years back, my dad was retrenched. As our finances became tight, he could not afford to keep up the premiums and has to cancel those life insurance and suffered a big loss. Since then, I have been hesitant to get another life insurance as I believe there is no job stability nowadays and I may get retrenched in my 40s/ 50s and repeat my dad's history. Idk if my current insurance are sufficient for my needs as I am quite clueless about insurance matters. I didn't really want to find an insurance agent as I don't really trust if they will push their products just for their commission or recommend those in my best interests.

Travel agencies slowly became a dying career prospect.I received my offer letter from NUS to study Economics, Humanities and Sciences with the provision of a grant on 17th June, 2021.The pandemic dealt a final blow to the already dwindling business. Business was negligible during 2020 due to travel restrictions resulting in the lowest income in years. Business had to be shut down completely and my father had to start a new business from scratch this year. We cannot take education loans with high interest rates at this juncture with such an unstable and weak financial position. Additionally, my brother will go to college this year hence it will add to the expenditure. In the present circumstances, my family will be unable to afford even the subsidised fee.I have applied for scholarships, but, haven’t received a positive response yet, mainly for two reasons. First, I am an International student, hence that makes me ineligible for most of the externally funded scholarships and ALL the faculty donated scholarships. Second, most of the scholarships are for science / tech / engineering / medicine courses, hence, that makes me ineligible for both scholarships funded by external organisations and ALL NUS funded scholarships as well. I am reaching out to you, because I have heard you have helped students like me before with questions like these.

#98985,9/7/2021,"I just want to thank Prof. Ben for reminding me (and us) that life is only a rat race if you choose to live it that way. His advice on this forum has saved me from implosion by leading me to make a life-changing decision to give up a high-paying job that I absolutely hated, in exchange for a job that I was okay with, a job that paid me an above-average (comfortable) salary, but a job that ultimately allowed me to spend more time with my wife and daughter.Dear Proffy,I went to RJ like you did. I studied CS (and applied math) like you did (albeit at Berkeley). My parents paid through their noses for me to go. My wife was my childhood friend. Our mothers were very close friends and we practically grew up together. When I decided to leave for California, I had already been dating her. I knew then that I was going to marry her. She knew too. In my mind, I felt that I had a responsibility to earn as much money as I could so I can give her the best life she could ever have asked for. But I never asked her what she wanted. I came back for a few years after graduating to work at a stat board, but I wasn't able to make a lot of money. I got married, had a beautiful daughter, but we were living in a HDB and I wanted better for my family. Partly through my college connections, I got a job at a FAANG. I discussed it over with my wife, and she agreed to let me go. She has a really mild personality and she tends to bottle everything in. In hindsight I should've sensed that she was heartbroken, but I was too distracted by a need to give her the best life that I could that I didn't realize the fact that all she wanted was just to have me around. I left for the valley and I spent 4 years there. I tried to come back as often as I could.I hated that job. I won't go into details about why I hated it, but I now understand that it wasn't just the job, I was just in a really self-destructive headspace. I was never from a very wealthy family and my expenses are very low. But after I got married my whole outlook changed. I wanted to be able to afford the best, not for me, but for my wife and kid. After 4 years of missing my family every second of every day, I decided to come home. I now work for GovTech, doing boring stuff, but I am happy every day because I get to go to sleep with my wife by my side.

They always tell me it’s only right for me to help with chores since we are siblings. But how come they never ever say that to my siblings? Just because I am obliging and don’t voice out anything?

#98971,9/7/2021,"TLDR: Sister tells disabled brother to sell his flat and move in with her, then goes back on words to chase him out after taking his money and insurance payout, leaving him nowhere to shift to.I am neither the sister nor the brother, I am just a friend.The brother got into a car accident around 10 years ago, and is paralyzed from chest down. He has been staying at his sister’s house for the past few years, in the living room of her maisonette, which has a balcony where he can get bathed by his caretaker. He actually had a HDB, but because his medical supplies are expensive, he wanted to sell the flat. Before selling the flat, he asked his sister, like “you sure I can sell the flat?”. The sister said sure of course you can stay here. So, he sold the flat.Fast forward just few months after he sold the flat, the sister said he had to leave. She says that because of him, her family doesn’t have a living room anymore, and she has to do her work with a low chair as her table (she does not want to do her work on the dining table because the height of the table does not match her sitting position), she says she has been “looking forward to paint her living room walls”. Also, because he travels around in a motorized wheelchair, when he comes back to the house, it leaves dirt on the floor that apparently the maid does not clean well. Because of these reasons, she wants him out of the house.The brother has been unemployed, for obvious reasons. You might ask, then just buy another flat right? Nope. The sister had been in control of his bank account because he trusted her to take care of his finances after receiving his insurance payout, but she has been taking his money for years without him knowing. It was only this year that he found out. She took 200k+ from him to help pay for a property overseas, and as of now, yet to fully return him. She had also been deducting money as rent and utilities without telling him about it. She has also been wasting his money, around 20k, on unnecessary things like geomancy. The sister says that the brother has sufficient money in his bank & CPF to buy a flat. Sure, but if he buys a flat, he really wouldn’t have enough money to sustain his life, given that he is unemployed. He needs to buy food, medical supplies, money for caretaker… It would literally deplete all his savings. He has also been unable to rent a flat, either under HDB or elsewhere. HDB, because he is ineligible due to the regulations. Homeowners, upon hearing that he is disabled, don’t want to rent to him. Even if he were so lucky to be able to rent outside, it would be expensive, same as the reasons stated few sentences above.Take note, she actually has an unoccupied room on the second floor of the maisonette because her daughter had moved out after getting married. I felt that if she wanted to, she could make the room a living room for themselves since they are physically able to climb to the second floor. She can get a table in that room that matches her height since that’s so important to her.I really don’t understand how one can be so cruel to chase a disabled sibling out of the house. To me, the problem all started when she guaranteed him a place to stay and letting him sell his house. Who would have thought that she would suddenly backtrack on her words? After all, they are siblings, why is she so cruel? I want to know if any of you reading this have another perspective to help me understand why she thinks it is okay to do all this. Also, if anyone could see if there are any actions he could possibly take legally in this situation.

#98966,9/7/2021,"One thing I regret was studying too much during my Uni days.As a working adult in a managerial position, it really irks me that I'm usually the ONLY person in the interview panel who actually cares about what the applicant's GPA is. I'm talking about entry-level hires by the way, not mid-career hires. Obviously nobody cares what your GPA is once you are applying for mid career positions but I would have thought GPA would be a significant factor in entry level roles.I've noticed that the rest of the interviewers usually don't pay much attention to the candidate's GPA. For me, I always found that good grades reflect important qualities such as discipline, diligence, responsibility, capability and to an extent, intelligence. All important qualities needed to succeed in the work place.But I feel like I'm in the minority as everyone else usually just takes a passing glance at the candidate's GPA, and generally pay more attention to internship experience, attitude and vibe. Call me old fashioned but internship experience is normally negligible (how much can you possibly learn in a few months) and attitude and vibe are very superficial qualities that anyone can easily fake during an interview. But you can't fake a good GPA.So unless you are gunning for a high level position like IB where GPA is a requirement, the rest of you just pass and get degree can already.I see so many of you here stressing over your GPA but trust me, it's like NS like that.When you are in NS, doing well and getting into command school can feel like the most important thing in the world. It's only when you ORD that you realise nobody gives a shit about what you did during NS.Same for GPA.

She’s like the kind of perfect girl anyone can dream of. A very nice and funny girl. Comes from an above average family background. Looks pretty, cute and with a lovely smile. Problem is, shit happens along the way. She went on to NUS and went on to be a teacher. For the both of us, we just drifted apart. The trigger was something that wasn’t even my fault. I even apologised for it because ultimately, I was the only person she send her photo(it was only a normal photo) but apparently, my dick “friend” went  through my phone while I was playing football to download it off, and somehow, she found out. I didn’t even bother to ask her how she knew. Probably that dick guy was messaging her, gotten her number from my phone as well. (That dick guy was out of my life, and that was the day, I set password to my phone using her birthdate till now)That was probably the start when she couldn’t trust me. I felt so guilty, I didn’t know what to do. I chose to accept the consequences. And walk away. Previously, I knew her ex-bf, schoolmate of us during that first 3 months and he was jealous of me being her classmate and close friend, I did told him that she will only be my good friend, nothing more. I totally regret that statement. Cos the relationship evolved and grew deeper after that first 3 months. And I just couldn’t dare to ask her out formally on dates. Cos I did told her exactly what I told her ex-bf. From JC, and then she went to NUS, and then to NTU. Bumped into her in school back then, couldn’t talk much. Cos I still felt so guilty, when she ask me again about the photo. That was when I realised, the bus has left. I think she’s giving me a chance to tell the truth. But that was the truth!10 years later, I still miss her. No other girl ever made me feel connected and special. She was the one who made me into a better person, write formally even in messages. Shared similar interest in music and anime. Funny thing is, I was never attracted to her sexually even though she look above average, I was more attracted to her personality and her thoughts. 15 years on, I did try to search on her, and saw her wedding(without her face of course, just the wedding card and her guests). The guy is a smart guy, just like her, who shares similar music interest like the 2 of us. Could have been us. But the mistake of the youth could never been undone. I tried to forget about her. But 15 years later, fuck it. Just gonna keep good memories of her instead. I’m just glad she changed me for the better. The kind of person I am now, is largely thanks to her. And I don’t regret meeting her for those few years. She’s married now, what’s the point of trying to contact her. With that, this is probably an anonymous letter to end it as just memories.

#98949,9/7/2021,"I need advice here from chemistry majors or anyone who can relate. How do u deal with a boss who has the mindset that just because you have a chemistry degree, you are expected to know every single thing about chemistry? Or to know every single thing that ""appears"" to be chemistry?So I graduated with a chemistry degree (materials specialisation) and ended up working in an engineering lab.  And I have a boss whos more focused towards the sales and has absolute no knowledge of anything in chemistry.Incident 1 occurred where I loaded some printed circuit board (PCB) samples onto a wooden rack for electrical testing in the machine. After the testing, it appeared that the coating of the PCB board underwent some form of degradation at the point of contact with the wooden rack, and there was some greenish sludge. Boss asked me what kind of chemical reaction and why did it happen. I was totally clueless about it. And the next moment he was like "" How can u not know this, you chemistry leh, this is chemistry stuff, if not I hire you for what?"". I totally didnt how to respond to his criticism and left it hanging. Its like totally unreasonable. Firstly we dont know what are the chemicals of the coating of both the wooden rack and the PCB. Secondly, even if we know what are the chemicals, we are not taught in uni how a certain specific chemical A would react with a specific chemical B.. there are millions of chemicals around and at best we can only predict based on the functional groups, that is if only we know the whole chemical structure.  ​Lastly its impossible to tell what happened by just looking at a ""greenish sludge""?Incident 2 was about the results of an unknown sample sent for SEM-EDX and the results showed Fe, O, S and C in non quantifiable ratios. On top of that theres also unknown background C and O to deal with in the machine. Basically EDX is a non quantifiable tool with limitations and u can only figure out what elements are present thats all. Boss expected me to figure out the exact chemical compound once again and it was impossible. It could be FeSO4, Fe2O3, FeS, a mixture of iron sulphides... And the next moment he blamed me again that I am supposed to know everything chemistry as a chemistry major.Incident 3 was more  of a personal question when my boss  went vaccination and there was this chemical list of active ingredients provided. Then he asked me what does each  specific chemical  have on the body. Once again I was total clueless. Iike just because its chemicals, doesnt mean  a chemistry degree should know this? This is more of a pharmacy kind of stuff?I am really sick and tired of dealing with this boss that thinks that every single thing in the world is all ""chemistry"" and I am ""supposed to know that"".

#98941,8/7/2021,"I never thought i would submit a confessions after years of seeing NUSWhispers. Idk if this will be posted but I need to rant.I think I'm just here to know the opinions of others, not to actually look for advice. I have been single for a long time without having been officially attached for almost 10 years. I have gone on dating apps and met many people but things just seem to fall short or seem forced with a lack of connection or chemistry. Recently I have met a match and it was a totally different kind of feeling compared to any of my matches. This is a combination of both chemistry and character compatibility that not just fits my threshold requirements but far outstrips it. However I am also having issues as my date recently came out of a long term relationship and they went on the app to have fun initially. However after meeting me we both hit it off really well and have this desire to keep seeing each other, it has progressed to the point where we talk about future stuff and do couple stuff like holding hands, hugging or cuddling (I'm less casual so this is kind of a big level of physical contact to me). In fact even though we are not official, there's really not much diff in the way we act now.However, there is this other match my date has from the app. Someone they matched just a week before me and didn't meet. When I found out I was quite upset, cause I'm the type who would want to date exclusively(not official) once I do physical stuff and open up about my life and hopes for the future. However my date still wants to meet others and we've talked back and forth about this 3 or 4 times. I ask them how isit they like me so much to do all these couple stuff with me but still have this need to see this one other date (they said they won't want to see others anymore, just this date) because I can't do the same thing after being this close with any of my dates. My date seem to be unsure of what they're feeling as they keep saying that they don't feel like the other date is a hopeful match but is fun to talk to. But when I ask if they can stop talking to the match since they have only talked for awhile and don't have any actual connections other than thru the dating app, my date doesn't seem to be able to stop talking. Had a heated discussion about this recently as I really don't understand. But my date said after going through a long relationship they are really scared to go into another relationship seriously and if they stop talking to the other match and only to me then it will be like an all in commitment for them already. I believe this firmly as my date cried out while saying this to me. So I try to rationalise that my date is talking to the other match because if they stop then its like a full on commitment to me but my date isn't ready emotionally. In my head I understand now and am fine with It logically, but today they went out again to meet up and I feel emotionally unhappy about it. I don't feel like talking to my date or it seems like there's a clink in the usual chemistry we have cause of this and I can't bring myself to pretend like nothing is going on. I think ill just be myself and do what I can, if it really turns out into the worst scenario where my date ends up choosing the other guy in the end, ill at least know I did what I could.Sorry for the long rant.TLDR: I'm in love but I'm tormented-#98941: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98941",46,8,0,7,0,16,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#98940,8/7/2021,"Lately, mental health has been a topic in SG which I think is a good, much needed first step. But when I see that the go-to solutions from the schools/gov/ministries are surveys and questionnaires. I just... I'm so disappointed? I understand it's still early in coming up with solutions- but to think these were the first thoughts. Big yikes. One does not simply Surveys and questionnaires are so painfully expected from the way our Singapore society works but that, at most, tackles people who are already in the midst of suffering. And let's face it, if students from schools did these, a lot don't have the emotional maturity to take things like this seriously. And at their age, I don't blame them. Some are even smart enough to realise that when something so delicate like emotional wellness is being handled over a mass survey situation, there's really not much care an individual can actually benefit from the procedure.I really wish our society just focused on building a better system to instil healthy mental wellness and practice from a young age. Make moral education(which already exists in most schools but not taken seriously) something actually taken seriously, and open up a safe space and dedicated time for serious discussions on emotional/life's struggles. Academics are important sure, but mental wellness and moral ethics (so people treat others with more care and understanding) is equally, if not more important, no?-#98940: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98940",9,6,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

#98938,8/7/2021,"Dear Prof. Ben,Since you went to RI, I’m sure you would have gotten to know some classmates/schoolmates who have now become wildly successful in their careers. And by wildly successful, I do mean very wealthy. I also don’t mean the punch-cards who are working upper-middle class jobs, being paid upper-middle class wages. I mean those who are being paid millions a year, or entrepreneurs whose businesses are making millions a year in profit.Since you were probably at the top of your cohort, do you secretly wish that you “deserve” more success than you have now? Or that they don’t deserve the wealth they’ve accumulated for not being as smart (or as hardworking) as you were in high school or in college?I ask this question because I went to Hwa Chong and I was among the top of my cohort. I pursued academia at first, because it was what I was really good at (just generally learning stuff deeply). I dragged my ass through grad school and ended up doing dead-end research for 5 years before I started a job in the industry (CS) where I was paid the same as people 10 years my junior, doing work that to me, is in all sense of the word—stupid. I have some ex-classmates who are now living in detached houses around Bukit Timah, driving luxury cars, one of whom was a middling student who used to copy my homework (he was smart just lazy). Almost every one of my crazy-rich ex-classmates are business owners, none of whom were particularly talented back in Hwa Chong. Maybe wealth doesn’t mean much to you, but I was hoping you could help me reconcile being one of the smartest person in school and now having to capitulate to the reality there’s little profit in being so academically-inclined.-#98938: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98938",288,1000,0,0,73,715,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

All this to organise a running event of which NUS already has plenty, putting it in direct competition with the Bizad Charity Run, RunNUS, and other runs that donate their proceeds to more charitable causes. And it’s not about spending money to gain more donors, because they’re spending $10 to gain $1. There are better ways to seek donations than contracting event organisers to run a running event in a student life calendar already saturated with running events.

Anyway I am ok to stay in the common room cos tbh im not very picky and we usually just doing work or watch show. Anyway due to this, I had more contact with his father and honestly he annoys the hell out of me. SighMy dad left me since young therefore I admit I do have some PTSD such as the way his dad spoke… it reminded me of my dad. I tried to put all of that aside but he even make snarky remarks and often challenge me over very stupid things like there was once I was talking about my bf about our future dog which we both liked and he just gave us a very sarcastic lecture about this topic in a scolding tone. When my bf and I are having our quiet time he barges in and comments on everything. Ps my bf has a mum but the dad seems free and likes to make unnecessary comments still. Anyway some background is I have met my last 3ex’s parents and I got along well with them because they were all very easy going and mind their own business. My final straw came when I left an unfinished project on my bf’s desk, he went to  fiddled with it and shifted some things that he felt was better than what I did. What could I have done? So now I ignore him, but I don’t think anyone notices.My bf knows his father is like that and has got into a lot of arguments with him but doesn’t put his foot down out of respect. I also don’t wish to put him in the middle which is why im stress. it stresses me out because I know he is the nosy kind and I am so scared I cannot shake him off in the future. I am ok if he is respectful but all those remarks is really unnecessary and blood boiling….. futhermore why touch my things… I just wish to hear some advice from anyone who faced the same situation as me….. i know I need to “suck thumb” now since I live under his roof but please tell me it will be ok in the end )): thankyou & ps I do get along with everyone else in the family.-#98908: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98908",22,2,0,4,0,16,0,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#98907,8/7/2021,"Hi guys, I need some advice. I have gotten myself into this love scam and that guy cheated me S$xxxx. He blocked me everywhere and had gone MIA. I have already lodged a police report, however, I was advised to sue him in state court as this is a civil matter. Thank God I know where he stays and sent my lawyer letter over, but he did not respond and continue to MIA. He is always not around when I went up to his place and look for him. His parent denied and don't believe their son will do such things. The parent then made a police report and called me a scammer. Should I hire a debt collector or sue him in the state court? But either way will require additional cost. Sigh, I was so naive back then, I shouldn't have trusted him easily and his sweet talk. I hope by sharing this, more poeple will be aware of this scammer that even the police cannot do anything to help me seek justice.

#98904,7/7/2021,"Thoughts on giving parents allowance after you start work? And if you don’t, you are deemed as unfilial? I feel like it’s honestly a redundant tradition set in our society. Personally, I would never expect my children to give me money when they are older (unless I really need it for life and death situation). Rationale being I chose to have children, hence, I am responsible for them. It’s a choice I made and it’s my responsibility to provide them with what they need to live (food, a house, education etc). It’s really horrible to see how so many parents I know measure filial piety based on how much money each child gives them. I would much rather have a child that spends time with me / helps me around the house than one that gives me money. Your children also have their own dreams and future family. Would you be happy to see them compromise on things for their own children or themselves just so you can brag about them giving you money that you don’t actually need? Of course, if my parents don’t have enough savings and need money, I would definitely give it to them in a heartbeat. But to make it seem like a necessity and shame to those who don’t, is wrong. I would much rather be able to save more and help my parents financially when they really need it than not be able to do anything because my own finances were stretched out.Ranting about this because recently I had relatives who criticised me for not giving my parents a lump sum of money every month. This is even though I make an effort to visit my parents 3 times a week, buying food and groceries for them when I visit and bringing them out to do activities together. I really hope this mindset and tradition could disappear after their generation. Not everything can be bought with money.-#98904: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98904",69,44,0,18,0,159,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#98902,7/7/2021,"""In a world where you can be anything, be kind."" This may sound like a boomer post, but I wanted to put this out there and I hope that this story can inspire kindness during these trying times especially now we’re back in semi-lockdown. Last week I was on my way to dabao lunch from a nearby hawker centre, it was crazy sunny during noon time and so hot that my dri-fit shirt was drenched in sweat. Then I saw 2 workers doing some minor construction work in the middle of the pathway. They were dressed in long sleeves and pants, had safety helmet and gloves on, as well as face mask. I thought to myself that I can’t imagine myself working under the hot sun while wearing these, not to mention it was lunch time. I didn’t think much of it and just went ahead to the hawker centre and queued up. When I came back which was about 30mins later, the same 2 workers were still there working, and the weather was sunnier than ever. I felt sad for them so I immediately went over to a random shop and bought 2 cold drinks, I walked over, tapped their shoulder and handed the drinks to them. Despite their face being covered by face mask, I could see that they were surprised and thankful. One of the guys thanked me in Chinese so I presumed that they were foreign workers. I didn’t put much thought into it, said welcome and then went off.A few days ago, I was doing my usual grocery run around the area around evening time and someone tapped me on my shoulders. I turned around and I couldn’t recognize the person, but he told me that he recognized me as the person who bought them drinks when they were working under the hot sun last week. We had a quick chat and he told me that he used to work as a technician in a small company and had been working for more than 10 years. He was laid off when the 1st PH2A kicked in, so he had no choice but to take this construction job asap as he was the sole breadwinner and he needed to send money back to his family in Malaysia. He was lowly educated (I think it was O Level) hence a similar job’s wage in Malaysia is barely sufficient for his own family, let alone his parents. Losing his job was depressing enough and the borders remaining shut is making it worse because if he wanted to visit his family, there would be no coming back, mainly due to the fact that it is likely the company will cancel his work pass and no employer is willing to pay for quarantine fees. He said that he was thankful for my kind gesture and it helped with his depression, he tried to return me money for the drinks but obviously I didn’t take it. Before he left, he thanked me again for lending him a listening ear. For once I actually felt grateful for what I have now. I am sure there are many others out there who are severely affected and although they are not homeless, they are definitely struggling, just that we may not be able to see it. I wished I could have done more to help. If only everyone can be kind to each other, not necessarily through money but something as simple as lending a listening ear to others, or other simple gestures like holding the door or even giving up seats to those who need it (more often than not elderly seniors would thank you for it).

I was initially very fixated with the idea of finding a serious relationship. I dated one guy for a few months even though I knew he wasn’t looking for anything serious. I held on to it as I didn’t have anyone else I fancy and also I thought that time would change his mind. obviously, that didn’t happen and we eventually ended things. After that, I went on to meet many other guys. Out of those guys I’ve met, I was only interested in 1 or 2 but my interest eventually also faded off. Now, I’m starting to wonder if I just have bad luck in my love life or if I’m just not ready for a relationship. On hindsight, I wouldn’t have stuck with the first guy who wasn’t even serious about me if I was looking to settle down. Maybe it was societal pressure that compels me to want to find a serious relationship? Also, it’s very superficial of me but I also feel that many a times I’m lowering my standards when matching with or talking to guys on dating apps simply because the pool of guys on apps is not that great…-#98895: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98895",56,6,0,7,7,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

Any police officers or lawyers here please help me..Recently my parents and I have been in what I would describe a dispute with a shop. The shop has closed down recently (they used to have a physical outlet in a mall). The dispute includes them (bosses of the shop) keeping our money that was meant for a package. They claimed that as the package had expire therefore no refund (few thousand dollars). However my parents and I was still allowed to use the package even after the expiry date before they closed down (they have accidentally showed us the signature card with the dates that service was provided). I know it is my fault for trusting them but is it entirely my fault? How am I supposed to remember everything. They also keep blame it on the service staff who we have no contact with since the shop is close. The service staff probably is only there to work, can they be held liable?We tried to explain our point of view to them but they refuse to come to a conclusion and did not want to refund a single cent. I don’t know how packages work as I am a male and not to stereotype but I thought the money should auto refund when the package is up? Correct me if I am wrong….To add on, they did not inform anyone of the closure. I went down one day and saw it closed. I did see some others who were standing outside confused as well.I am very puzzled about it and wanted to report to the police but I was told from my police friends that the police will most likely not do anything about it.

#98889,7/7/2021,"I am a 27 (F) working in the town area. I would rate myself decent-looking and have had several ex-es who looks pretty good. A month back my company hired a new colleague who is 28 (M). My first impression towards him based on his appearances weren’t very good to be honest. He is not very tall (16-ish), nerdy-looking with an outdated hairstyle. He always goes out to lunch alone, probably because he’s shy and have not blended in yet. I tried my best to avoid him around work (I felt so guilty right now about that) but because of work-related issues, I can’t avoid him completely. There were times he consulted me and I had to teach him. Only just very recently, out of total coincidence, I found out his daily routine during our lunch break and after work. There will always be an old aunty selling tissues in a corner during lunch break and she always almost get ignored by the passer-bys, but this colleague of mine, he always gets her a cup of coffee/hot milo and buys her tissue packs at an overpaid price. I saw this while I was behind him heading to the same place for lunch. He would even tell the aunty he will be back later after work to see her. I was astonished. I later found out he literally does that everyday he is in the office. The packs of tissues purchased are now all stacked up neatly in his drawer. There was also another incident at work whereby he got reprimanded for doing the wrong things. I soon realised what he did were actually all instructed and taught by me. I thought he would tell on me but he just kept quiet throughout the entire lecture. When he came out, I hurriedly went over to apologise and all he said was, ‘it’s okay’ and gave me a wide smile. That was one of the brightest and genuine smile I have seen in my entire life. I feel that I have developed feelings for him although his appearances is entirely not my type. I feel that I can actually bypass all these judgemental impressions of mine of a person because of his character for the first time in my life. Please tell me how do I make my feelings known for him in a subtle way? I don’t think he has much confidence in himself and would definitely not be the one to initiate or confess. For the rest of the ladies out there, please take my heed. Looks are only temporal. What stays is the heart and mind.

#98921,5/7/2021,"I really empathize with OP #98845 on regretting studying Architecture. It's been close to five years since I've graduated and the salary of my peers and myself are stagnant at below 4.5k. Even the best of my peers, unable to climb in the field, have left to do something else, due to the unsustainable long working hours in practice. In contrast, peers from other disciplines move ahead in their careers, with salary increments - with far lesser working hours.Even my peers who have received their Architect license are not seeing any monetary reward whatsoever.I think what those people, who have never studied Architecture (or people considering studying Architecture) should understand - is that our 5 years of investment in education does not get any sort of return in value. There are also very little to no alternatives (besides Entrepreneurship) - with an Architecture degree in hand. It's simply too specialized and too much  cost (time spent -5 years) to make a U-turn elsewhere.People might gaslight and virtue signal saying - its not about the money - and ""passion triumphs"" and all that, but at the end of the day, Architecture is a really unsustainable career choice.

#98918,5/7/2021,"TLDR: I don’t want to give money to NUS Annual Giving because it sponsors Scholarships that benefit those who are already rich.I think this opinion would be unpopular and some would say would be detrimental to those less fortunate who could really benefit from the NUS Annual Giving. However, I m going to say it anyway and let the dice roll.I graduated from a faculty where my batch had the tuition fees pegged at about $10k per year. It is amongst the most expensive in NUS. When I matriculated, I found friends in my faculty who resided in landed/private property and/or are given their own vehicles, who were also awarded scholarships by NUS.My point being that those already from well-off families are given an additional push with monies that would have come from the NUS Annual Giving. Heck, I have no issues with them being wealthy because the Almighty or whatever favored them but the system could do more to help those from less fortunate households with scholarships than the already rich.On the other hand, I have been told that scholarships reward the smart ones (regardless rich or poor) to ease their studies. Alternatively, to attract the brightest minds with financial incentives. But hey, you want recognition (either for the institution through its intelligent cohorts or for the student), that’s good, but not at the expense of those who want to give money to those who actually need it.Ultimately, I could be wrong but my personal interactions suggest there is a need to re-look at the criteria to award scholarships.

In fact, one of the principals often compared us to the “neighbourhood” school next door, saying that our “bad” behaviour (e.g. BGR, lateness, untidy hair) are like GANGSTERS and HOOLIGANS like the school next door.

Sure, it is a stable profession, but I find myself dragging myself to work everyday, working really long hours (think 8 to 10 or later with no visibility as to when the workload and working hours will get back to normalcy), and I'm not sure if it's because of the state of languishment I am in as a result of covid, how the line between work and personal life is blurred due to covid or I'm just really tired of climbing up the corporate ladder. Taking extended leave seems out of the question given the firm is rather shorthanded these days and there's no appetite to hire more. The 1-2 days of leave that i try to take every now and then doesn't help when people still expect you to attend calls and respond to emails because everything is ""urgent"" because of the nature of work that i do.However, i do not really want to quit my job and YOLO like what others are doing because I grew up fairly poor and I know money is important, especially in Singapore. Besides, I have no hobbies or interests that excite me to potentially monetise the hobby or interest and quit my career for good.

But according to the medical personnel, i am not having an allergic reaction.Honestly, i am really afraid to take the second dose as many said that the reactions will be more severe. I am planning to consult my family doctor, but most likely he may say that he is unable to advise, and will ask me to consult the medical personnel on site when i take my second dose.

All these while, he has been learning about trading, but yet did not provide any income for the family, with my mum being the sole breadwinner. Even though he is a retiree, he never help to do housework, only do when being asked but complains all the time nor play a role as a father/filial to our grandparents, and curses everyday in front of the computer.Right now, his bank account is zero, even though he has received a small sum of his CPF money at 55. You must wonder how he has the money to pay the scammers despite getting scammed so many times. At his last resort, he reached out to his friends to borrow money. He will be receiving 50k next month from his father CPF account as he had passed away recently. Our last warning to him is, hope he can use the money well, and stop giving away the money to the scammers.

There are fewer people in Johor than in Singapore. It shouldn’t be difficult to finish vaccinations in Johor as a way of getting them started on the path to economic recovery while the Malaysian government continues to work on the more difficult cases up North.

(Heard that it was given to students in the past before I matriculated in AY2020/2021, but is only available for certain student leaders now).To put things into context, I've only attended 1.5 physical modules in school in Y1 (out of 11 modules), the rest were all online classes. And as a FASS student, all my modules thus far are assignment-based, which means I have MANY group projects to work on. Does it make sense that all our group discussions finish in 40mins (which is the time limit for free Zoom users)? In fact, the need to constantly log in and out of Zoom is just such a distraction for our discussions.To compare, SMU and NTU students (not sure about the other universities) are ALL given Zoom premium accounts, and they have more physical classes than us NUS FASS students... Furthermore, with the school fees that I pay that permits me to use the school facilities, I don't even use them, since I attend classes at home anyways. The lack of use of NUS physical facilities can probably cover a Zoom Premium subscription?PLEASE PLEASE NUS, could we get Zoom premium access?

Most of his emails contain newsletters, subscriptions, and all the nonsensical stuff that we all have. However, he does receive many grab receipts as he takes grab quite often.

#98837,30/6/2021,"A big question has been on my mind lately.. Should I subject myself to being a 'house slave', which means working my ass off and reduce my quality of life just to afford a more expensive house, which is likely a good investment 10-30yrs down the road. It is really worth it? If I sell my HDB, it would mean that I will be making a profit of around 150k cash after deducting the loans, fees etc. Due to personal reasons, I will not be able to purchase another HDB flat. Hence, a resale Condo is my only choice. While I personally love the lifestyle of living in a Condo and enjoying the facilities, I would lose the physical living space as it will be a lot smaller. On top of that, I would have to fork out a lot more money for the monthly installment. I will likely lose the luxury to travel comfortably every year (once Covid settles) or splurge on expensive items/meals whenever I feel like it. I wouldn't be able to save much and if I want more money I would have to find ways to earn it, which translates to working more & working harder. As things are getting more expensive now, having a good long-term investment also seems essential to a more stable and comfortable retirement. And of course, enjoying the daily comfort of life while I'm young enough since there is really nothing much to look forward to nowadays. I believe it's all subjective, and there's no right or wrong.

TM doesn't really govern me that much and leaves it to AM to train me instead. Thing is, AM is really shifty and hard to get hold of becaus she is frequently having long(-winded) talks with other people.

Days stretched into weeks. And she only replies to the questions which she wants to. I can only get all the answers I need if we get into a video call initiated by her and I can sit her down to ask.

Prior to that, he wasnt actively trying to plan the meetup but i just brush that aside since i believe that was his communication style and i dont want to push things further (or maybe he just wasnt into me idk) He did apologise for oversleeping, but i just felt that for a first meetup, you should at least have the basic manners not to be late etc. (In the event that he is hesitant in the meetup, he could have told me so, hence i dont think by accepting someone invitation then dismissing it is very nice). I wasnt even asking much from this relationship, all i wanted was someone who can respect me and is willing to communicate when things gets tough rather than avoiding it. Eventually, we did not meet.

Things was actually going well before this, as we do have some common topics to talk about. But of course there are times when he is selective about the things he is replying. From a female pov, when we are sharing our day with you, it means that we like you and just want to hear from you too. But sometime he just brush things off and continue his topic which i know wasnt intentional as he is busy. (To clarify, i did not spam him w message as i am aware of how annoying it can gets esp when we are working) I have dated and met guys before him, but none of them stood me up like he does. I did try to think from his pov, his reason was that he is tired which i can understand.

#98820,29/6/2021,"I have been noticing a pretty mean-spirited mindset/movement that is becoming more and more prevalent in society nowadays, especially amongst the younger generations - that the standard of local guys is much lower than that of local girls and thus men here don't ""deserve"" local girls. To qualify it, the term 'standard' generally means attractiveness. I know that views like this that are widely spread  on social media may not really represent the majority of the female/male demographic here in Singapore, but is it really true? As a heterosexual guy who has travelled to majority of the asian countries and some western countries, I personally think that local guys are actually pretty good looking and decent at worst, but then again my view might be skewed lol-#98820: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98820",31,1,0,0,3,19,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
#98819,29/6/2021,"Admin please submit this I really need some advice . Thank you. Hi everyone please correct me if I am wrong but there is something I would like to share and see different views on it. I recently joined the working world (4mth). The firm I work at is very different from what my friends are working in. Recently my manager was scolded so badly I feel Like puking every time I enter the office is this normal? I mean everyone makes mistakes but there is no reason to scream  at them telling them that they are stupid or like they should just Fk off or what is the point of wearing specs when they can't see shit. I am literally using the words that were used. The whole office heard and was scolded like 5 times in the end turned out my manager was right and was scolded for nothing. I am not sure if any apologies were made but since then my manager is a different person. I keep thinking that I would not like to work for a company that treats their employees bad but the job market is bad and I am not sure if I should move? I can't do my work well since then and I am badly affected by it. Could you please give me some advice? I can't ignore what happened, every time my manager enters partners office we all just wait for her to scream, no one dares to talk in the office while she is there and even though its WFH she somehow is there everyday.We don't even ask questions because we are afraid.

#98818,29/6/2021,"My ex-GF and I has been together for a year. Met online on a dating portal. I felt that everything was great about the relationship - I loved her and she loved me. We never quarreled even once. I pay for food and experiences 95% of the time (except for times she insisted really hard), I drive her home after dates at my place, I order grabfood to her house for everyone in her family and I even offered to help her with her work when I saw that she was really stressed out.That's not to say we didn't have disagreements. She would say that she disagreed with some of the things that I've done and some of the choices that I made. Although she disagreed, she did mention that she can see how I've arrived at those decisions. She cited a few incidents: 1) While we were out walking, we saw a man lying on his side on the ground. Beside him stood 3 to 4 people, most likely his friends and family. My ex wanted to go over and give that person CPR but I thought it was too risky (cos it was COVID season right now) and the guy already looked like he has the necessary help (rolled to his side and the people around him called an ambulance already). She disagreed with my choice of action to not help.2) While crossing the road outside a petrol kiosk, a car nearly drove into my knee because the driver was on his phone. I thumped the car hood (natural reflex) and jumped away. Didn't leave a dent on the car. Ex thought I was being aggressive. I dont want to generalise, but wouldn't the emotions of someone who loves you be worry instead of judging you?3) At the cafe ordering food, the cashier skipped my ex and I in the queue to serve someone behind us. When it finally came to our turn, I asked the cashier why did she skip us? The cashier gave us a generic answer and I told her that she wasnt being fair to us. I let it go at that. My ex thought that I was being too confrontational when I was just letting the cashier know that people who are queuing do not appreciate being glossed over.Recently, she went out with her male colleague for Friday dinner 1 on 1 at a posh  cafe. When she mentioned this to me, I did highlight my disapproval but I did not want to make her decisions for her. I questioned whether this dinner was necessary. She replied that it was with a colleague. On the way to the dinner, she texted me that she was wearing a new dress to the dinner and she thought it looked cute. I asked for a photo and she gave me a photo taken in the reflection of the MRT glass window after a few hours and late into the night. I couldnt even see anything clearly in that photo.Fast forward 1 week, she decided to break up with me and stated that I was not what she wanted. She wanted a ready-made man and I was not it. She confessed that there were 30 year olds who had interest in dating her (including that colleague she met for dinner). Questions and comments: 1) What does a ready-made man mean? I'm in the financial industry with pretty good career options going ahead. I am a responsible and loyal guy who just wants to provide the best to my family. To that end, I am starting some side hustles for extra income too. I am earning lesser than my ex currently but this was because of NS and I spent more time studying (I have an overseas masters degree that was self funded).2) She said she loved me but she would have to break up with me. I disagree with this. I think she merely liked me for my utility and not as a person. Life need not be a Korean heartwrenching drama.3) I felt really disgusted that the reason she told me for breaking up was all the disagreements that were brought up multiple times. This is clearly a big deal for her whereas I thought these were immaterial to the relationship because I've explained the context and thought she understood it. It felt like the whole relationship was a pretense and her love for me was fake.Oh well, sometimes in life you win some, sometimes you lose some. I got my closure and I deserve someone better. I just hope that she wouldn't live to regret this. She might prefer a ready made man, but what could she offer a ready made man that will make him keep her? Obviously not emotional connection because she doesn't value that in our relationship.My two cents.

#98813,29/6/2021,"I'm not looking for advice. I just wanted to get this off my chest. Earlier this year, a colleague and I started an online get together for people in our industry. Since then it seems to have turned out pretty well. We had pretty good attendance at our events and people seemed to be learning new things, enjoying themselves and making connections. Over the past few months there have also been a consistent group of regulars who go above and beyond to volunteer with us. Anyway one of these volunteers is a woman I'll call X. She was quite quiet at first and her background was abit different than most of the other people who attended. She would attend these online events, listen quietly and then leave quietly. I only began to notice her more when she began to volunteer to do more things. I don't want to say too much about what she would do because that would make it too obvious but there was one particular thing she helped to organise that just super impressed me. I got to know her a lot better through working on this thing because it was quite intense, so a group of us would stay up quite late chatting and discussing how to go ahead with certain ideas. X came across as being very sharp, very smart, but also she just has this like quiet charm or something that makes people want to work with her. and its like she never runs out of energy. People just enjoy working with her because she's caring and also decisive without being pushy. She's super on the ball, and I'm not sure how to explain but she's v enthusiastic and committed without being ""in your face"". I've actually never met her in person but I found myself having a huge attraction to her. She has a great smile, super articulate and has a great career ahead of her. We became FB friends and I found out she's very happily married to a lucky guy. I'm not an idiot and I won't do anything stupid but I just wanted to tell someone about this. This will probably pass eventually. I had to stop myself from texting her just to chat about things and pretending it was about something we were working on because I just enjoyed talking with her so much. Maybe I'm reading too much into this....but she would be very polite also and just end the conversation gently if it was going on too long and no longer about work. She probably knows. I don't think she reads this but yah, glad we know each other at least and hope to continue to see her around...-#98813: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98813",13,3,0,6,3,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

She say she can't live with my double standards. She say I only do things when I want to.Due to the recent spike in covid cases, my parents told me not to go out. My gf asked if we want to go try a new hawker stall. I told her what my parents said and she just exploded. She said she can understand my parents concerns but then she say she is angry at me for hiding behind my parents. According to her. I always use my parents as a shield and she can't stand it. She thinks it's rude and unfillal. She said I'm pushing the responsibility to my parents instead of taking account for my own actions. What's the difference? Why she angry? What I told her was the truth.Continuing from the last para, I rejected her jio to go out eat and then I told her I spent my whole day at the library. She angry again. She ask why I scared of covid still can go lib whole day then cannot hang out with her? What's the link? Then she go on to say how I only put in effort when I want to. I am sian of her liao to be honest. I'm sick of all these negative energy. Then she angry at my eating habits. I don't like too much veggie. I don't like melted cheese. I don't like raw fish. I don't eat spicy and I don't eat steak (nth religious. I just don't like the texture). So we never eat Korean food, sushi, pizza, nice salad or went to a fancy steak restaurant. .

According to my gf, she say that's bcus no one bothers to tell me bcus no one cares or at least no one sees hope in me, except for her. But I guess that's her opinion?

#98803,28/6/2021,"My spouse has recently joined a contract job (after a LOT of struggle in finding one) here in SG and is going through a terrible and traumatising time to say the least.[If no time to read a long post, pls go to the end “Closing” section]***First, some background about the job***The job requires staff to be logged in EXACTLY by a particular time - not even a minute later. If so, people start enquiring if something is wrong. The job entails working on a number of task items (using a generic word here to not give too much of a hint about the company) throughout the day, keeping in mind to complete each task item in a reasonable amount of time, and without quality issues. There is a quality checker at the end and there is an allocated lead who is supposed to be guiding the new hires complete their task items. At the end of each month, analysts are ranked based on how many task items they completed in a month and how many quality errors were assigned to them.There was a 3 week training prior to her (and others who were hired together with her) actually starting on the job - after which analysts were given LIVE task items to work on.A typical day actually sees her rushing through her bath and early morning routine and then jumping onto the chair somehow to start her day. Then she BARELY gets any time throughout the day to take a breath or look around, until she actually logs off. I provide her breakfast, keep the lunch warmed up before she gets the highly measured 30 mins break and help her with her snacks and tea, if any - because she really does not get any break.***Now, something about her and the job***She has had to pick up this job because she really has not been getting ANY interview calls at all - thanks to the recent rule changes due to Covid and hiring being focused on locals. Not a single role in her area of expertise was willing to sponsor an EP for her, citing hiring norms. And then this contract job came by a few months back and they were willing to hire her.The skills required for this job are something she has a bit of, but not a whole lot of. But even then, I have seen her try real real hard and come up to a particular level of speed and comfort which was not there when she started. The other thing this job needs is agility - they want people to be very fast. This is also something she is not the best at with the given skills, but I have seen a great deal of improvement from when she started out.***Now, the issues she is facing***The team lead that she is allocated to talks pretty rudely and insensitively to her and keeps calling out when she asks questions - he’ll either be condescending and ask her to read up reference material before raising questions, or he will cross question in a rude manner and end up making it look like she asked a silly question that she was supposed to know the answer to. The same team lead, when talking to another analyst (how she knows this is because the conversation between the lead and other analysts go on in a common group chat which every team member can see) goes out of his way to suggest solutions and provides clarifications even before that analyst could ask, and in cases when that analyst does ask, he has a plethora of answers ready for her - the whole conversation going on in a very normal and civilised manner.Every now and then, he and other team leads keep poking her about her speed and the kind of questions she asks.All this has not only led her to become extremely sad and upset, it has also led her to start believing that she is worthless and not valuable enough. She has lost self-confidence and as vicious a cycle as it is, her speed has slowed down even more and errors have increased.After the month of May, they told her that her performance was not that great. After the month of June, her performance was much better than what it was in May, but rather than motivating her to be better, they put her into an “Improvement Plan” , which is a more glorious way of saying “your performance is poor and we are monitoring you closely now”.This was a major setback for her and I have seen her cry at her work desk many a times - she does try to keep up a strong front, but at the end of the day it IS human to feel bad because of such unreasonable behaviour and bad treatment meted out.Must point out here that there are a couple of other leads with whom she has worked for a couple of days and had realised that they were very very different from the leads with bad management quality. However, the way this company is run (like an authoritarian place), she asking for a change of lead will not only be turned down, but could also fire back at her in a bad way. Hence she is wary of doing that.�***Closing***Basically, rather than nurturing and motivating an analyst who is trying real hard to keep up with the rat-race, they are being extremely insensitive and condescending and killing that person’s morale more and more.She is unable to take a step and leave this job because she knows that as a foreigner in SG, she will not get another one. But this job is REALLY taking a toll on her mental health and eventually physical health too.NOTE: Raising this to Sr Management is also something she is wary of because (a) being a contract employee she does not have much of a reach/say, (b) the management may be hands-in-glove with what is being meted out to her, in which case she will fall into even deeper trouble, (c) after getting beaten around so much, she has started feeling that she is indeed bad at what she does.-#98803: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98803",14,3,0,3,0,15,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

We spoke thereafter and he said he understood my pov and will not do it again.Also, when we are texting back and forth and somehow a topic or subject that he doesn't like crops up, he would go MIA (i.e. bluetick) and reply hours later. This happened on multiple occasions and each time he apologises and promise it wouldn't happen again.We are both in our late 20s and I don't really want to seek another relationship.

Worse still, whenever we're spending time together (watching netflix/shows/etc) and one of her idols started streaming suddenly, she'll switch over to watching that, leaving me to do my stuff alone. Another time when we're out for dinner on a date, her idol started streaming out of nowhere and I could tell that she seems really disappointed that she couldn't watch his stream since we're out.I've tried talking to her about this matter but she just brushes it off as I'm being childish and insecure.Am I really wrong for making such a big fuss out of this?-#98795: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98795",44,10,0,4,19,24,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
#98794,28/6/2021,"Guys are often bewitched by the good figures of the opposite sex because these physical traits of slim body, big busts, long legs and big hip can be really sexually stimulating. I find this rather sad for us ladies that even if we get turn on by good-looking/muscular men, we can never know about their real sexual performance in bed. So many times... I got schemed by ""how monster they can be under the sheets"" and later only turned out to be a couple minutes of brief enjoyment. They love to pull out this ""you are too hot"" explanation to defend themselves.You see the difference? However attractive they are, I don't get to experience the same level of excitement once their tools couldn't operate anymore. While I get disappointed over such encounters, it's those dudes who are skinny or less flattering in their looks surprise me the most during the deeds. Sometimes I even think back and revisit the scenes of our intimate engagements.So please do not judge if you see a couple with mismatching appearance.... especially for guys... they might perform better than your 2/10 wiener!-#98794: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98794",59,19,0,0,99,69,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#98791,28/6/2021,"Hi, I'm a girl so, I just wonder if the other girls out there think the same as I do.I have a good friend who is a closeted gay guy. He isn't out for many reasons such as societal and parental pressures. For all his life, he has had a few discreet relationships with guys but recently, he told me he wants to try dating a girl and has been seeing a girl for a few weeks now. He says it's been going very well and he could see her as a ""potential partner"".So here are my concerns:1. He broke up with his ex not too long ago and told me he often cry thinking about him. So, isn't dating anyone now gonna be a rebound?2. I told him that he can't be selfish to date a girl becos of ease of accountability to society. He needs to be transparent with the girl about his attraction to guys and his past same-sex relationships. But he says its his problem and none of my business. 3. Knowing him for 3 years, his thinking can be really immature and irrational, which is why I'm constantly tryna remind him about repercussions since I care about him and the ppl he dates. Now girls (or maybe guys), if you're the girl he's seeing right now, would you want your date to be upfront honest about themselves esp. if they're not straight? If you guys do become a couple, do you deserve to be cheated on becos your BF can't stop thinking abt guys? I mean, if you're okay with dating a gay guy, you would at least expect him to be honest abt it, isn't it? I'm his good friend and I am concerned about his feelings, but he can be so obstinate and delusional... I just hope the girl will not be shortchanged too greatly. To XX, if you're seeing this, I hope you'll think about this carefully.-#98791: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98791",17,1,0,0,6,13,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#98785,28/6/2021,"TLDR, It’s gonna be a long rant and I’m hoping to get some helpful advice especially from those who have similar experiences. My ex-bf and I knew each other since our poly days and we have been together for 2 years before we broke up a few days before Christmas last year. Although I personally feel that he is mature enough at this age, but somehow some of the things that he did kinda contradict what I think of him. Take for example, he is a filial son and a role model to his 2 younger siblings, and he listen to his parents, obeys house rules, though he isn’t exactly a mommy boy, but at outside, he would hangout with the wrong bunch of friends, he sometimes do things emotionally like buying things that he doesn’t need. When he initiated the breakup, I was quite shocked because I didn’t know he is that bad to such extent that he got to breakup with me, and the reason is because he feels that he doesn’t deserve me.I confronted him and asked him is it because of his friend’s influences, but he said no, it was his own decision. TBH he wasn’t that bad when we were still together, but his bad side only started to show up a few months prior to our breakup. He started skipping classes by giving many excuses though most of the classes were conducted online. He spent less time with me because he wanted to do things with his friends. When I was unhappy with him, he yelled at me and sometimes even hung up my call when we were talking halfway through the phone. Even when I was kind enough to accompany him to study on weekends, he complained that I shouldn’t be there because I was a distraction, but actually most of the time he was either on his mobile game or lying on his bed, not study. He just became that bad until I asked myself whether this guy is still worth keeping or not. What’s worst is that on my birthday, he only wished me after he woke up in the morning, he didn’t have time to meet me for a lunch or dinner, and only passed me a present at night, but he actually went hiking with his coursemates. I was angry about it but he said they already planned it long time ago so he couldn’t reject them. I told my close friends about it, I cried to them, and all of them urged me to break up with him, but before I was ready to do so, he did it first.What surprised me was that the breakup hit me very hard at first, but a few days later I felt better because I know I deserved better. We stopped texting or calling each other for almost half a year. I was so hurt by him during that 4-5 months until I didn’t feel like being hurt again, so after that I just focused on my studies and just graduated. So what really shocked me is that last week he texted me to patch back. I didn’t reply him because I don’t think I should give him a second chance, but he has been trying very hard for the past week. He messaged me non-stop every night and day, and all his messages are essay-long, telling me what he missed out in our relationship, what he did wrongly, his regrets for hurting me, etc. Occasionally I’m tempted to reply him or picking up his call, but I still didn’t do it cos I don’t know what to do, and I don’t know whether it’s right to give him another chance.  I actually heard from our mutual friends that he doesn’t hangout with that bunch of friends anymore, I’m not sure why but I have a feeling that maybe he realized his mistakes and they are just bad influence to him. In all his messages, he assured me he will not repeat the same hurtful things that he did to me. His church friends are also my friends, and they told me that he is also single since we broke up.Guys, I think if he is just 23 year old and was misled by the wrong group of friends, but he seems very sincere to me. I still love him despite those hurtful acts he did to me, and I really miss those sweet moments that we used to have. Once in a while I also cry when I read his texts cos when we were together, he didn’t send me any long messages, but now he spends so much time to write these messages just to patch back with me, and I can imagine how much effort he must have put in. I’m actually ready to give him a second chance but I will warn him for sure if he still do the same thing again, there will be no more chance in future. What do you think guys?-#98785: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98785",34,5,0,5,3,20,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

#98783,28/6/2021,"Can anyone give me advice on how to deal with my marriage? I am 37 this year, married to my husband who is 39, for 10 years after 8 years of courtship. We have 2 children together, age 4 and 2. My marriage seems to be alright on the surface but there are many incidents that happen beneath our supposedly strong union. I came from a low income family with 1 older sister and a younger brother, my sister is married. My parents did not have much savings and they are still paying for their house instalments for their flat. I only get to know about how my parents got by through my sister’s husband when he was complaining about tightening their finances when they are earning a combine income of more than 11k per month without car and their house fully paid for. Their contributions goes to the house instalment and monthly expenses. I realized that my own contribution pales to them but my husband suggested that I pass my parents cash infront of everyone to show that we contributed. My younger brother who is in his late twenties could not help out as he could not land a job to support himself as he only wants a job that is cushy and only requires talking but high salary despite only being a diploma grad. The reason to why my finances is tight, because we took out a max loan to finance a 3 bedroom condo so that my husband can feel good in front of our family members and friends. He works as a logistic executive drawing around 3k without allowance and I worked as a chemical quality engineer drawing close to 5k. To most ppl, a combine income of 8k seems to be just nice to finance a condo, given that we have worked for more than 10 yrs individually and should have accumulated a good amount of CPF and savings. However, my husband’s job only start to have CPF allowance about 9 years ago and we paid for our BTO using mostly from my CPF account. We barely hit the minimum CPF deposit despite wiping out our CPF OA for the condo deposit but we received a decent amount of cash proceeds from the sales of the house. Despite the surplus of cash, during my second pregnancy, I was not allowed to go to a private hospital and gynae as my first pregnancy was quite tiring when we opt for public hospital and with a 4 bedder room. I was not able to rest properly and had to put up to it. When I saw my older sister’s both pregnancy at a private hospital with round the clock care by nurses and gynae, it makes me feel very low to why I could not afford such simple luxury when I am able to but had to channel my finance to other areas.It has been decided by my husband that the condo will be used for rental, as our salary could not afford the cash instalment but we are currently facing difficulty getting a good rental in such market due to covid. Therefore, we had to move back to my husband’s parents place which was hellish for me before we move to our HDB. I was treated like a maid but need to contribute to the household expenses. As my husband is the eldest of his four siblings, but the lowest educated and income, he often likes to treat his side of the family to meals worth hundreds of dollars to show off to his university educated siblings that he could afford despite being only diploma educated while his siblings enjoy the free food. To shoulder the expenses, he turn to illegal means and also use part of my salary. Holidays now is just a pipe dream for me as I could not afford to go for holidays as the money needs to be poured into his quest to showcase. The best I could do was a short trip to Malaysia. Whenever I see my sister’s family goes for holidays in Japan or Europe countries, I often feel very low and helpless. Even when my parents goes for holidays, my sister’s side will help to pay for their expenses and I could not help out much.Not sure if my standards are low, but I think my husband is still a decent person as he doesn’t visit KTV lounges, clubs before. Probably he doesn’t drink because he could not stomach alcohol. It’s just that he needs to be the best amongst his friends and family. He will always highlight the incompetence of his friends despite them being better off than him and require me to constantly reminding him of how good he is. I know that he dislike some of my relatives especially those younger cousins who dares to disagrees with him as well as those who are better than him to the point that he could not put down. I’m not sure what can I do about it as he can be very competitive in the area of ‘face’ as he simply cannot lose face and cannot be wrong at any occasion but he also refuse to improve on himself.

#98792,28/6/2021,"For those who are considering joining the real estate industry as a real estate agent; PLEASE I urge u to think twice. Especially if you’re leaving a stable salaried job to do this. Don’t be fooled by the posts of your friend posting their awards & fancy cars and shit on social media and think it’s so easy. It’s not. Don’t get brainwashed by the managers who are trying to recruit you that it’s such good money and that you can also do it. They earn an overriding commission from their team members so of course the more the merrier. My team manager makes $30-60k a month alone on his team overriding commission; and that’s on top of his own sales. Don’t forget that these people are highly skilled salesmen who can sell ice to eskimos. The reality is that only the TOP 1-5% of ALL agents make good money & the rest are barely making it. I am not exaggerating. The people in the Top 5% are making all the money. If you’re not in the Top 5%, u can totally forget about it. There’s over 30,000 agents in Singapore- u do the Maths. In my first 2-3years, I burned through all my hard earned savings on PropertyGuru credits (I think burned about 5k), various training courses (3k here and 6k there), various apps & misc expenses. Besides PropertyGuru, there’s also EdgeProp & 99.co- also need to buy credits. Another 20-30k burned on Facebook & Google Ads. In this industry you will burn a lot of money first (easily 20k or more in your first year) before u even make your first cent. If you do not have at least 12 months of expenses saved PLUS min $20k for all these necessary expenses, don’t even consider it. That’s not the worst part. Just because u burn money on PropertyGuru, Facebook & Google Ads doesn’t mean u will get genuine leads. 95% of all your leads are time wasters. They don’t respond when u contact them. Msg never reply. Or they will make appointment with you & then never show up. A lot of people who fill up your lead form on Facebook are just bored and have no genuine intention to sell or buy property. Cold leads from online marketing are almost impossible to close. Most of them are just “look see only”. I spent over $20k to learn this the hard way. Don’t be like me. I cannot tell u how many times people have flown my plane. I travel down to the location and waited for an hour & the person never show up. If you’re a woman, you’ll constantly get harassed by nuisance calls and texts by random male strangers. Because our contact number is readily available online, many men will think it’s okay to take your number and abuse it freely. Pretend to be a buyer interested to buy property, and then after wasting your time for hours, ask if you’re single. Everyday I will get at least one dodgy text or DM from some creepy anonymous male stranger on various platforms. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. This year after deducting expenses, not only did I not make any $$, I lost around $15-20k. It’s depressing to think that the people working in McD & cleaners actually earn more than me. The truth is- You’ll HATE the job UNLESS you’re a natural salesman who genuinely loves interacting with people. The key words being “GENUINELY LOVES”. I am an introvert, I hate going out, I hate interacting with people in general and I suffer everyday in this job. So please take my advice. Don’t do it. It’s very painful & not as lucrative as many people think. Most agents make around $50-100k a year? Might as well stick to a regular day job with CPF and benefits. The real perk is the security of knowing u have a fixed paycheck coming in every month. The dumbest thing one can do is leave a stable salaried job for this fucking “job” where U actually have to pay money to do shit U hate & talk to people u can’t stand, everyday going around for viewing after viewing after viewing like a free fucking tour guide.  People don’t care about wasting your time, cos you’re just an agent. Nobody will tell u this shit because frankly those who are struggling won’t admit to anyone they’re struggling, and the few who are doing very well won’t understand why you’re struggling. I just wish somebody had told me this shit years ago.-#98792: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98792",325,1000,0,83,45,537,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#98790,28/6/2021,"Starting my uni soon and I'm little anxious. My high school life has been not the best. While others went for parties and had graduation sleepovers, I was at home in the corner of my room. Graduation day was very quick. After the ceremony, I didn't bother to take pictures with anyone... since I didn't see the point of taking pictures with people who didn't give me any memories. I still remember how I cried that same day later evening... scrolling through the other pictures everyone else posted on Facebook, cheering and having fun, taking group shots, with teachers, parents and BFFs. My mother was the one who consoled me that night... That very day, I had alot of regrets in me... How could I have my school experience a better one? I should have talked to more people, maybe be a little more outgoing and stepping out of my comfort zone. I also realised I (the friends or acquaintances) I made were all the wrong ones, all toxic and of no benefit. Basically, high school was a failure (in terms of making long lasting friendships) for me - and this is the biggest regret in my life so far. I could have done better...Generally, I'm more of an introvert... but if I do meet anyone (and I am able to click with them) I can talk for a pretty long time... and I don't mind talking about problems people have and giving them advices... I guess being an introvert is difficult in a social world. The guys who I used to make friends with in school were toxic... they didn't want to see me change and come out of my comfort zone.

As you all might have known, COVID has caused some delays in the BTO construction. BTOs are already not easy to get under normal times. Currently, if I were to add up the whole process of balloting, selection, construction, renovation, moving etc, it will be at least 6 years optimistically before we can move in. We can also considered getting a resale flat but they are really more costly and the prices have gone up too. Due to our limited funds, we can only perhaps afford a 4 rm max in a non mature estate. I think that current prices of resale, we will not be making much profit, if any at all when we sell. I just hope that it won’t depreciate too much. I am also worried about the wear and tear that comes with a old flat. Is it a good idea to get a resale flat as the first house? Some background: our combined income around 9k. We are looking to stay in the medium term at least 8-10 years.

I wasn't able to get in a course I liked in a local uni. Also, I'm not a Singaporean so whether or not I study here or abroad is pretty much the same cost for me. My dad is a private hire driver and my mom isn't around at the moment. After going to the bank to get a study loan, my dad was found to be ineligible to sign as my guarantor as he doesn't earn much. Apparently for the overseas loan which I am enquiring for requires someone earning at least $7k-$8k/month to sign as my guarantor. During my poly studies, I've worked 2-3 jobs to support my family financially and to keep a roof over our heads. I manage to earn more than my dad and honestly, I was able to make ends meet with a sufficient amount in savings. But now, the stuggle to get a loan dropped like a bomb on me. I'm really starting to feel that no matter how hard I work, I'm always going to have financial problems. Because i was so work oriented during my poly years, I don't have much time for friends.. so now, I'm really struggling to find someone who earns $7-8k/month to sign as my guarantor and get this study loan for me as I dont have any other Singaporean/PR relatives here in Singapore.Taking a gap year is an option, but I would really want to get my studies over and done with quick so that I can fully focus on my career afterwards. Also, even if i were to take a gap year, I still wont be able to save up enough for my further studies any time soon so I'll end up needing a bank loan anyways. The uni course offer is quite a good offer as well.. it's one of the top 8 universities in the UK and with my poly grades, I am able to cut in as a Year 2 student for this 3 years course. (So overall a 2 year duration of studies for me, and for hons, so I really dont want to let this opportunity slip) Sucks to be poor i guess.-#98760: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98760",18,2,0,6,0,9,0,8,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

#98720,26/6/2021,"There have been much talk about racism recently and such sensitive topics inadvertently incite emotions and nationalistic sentiments among Singaporeans especially if they feel shortchanged in our society. As a patriotic Singaporean, I do feel strongly for my fellow countrymen and women when I hear and read stories about them being discriminated in the workforce by foreign expats who are landing on our shores in droves. Accounts such as locals receiving a lower salary as compared to expats for the same type of job, promotions and big salary packages are only reserved for certain nationalities/race, the list of grievances goes on. I have been working in an international bank for the past 5 yrs and the majority of my colleagues are foreigners from a variety of countries across different continents. When I first joined, it was immediately apparent that Singaporeans are the minority, we occupy mostly the lower, mid level jobs while the seniors are mostly foreigners and caucasian. It was really rare to see a local taking on a top job, in fact, none of the senior folks (MDs) in my department are Singaporeans. From this perspective, it would be extremely easy for me to put it down to pure discrimination and join the complain brigade about how our government has sold our country off to foreigners and foreign corporations for profit while throwing Singaporeans under the bus while telling us to continue to work hard. Having said that, I did reflect on the environment I was in and wondered if it was better to leave and seek greener pastures where Singaporeans are more appreciated or at least be treated on equal footing. However, I realised that things may not be as simple and straight forward as it seem. Intelligence wise, locals are definitely equal or even smarter than many foreigners I have come across, but when it comes down to pure performance, I would be lying if I were to say the same. I am not really sure why, but Singaporeans are a quiet bunch, they don't like to voice their opinions, give ideas, volunteer for projects, present a differing argument or even stand up for themselves when they are being wrongly accused (intentionally or unintentionally) about something. As someone holding a mid level position, I do try my very best to mentor the juniors, telling them not to be afraid put themselves out there as that's the best way to learn and grow but my advice normally fall on deaf ears. When they do leave the organisation after a year or two, the reasons are the pretty standard gripes about unfairness, lack of opportunities and discrimination. How often have I heard my Singaporean colleagues tell me that they hate networking, hate having small talk, hate having to present something in front of a crowd. ""Just leave me alone and let me do my work in peace"", they said. Especially in a large international organisation where people from all over the globe fight to stand out amongst the crowd, can someone who just wants to do their job in peace and quiet expect to be recognised and rewarded more than another who dares to risk embarrassment and making mistakes in a bid to exceed expectations and differentiate themselves from the rest? Of course, the above is not representative of every Singaporean in all areas of society, it is just my observations in my work environment. Although I doubt this will change anytime soon, I do hope that some  day I will be able to witness our young Singaporeans grow and develop into leaders with a global mindset ready to interact with foreigners on an equal footing.-#98720: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98720",15,5,0,0,0,73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We have been together for 15 years and we love each other very much but we have never had sex.In the fifth year of marriage I was posted for a short stint in Thailand. There, I saw many pretty women. I wanted to control my urge to go for them to replace the sex I never had. But something told me in my mind that I will be cheating on her. I love her a lot and I did not want to see her cry. It will break my heart. So I decided to go with my original flow before I met her. I used to dress up as a woman. So I bought cosmetics and dressed and dressed up and went to one of those illigal backlane shops where you walk in as a male and walk out as female. There is certainly some risk due to it being illigal but mine went well. Some 8 months later when I came back to Singapore, I told her about it. She did not mind. We are still happy together. In fact, I feel that the bond is stronger after my gender transformation surgery. In August 2021 we will be celebrating our 16th anniversary. What I will say is that marriage need not mean sex. Couples can still be happy without sex and children. The happiness comes from love and acceptance. Just cuddling close together everynight feels like heaven!

Truth to be told, I was a little fond of him at one point of time, but the feeling (never strong) dissipated rather quickly. He was like an older brother (because he was older than a few months only lah haha)Recently though, he told me something which impacted for a bit. He told me that all his life, he has been experiencing gender dysphoria. She didn’t use the term lah - but from the way she described viz. lesbian trapped in a man’s body I am guessing its gender dysphoria? She is afraid to transition because of the cost (not only in monetary terms but like the real possibility of losing people, jobs and life as you know it). She is very much still in love with her fiancee. Of course, I had a barrage of questions on my mind. But I didn't want to offend her and instantly offered my support. I thanked her for telling me, and our friendship will never be affected in anyway by this piece of information. I may be a gay man and I have known people who are bisexual or lesbian, but truth be told I have next to no clue about transgender issues. I want to extend my support, but am not sure how. I know of shelters like TransBefrienders and T Project but I don’t think my friend would be able to tap on such services without outing herself. Do you know of anybody like that, and how/what kinds of support do they appreciate? I know of many closeted homosexuals but Im of the view that disguising your gender identity is a different ball game.-#98713: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98713",16,0,0,0,5,16,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

(AKA the girl that he tells me not to worry about)There was once, when he was in a gathering with his friends, his hot female bestie played and showed porn to everyone. There was no consent. My boyfriend felt extremely uncomfortable but he kept quiet as he was shy and didn’t dare to speak up. I was not present at the gathering.A little background of myself: I was diagnosed with PTSD last year. My trauma was related to sexual trauma.When I first found out about the porn incident from my boyfriend, I wasn’t affected yet as the triggers did not blow up back then. I shrugged the matter off.A few months later, my boyfriend started talking to me a lot about the vibrant sex life of his hot female bestie. Somehow, I just broke down immediately. I told him that she is really damn hot. I started to have flashbacks of the porn incident. Reflecting back on it, I felt damn uncomfortable. To me, when my partner watches porn with someone of the opposite gender, it is a crossing of boundaries. What’s more, he watched porn with the girl that he told me not to worry about. I was so afraid that my boyfriend may accidentally be turned on by his hot bestie, or fantasise about her.I started to have a lot of nightmares and flashbacks. The nightmares are uncomfortable to me as it’s about my boyfriend and his female bestie doing kinky sexual stuff together. Whenever I have such intrusive flashbacks and nightmares, I get so depressed and traumatised. I would cry the whole day. I lost all my self-confidence as well. At the same time, I felt super guilty for being affected by the porn incident only months after it occurred. I kept telling myself that “it’s his female bestie. Why should I worry? Why should I cry? It’s wrong to cry as it happened a while back.” I started blaming myself for being affected… after knowing that some ppl are okay with their partners watching porn with opposite gender friends.Is it wrong for me to be affected and cry only some time later?

Plus she already made plans to shift in with me when she retires lol (and I agreed liao siaogao what was i thinking). Actually I enjoy my mum companionship a lot. But there are times she get so unbearable and abusive. Like for example when she's in a bad mood, she will start to pack the house. She pack the house is her problem lah, but then she will start yelling at my siblings and I. She will yell at me for putting my half-finished bubble tea cup on the kitchen table. Or scream and shout about the pack of unopened M&Ms I put on kitchen table. And then she will grab everything and throw it inside my room. And the ironic thing is, when it's her stuff she just ignore lol. We have a bottle of coconut water and a box of agar jelly on the kitchen table (they're both hers), still not kept at the right places. The point is, when she's in a foul mood she will kpkb everyone else's stuff.Things are not good even when she's in a great mood. She gets excited and slaps me (because wfh i sit next to her at the desk lol kns then i kena the most). But doesn't matter because since young she hit me like nobody business so this is small thing. It does get annoying lah, when I'm focusing and I suddenly get slapped. Sometimes, I get damn dulan when she does this. Then I yell at her. How to give in? Out of 10 times, I can give in 7 times. The other 3 times I sure hot one. When I was younger when my hell of a stupid and tiko father was around, she will force me to sit there and witness their fights. Few times it got super violent. You all dunno lah, even catch the cb vixen also she drag me along. Oh btw, my dad cheated and is out of the equation now.

Commitment was the main thing they, as well as many guys nowadays, lack. My definition of commitment is very simple, there needs to be an understanding that once you decide to be with someone, you will be faithful to them until you die. I don’t want to have to hear all this crap about having platonic female friends whom you hang out with more than you hang out with me, or liking and following Instababes. I’m old-fashioned that way. Once you’re with me, you commit to me and I commit to you, forever. Otherwise the whole marriage/relationship thing is pointless.My husband has had a crush on me since we were in JC. He did not have a single girlfriend since he confessed to me then. We got together at the age of 28, 10 years after our awkward encounter as teenagers. I wasn’t even in his class. We just had a mutual friend. After JC we didn’t speak for a couple of years until we bumped into each other in Europe. That was when I realized maybe we were really meant to be with each other. And then our mutual friend told me he has been asking about me every time they met for 10 whole years. No he didn’t reach out to me for 10 years, and he said because he didn’t want me to be uncomfortable because I was always with someone else.So far, he has been the best husband any girl could ever ask for. He lets me do whatever I want, he supports me, he spends time with me, he insists that he washes the dishes, he does laundry, he irons my work clothes, basically he just trusts and loves me completely. Every morning, the first thing he does when I wake up is he will gently kiss me on my shoulder. He has done that every day since we moved in together. I don’t know man. I just know I’m never leaving him.I think sometimes we marry the people we love and other times we love the people we marry. With my husband, I think I fall in love with him a little more every day I’m with him and now I’m completely obsessed with him. I can’t sleep without having him next to me, and every time I go on overseas work trips for just a few days I’d cry in my hotel room because I’d just miss him so much.If you don’t find someone good, don’t waste your time.

#98679,22/6/2021,"I am feeling very lonely and feel really bad (I don't even know how to describe this feeling).This is a rant and duh, it is going to be very very negative. I suggest that you dont read this post.As a shy and introverted person in my early childhood, I have  always had problems making friends (even now). My appearance and background differs from the norm which made things much harder. As a means to an end, my way of avoiding alienation was to be nice and helpful to everyone. It also prevented me from getting bullied too much, especially when I was younger. In my mind, I was happy not getting bullied as much as before and I dont have to sit alone for recess. I continued this strategy throughout my life which in itself was a form of torture. The problem was that people would include me in their group because I brought value, was useful and helpful (studies, projects and sports). In reality, it is a struggle to connect with them and I never felt valued as a friend. When asked for an opinion, I used to give my opinion but it was constantly disregarded and sometimes, it would even result in conflict. Being the ""different"" guy, the rest of the group would be against me. After those experiences, my answers have been just ""anything"". As you may have guessed, all my friend circles that are purely guys. My experiences with girls have not exactly been great. I have always wanted to have a female friend. Not even talking about romantic relationships which by the way has been non-existent. Just looking for just good platonic friends. Whenever there are groups of guys and girls eating and happily chatting away, it made me feel really jelous. I did have girl class or school mates with whom I did projects with but most people just interact with me for the projects and then, nothing else. They would however, be good friends with my other guy friends. Then, it was uni time and I really hoped that people would be more mature. Hoped for a better friend circle in my faculty but it was the same crap all over again. I was in engine so again all guys. I was determined to change my future so I joined a CCA. There were both guys and girls and really hoped that I could make some awesome friends. The speech made by the president on the open session that the members will become as close as family made my hopes go up sky high. However, not many people interacted with me for the first few sessions and there were cliques starting to form. Tried joining some of the cliques but felt the resistance and awkwardness. In the end, just joined the other dudes were without any cliques because they joined late. Still positive, tried to make friends with them at least. They came in inconsistently so it was hard to be become close. I was still determined. As time went by, lesser people started to attend so there was no choice but to include me in their cliques. I did not let it go to waste. I would try to talk to everyone I met, be as genuine I could and be as positive as possible (be it guy or girl). The whole cca group dwindled down to a very small size. I kept going to the CCA despite the workload and even when there were only like 3 or 4 ppl turning up. Sometimes, people would not talk to me so I would take the initiative, approach them and talk. If it felt awkward, I would back off immediately or if the person seemed interested, then would try my best to have the best conversation possible. I was not making any close friends but the hope was that my effort would one day help me . Stayed in the CCA for about 1 year. There was not much progress. When everyone came into the room, they would sit beside people whom they want to interact with. That is just how it was. I would go in early but no one would sit with me. Only the last few people would sit beside me because there was just no space in other groups. Despite knowing everyone, it was extremely depressing to know that no one would want to sit with me unless the situation forced them into it. Then, it happened. We had an activity where we had to sit in a circle so everyone could see everyone else. The group was quite small. I was kind of ignored during the activity but that is still fine. Then, the activity was over but we still had some time so everyone was talking with each other. No one talked to me. I was so stunned. They know I was just there not interacting with anyone but no one cared. I was feeling tired that day so I did not initiate any conversation. For an hour, no one talked with me. I did not use my phone. I just sat there like a rock. When we went home, no one walked with me. I feel extremely terrible that day and even vomitted throughout the night. I stopped attending the CCA for a while. No one messaged me to ask at all. Although I was there through thick and thin for the CCA, no one bothered to message me. I already knew that members messaged each other so I dont see any reason why anyone wouldnt message me. One day, I saw the girl from my CCA walk past me in the canteen. She clearly saw me but did not even wave or try to acknowledge me. My heart sank so hard that it probably came out the other side of the world. I gave up trying and just focused on studies.I graduated and realised workplace is not exactly a place to make close friends. The environment is very different and when shit falls, it is every man for himself. It was the worst.I still meet up with sec classmates and uni mates but I feel that they are just asking me to come because I was already in the group. Some just call me to feel better because they know I am not doing well career wise despite being good at studies. I would say my work problems and they would be grinning away because they have higher pay and do not need to deal with terrible bosses. I dont meet up with my jc classmates because for some reason they stopped calling me out. However, I still know that they are in contact because they post pics on fb. The guys in my jc clique did not even invite me to their weddings but almost the whole class attended the wedding, even the girls and guys from other cliques.I feel as though I was never truly anyone's friend. I never felt valued or appreciated as a friend. I wish I was not born with this background or this appearance. I know I should be proud of my background but it has caused me nothing be pain and suffering. I have never been able to share my feelings and thoughts with anyone. I never felt confident of myself ever. I always feel as though I am not good enough to even be friends with these people. It is as if I have to put in so much effort just to be able to sit and eat with them. They do not need to put in any effort. They even insult me and say whatever they want. If I try to defend myself, I lose the circle and have to sit alone. So, I just had to tolerate and tolerate and tolerate and tolerate. I feel like shit. I feel like I am constantly chasing but no one actually reaching back out to me.These feelings have been affecting me alot, especially the CCA one. It has been affecting me mentally and I can see the results. My studies was affected. My career was affected. My fitness has been affected. I just feel so lonely and depressed.-#98679: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98679",27,6,0,50,0,31,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#98677,22/6/2021,"I have an abusive gf who gets disproportionally angry over the smallest things. Her temper tantrums will last upwards of over 3 days and will include a minimum 3 hour one-sided vicious rant at me. She is also in the habit of blocking my number whenever her temper tantrums kick in.We have been together for 3 years during which the abuse from her got much worse in the past 2 years. Recently in the past 2 months I have been telling her that she is really taking me for granted. The reason I say that is no matter how hurtful and spiteful her words are to me, I do not fight back and remain patient and nice to her, in the hopes that it will soften her anger. The sad thing is instead of her appreciating this, she will just double her efforts to yell at me and to hurt me further after seeing that I do not retaliate. She really drains my energy and my time.Today after she yelled at me and blocked me, I decided enough was enough and wrote an email telling her I wish to end our relationship.Is it normal to feel empty and perhaps even a sense of regret when one is leaving an abusive relationship? Logically if the relationship is toxic and I am the victim, on top of being the person who initiates the breakup, I shouldn't have regrets? Is it odd that I feel so conflicted?

I can no longer look at my work without blanking out and feeling inadequate anymore. I am probably the most unproductive staff. This is no way a researcher should be like - they can seek inputs from and work with others, but are very able to work independently. They try and fail a lot, but get back up most of the time. They are highly motivated by their curiousity, and this lets them be very perservering.I have concluded that maybe, I am just not suited for research as a lifelong career. I don't want my interest to be extinguished just like that.But these traits are also important in other areas, not just research. And without the skill sets/experience in other areas, sometimes, I wonder, would I be any different if I switched to another field?

His sex drive is pretty high( maybe about 3 times a week) and I try my best to accommodate him as long as I am able to finish my school tasks first. Sometimes when we are out on a date, he would ask for a quick one and we will just get the deed done in the toilet of a mall, it’s quite thrilling and we would be often starred at by strangers outside the handicap toilet when we are leaving.I have found out that he has a folder of obscene materials stored in his phone and it consist of leaks/video of women from school and I don’t know what to feel about it…I mean, I do understand that men have their tendencies and needs to satisfy. But I don’t really like to mentally picture my bf masturbating to other women. I have mentioned it to him casually and I have told him to record our acts together and masturbate to it  instead.

#98661,17/6/2021,"The tech industry in Singapore and Computer Science is now at the top of the food chain and the forefront of development. It can be said that CS and Tech are the king of all jobs right now. Computing students have both the money and the power, they earn a lot and are generally respected by our society. This is just a small but true story to demonstrate why the tech industry is blooming:My younger brother (born 1995) have just graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering at NUS. However, instead of going for the traditional ME role, he self-taught everything about programming and software engineering, signed up for CS modules as his UEs, and worked remotely for a mid-tier American company for 2 years. He went to class in the morning and went online for only 3 - 4 hours every night to have his works done, earning an official net monthly salary of 3600 USD - or about 4800 SGD. But the main income actually comes from the freelance and commissioned outside projects - completing 1 to 2 of these every week and he could easily earn 9k - 10k SGD in total without paying any additional dollar of tax. After working for nearly 3 years, he now owns a car and a large condominium in Orchard.Almost every girl are infatuated whenever they hear about IT guys and software engineers. There is this girl studying oversea in Australia, coming back here in Singapore to work and was referred by her older sister to work at the same bank. For some unknown reasons, when my younger brother goes to that bank and doing some transactions, he got both the girl and her elder sister at the same time, and all three started to live with each other in my younger brother's condominium. The two sisters are hailed from a relatively wealthy and prestigious family, with the father being a university professor and the mother working as a civil servant for the government. When the parents first heard about the news of all three of them living together, they are quite angry and threaten to disown the two sisters. However, after hearing that my younger brother works in the tech industry, they completely changed their attitude towards him. They called and inquired him almost every week, giving him gifts and doing everything to push him to marry their precious daughters as quickly as possible, so as not to miss on the opportunity. My younger brother should have married the elder sister this month, but due to Covid-19 restrictions and some other issues, they have been delaying their wedding ceremony.-#98661: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98661",278,321,0,0,734,126,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

After RJC one of them went to Northwestern and the other to UPenn. They both studied topics related to politics and economics, and would have gotten excellent training for careers in the public service. I thought they were both heading in that direction. They were very smart, and were “big-picture” people. i.e their interests are rather LKY-esque, or Tharman-esque. 2-3 years ago, both of them came back to Singapore and both decided to work for their “family businesses.” At least that was what they told me. But I know for a fact that for at least one of them, their family no longer owned a business because they sold their business when we were in high school. What I’m guessing they have is probably a lot of money or assets to be managed. I feel like we have a lot of these people in Singapore.

#98653,17/6/2021,"Hi, before i start, just know that this is a very long story so prepare your eyes. I’ve been reading some of the stories shared by other people here in this platform and it’s inspired me to write my own life experience here. I actually have this list that i tried to accomplish each month and one of them was to clear photos from my phone album. And this was just part of the “cleaning up” of the mess and toxic relationship that i was in, the other parts was unblocking people and just you know, not even having their names and profile appearing in my blocked list, just letting go of the memory and hurt go quietly and letting time take its course. I dont really know what i want to get out of this by sharing my story but here goes.So i met J on one of the dating app, when we first dated everything seems so smooth, he seems like a nice dude. I honestly cant rmb any good mmry we had then because its just clouded by all the bad ones. I know its too soon but i brought him to meet my family overseas also considering it was our second trip tgt. On that trip was when i found out the first cheating incident (yes you read it right, first and there were many more to come-and at this point i know some readers will be like “i stopped reading at the first cheating incident- this girl is plainly stupid”. yes youre not wrong and feel free to go, kthxbye) after i posted a photo of him on his wall with like a heart emoji. The nextmorning, one of his “friend” fb msg me and asked me how i was related to J. I told her I was his gf. She didnt know. Reader, are you still there? Brace yourselves for the next part ????So she told me, she met him, in a hotel room while she was visiting SG. This girl is Thai btw. Oh how J loves everything thai and siam dius. Lol. Anyway, my heart sunk to its deepest level when i heard that. I didnt want to believe it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt because heck this girl was not even local and not in SG, she could just be history. Plus not forgetting we were on a holiday in my hometown (im not thai) and didnt want to ruin the rest of the trip (but it was already ruined and so was the relationship, that was the start). The unwanted msg really broke me and i bawled my eyes that morning but he reassured me it was nothing, it was not real. I believed him After that trip, I wasnt the same anymore. It made me question all his words, actions and motives. Two months after that trip, i found out one of his grab booking destination was to one of the hotel in Lavender. I was, shattered. I msg the girl and asked her when she came over to SG. The grab booking matched the day when she was around. Lol and you know what was the funny part. I worked around the area where she was staying. So i confronted him again about it, he NEVER EVER admitted to the incident, so there was no apologies. But yet i stuck around :’( because you know love ? (!) and the hope that he will change to become a better man. He never did. But our toxic relationship lasted 4 years, with one break in between. After the first incident, i became more paranoid and kept asking him his whereabouts, calling him randomly and asking to on his location (i became a toxic person too tbh).At that point, i wasnt thinking anymore. I was just listening to my heart, pinning my hopes that he will change, if i just continued to be loyal to him and stay by his side no matter the shit he threw in our relationship.As i mentioned, it was the first but definitely not the last. There was so many incidents along the way that i discovered, the details are now sketchy as they have been shoved and buried to the ground (in my journey to healing). But definitely one of the most ever fucked up unimaginable, unforgivable and mind boggling acts that he did was betraying his own mother, going to all those sleazy places with his own blood father. How do i know this? I have seen and read the messages.I really cannot comprehend that part of how he can do this shenanigan to the woman who gave birth to him.. my heart breaks for aunty, so much. But i do not want to go into details with that. I just hope there is special place in hell for them for those kind of deeds.Anyway, coming to my conclusion. There was once where he told me along this line “All the guys are the same. You will still encounter the same type” I just want to tell him that NO i still do not believe in that, and just because you do and act in a certain way, you classify and conclude all men to be like that, just to make it seem normal and acceptable, hell fucking no, what you did and what you have done, will never ever be acceptable even if im the last person standing by this idea, i will vouch for it till the very end. You know why? I met this guy who is very sweet and gentle and he is there for me whenever i need him and he has shown me what a real gentleman should be like. So im really thankful and blessed you broke me into pieces that day for me to finally pack up and walk out that door and that relationship that very morning.

#98652,17/6/2021,"Here's a little story that I really need to get off my chest and hopefully get advice on...A little background on myself is I used to be the bubbly and happy-go-lucky figure among my friends and colleagues. I loved to keep myself occupied with motivational podcasts on a daily basis and be seen as motivated and energetic all the time. I am an extrovert (or was).These days, I'm just laying at home (unemployed), mentally torn, and struggling to make sense of what is to come.Well, the thing is, I have been emotionally scarred due to verbal abuse from my parents back during my primary and secondary school days. I often received criticisms, discouragement and got mocked by them when I share about my daily activities/achievements. Naturally, I turned to bottling things up from JC onwards which eventually took a toll on my mental and emotional health. And in fact, I barely remember my family having any constructive discussion on well-being or anything (be in about education, relationship, or finances)It doesn’t help that I was physically abused by my elder sibling since young which soured our relationship as we grew older.To make matters worse, I was admitted to IMH a few years ago and was diagnosed with a mental illness. Been in and out of hospital since then. This hasn’t been a surprise to me but I would have loved to avoid it. People around me assumed it was due to stress from uni which resulted in the episodes. Yet deep inside, I felt that it was a problem that had compounded since childhood and only exploded when it was too much to contain.I have my friends. But at the same time, I seldom reveal my emotional despair to others. I do not open up to people easily partly due to the strained experiences since childhood.  It has also affected my relationship with my previous partners as I couldn’t get comfortable with being vulnerable to them.At this point, everything is still taking a toll on my mental and emotional health. The current covid environment isn't helping because it feels so cold and lonely in my family with little interaction.I don’t really know what advice to seek but I think it would be beneficial to know how I can overcome the emotional scarring and how I can lead my life moving forward?-#98652: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98652",12,1,0,15,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would never expect someone who looked decent on the outside to do a thing like this, and I was quite surprised by my close friend's behaviour. Granted, it was only less than a year since he broke up with his girlfriend, and he have been constantly texting me and complained how lonely and bored he was, and he have been going on to various dating apps to try to make new friends and expand his social circle. But to humiliate random girls' figure, shaming them about how fat they are just disgusts me, like eh, you also don't look that good like a celebrity, what makes you think that you have the right to shame them? He would also share about how pretty some of his colleagues are and seeing their faces makes his day at work better.I wanted to block him but I guess I was too soft-hearted to do so.

After checking, I knew immediately I wasn't the one who spoilt it. I told her that the light was spoilt because someone tried to spin it with force and didn't loosen the knob. But she would hear nothing of it. She just keep insisting that I was the one who spoilt it (Note: the light was fine after I used it until 7pm the night before!!). After a heated debate, she finally said that ""I just want to tilt the light back to the straight position and it broke"". Kanina so you broke it lah. Then why kp me early in the morning? Why must say I broke it cos I'm the one who keeps using it? Why am I always the target for her mental abuse and manipulation?Anyway my point is, I really hate how my mum ALWAYS tries to push the blame to me when shit happens.

#98623,17/6/2021,"Possibly Aromantic/Asexual guy here.For the past 20+ years of my life, I never felt any connection or desire towards anybody , except to this girl that I got to know and had a nice connection with for quite some time.We are quite intimate and I was there for her throughout her ex-toxic relationship. I thought for sure that we had something going on. She was still pretty close to me even when she got out of her toxic relationship but she entered into another one before I had a chance to confess to her. I confessed to her anyway but got rejected because she said she wanted to try out her current relationship , but we remained friends.Her relationship was pretty shaky because she was the one who chased after the guy and from what I and our group of friends can tell, the guy was probably just stringing her along. Initially I was quite reluctant , but I was supportive and encouraged her to keep on trying even when they had fights and almost broke up.Fast forward a few months, I can see that it was clear that the guy is just playing with her and taking her for granted. I tried to intervene and made it clear that I dislike her current guy for basically taking her for granted and not giving her back as much as she gave him in that relationship. From this point onwards, everything went downhill and she gives me the cold shoulder, making it clear that if I cannot accept the boyfriend, she would not even be friends with me.The thing is, even till now, it is still pretty obvious that the guy is stringing her along with no concrete plans to be with her in the future , and she choose to live on in this dream of her, instead of actually talking it out with him to stop wasting time. I would be happy for her if her relationship happens to take a good turn and she ends up happily ever after, but with things going this way, I doubt the guy would stay with her for long.I would not mind waiting for her to be single again and try to chase after her, but in the mean time, what would be a good way to mend our relationship when I cannot stand the sight of her ""player"" boyfriend. Also, as mentioned, I am possibly asexual/aromantic , so I am not going to look  for another relationship to get over her anytime soon. I also have plenty of hobbies and a decent job , so I am actually fine/happy being single , had been doing that for the past over 2 decades.It just feels so wrong to see her trying so hard and sacrificing so much of her time and money to keep that guy around, and he barely does anything in return and possibly just pocketing her.-#98623: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98623",24,2,0,3,8,10,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

My heart skipped a beat. Was he cheating on me? Was he texting other girls?. He seemed very nervous and told me I should have knocked on the door. In any case I sat and we kissed and chat a little. He said he needed to go and get something to drink and led me to the living room. He asked me to wait there while he went to Starbucks.My mind was still curious. So I went to his bedroom and searched under the pillow and to my shock it was Kinohimitsu Bust Up Drink! And it was empty! ""Gosh! Dont tell me he is drinking that!"" I thought.

I have almost suffered from depression when I was studying in A levels just because she kept deducing me for not studying whenever I went home from dorm every weekends when i locked myself in my piano room to practise piano just because I was not only doing my A levels but also my LTCL exam, but I felt very bad just because she kept scolding and blaming me in this way just like I'm really lazy and not doing hard enough when she never noticed how hard i had been studying at school, after school every weekends, though i know she's just having lack of security...just because of her harsh views and opinions, everyone in my family have been compromising her for more than 10 to 20 years just because she can never give in no matter in life, in our education choice, in our life choices and a lot more... I do understand she's trying to be a good mother from the way she wants just because she lost her mother when she was born and she was trying to give us everything and anything she didn't able to get since young. I know she loves all her kids very much. I have to admit I can endure more insults, judges and bad words from others more than my peers. I do understand that she's just saying out however by repeating this everyday including what i buy and eat everyday just like parrot really makes me stressful...I told her many times can you please don't repeat everyday and I have remembered and i don't buy those food anymore just because you think it's not good to eat too frequent just because I really feel like her way of talking really makes me feel like blaming me for buying this and that and not taking care of myself well and i know she's just trying to express her care to me... but I really feel stressful whenever i try to talk to her well until I don't even know how to communicate correctly with her anymore. [Reason: I'm in Singapore while my parents are in Malaysia and I do share what i do and eat to them everyday so they know how I'm doing when they can't see me] However, what I care is also about my mental health. Sometimes, when i talk to her and whenever she sounds like educating me again ( though i know she is trying to give me care) those memories including how much i have endured and how i hurted myself in the past maybe now as well would make me more emotional and she will keep saying that I'm now against them...though I'm not...I feel like being kidnapped morally when she always tries to use how other kids won't do to their parents which makes me guilty until it will make me losing control by hurting myself (biting myself, crying for one whole day even weeks, and so on) when I am full of bad emotions. This really affects me a lot in making friends as well as how my friends treat me may also lead me to face such extreme emotion as well. I don't even feel like exposing to others as telling out is rather useless...it's like...i feel no one is standing on my side when I'm educated to compromise though i do understand expecting understanding is never possible. Besides, my mum will also blame me for being silly enough just because i hurted myself in the past...it's like depression doesn't exist in this world and it's impossible for mr to have depression which, in fact, nearly engulfed me. I can never forget those days when i hid in my room and cried and hurted myself in the past, and maybe occasionally for now. Everyone in my family including my aunts(my mum's sisters) my cousins(who grew up with her) and a lot more have been asking me to compromise her...just compromise her. This is how i have been educated to give in since young just to stop quarrelling at home and by just to be a giving person. However, I really cannot take it anymore...I do understand she's my mother who take cares me a lot...and i do understand as a kid, i should treat her well and follow her will. However, her illogical way of thinking and mindsets on judging me really makes me feel inferior as I don't even know how much effort should I do in order to get her satisfy... I do accept her point of view that competition will trigger us to work harder and stay stronger in work field, however, I don't think my mental is healthy. It's like ... I don't even know what can I do anymore... so what should I do? What can I do to communicate properly with her?-#98613: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98613",27,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

We went out a few times before, and I was the one who initiated all the text messages and ask him if he wants to go out. Because I was the one always initiating, I am not sure if it means he is uninterested in me. Whenever I text first, he replies and asks me questions back but we do not engage in long conversations. During the first few times we met, he was quite shy and did not engage in much eye contact; but he slowly opened up during subsequent meetups and seemed more comfortable and chatty. He has mentioned before that he is quite shy and busy, but I am not sure if he is actually uninterested in me, or it is his personality/ he is too busy which causes him not to text/ meet me more often. I give him space and do not text him unnecessarily during workdays as he may be busy, and I am not pushy.Should I continue to invest my time and effort into Guy B and hope that he reciprocates my effort, or should I spend more time with Guy A to see if I would develop an interest in him?-#98606: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98606",29,3,0,0,0,25,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

#98594,17/6/2021,"I'm starting to have second doubts about this marriage. I have shared this with my friends but just wanna gather more perspectives here.My in laws are draining the hell out of me. I always felt as if i was walking on eggshells around them and I rly dread seeing them. My fiance's mother is very controlling regarding the way i dress and she doesn't like me wearing sleeveless clothings or denim shorts. To make things clear, my dressing is not provocative in any way and i dress quite similar to most girls you see in Singapore. There was once when i went over to their place after a gym sesh so i was in a tank top and shorts. To my horror, during dinner she casually commented on how my parents didn't raise me well because women are supposed to be traditional and conservative. I was rly furious that she spoke badly about my parents and wanted to retaliate but my fiance nudged me and told me to just let it go. Some boomers love to use traditionalism as a way to shove their opinions down people's throat, don't they?My in laws also have oppressive personalities. The father used to be a sign on army officer and I can tell that he had trained his children well to not talk back by citing filial piety, even when things seemed unreasonable. My friend told me that this is a sign of dictatorship within the family culture and i will have a hard time after marriage because my husband will not be able to defend me at all if there's any family conflicts. Dining out with them is the worst and sometimes they would arrange for dinner together only on the day itself. Due to the nature of my job, I have to meet clients and sometimes because of delays I would end up being late for the dinner. I find it rly hard to accept their double standards. For eg if dinner was set to be at 7pm and they arrive at 6.45pm and I get there at 6.55pm, I would be deemed late. If I cannot make it due to prior appointments with clients or friends/colleagues, I would have to put up with their cold attitude the next time I see them.I'm sure that I'm not the only one who finds their behavior toxic.

#98584,17/6/2021,"To those who felt that you are at the stage if talking about settling down instead of breaking up with your boyfriend or girlfriend who doesn't seem to be the right one, trust me, it's never too late. It's better to break it off now instead of marrying the wrong one. I am a 过来人. I was 28 (F) when I broke off with my then bf of 3 years. We already talked about marriage, applied for BTO, planned for our future wedding dates, etc. Everyone thought that we will definitely get married one day. But others don't see what's really happening between us. He is a smart guy, with high paying job and constantly given praises by people around him. Basically he is like the Mr Perfect in everyone's eye. He was the one who chased me. When we first got together, we felt like we complement each other. Eventually, it started to become me chasing after his perfection. Like because he is this perfect, I need go be as perfect. And no, he didn't tell me it is ok to be who I am cause that's who he really loves, he expects me to be as perfect as him. He finds me watching drama, reading blogs all these as wasting my time away (PS: I only do it once I'm done with my work). He always talk on the phone about work and when I commented that I didnt get enough attention from him, he said at least he is doing something that earns money and not laze around. But I was in love. Afterall, he is the Mr Perfect and everyone tells me how I should not lose him. Then it started to take a toll on my mental health, crying to sleep everynight cause I felt like I was never good enough. I communicated the issues with him and he didn't feel like he has any wrong. Eventually, we decided to go on our separate ways, and gave up on our BTO. The rs was so painful that it took me 2 years to decide that I need to start opening my heart again. Went on some dates (dating app) and went on a few dates with those I thought we have chemistry when talking via app but ZERO chemistry when we met irl. At 33 years old, I met a guy via mutual friend. We hit off instantly. I really enjoyed talking to him. He is not perfect.. not well educated, earn less than me, slightly shorter than me, few years younger than me. To put it bluntly, people would say he ""pick until gold"" if I ever agree to be his gf. I shared with my friends that I was interested in him and none of my friends felt that we can work out cause he is too different from my previous Mr Perfect style. But I went ahead to agree to be his gf within one month after knowing him. And fast forward, I am 37 year old now. He proposed to me after we were together for only 3 months cause he felt like I am the one for him, just as how I also told him I felt like he is the one for me. We got married 10 months after getting together. We are going to celebrate our 3 years wedding anniversary soon and our first son came out just last year. Couples can be together for 10 years and still breakup while couples who are tgt for 10 days could meant for ever. Length of rs does not determine how successful the rs will be. It could be 10 years old quarrel or 10 months of working towards being one. So it is never too late to break up with the wrong one. I thought I was gonna be single for life but my soul mate appeared when I was no longer looking. It may be late but it's better than suffering all my life being with the wrong one. Don't ever decide your life based on society norms. Do what you think is best for you and your mental health. Ask yourself what makes you happy and do all the happy things when you are single. Share those happy moments when you meet your future soul mate down the road and eventually share more happy moments when you find the one.

As a young NUS student, having had no relationship experience, I longed for the thrill of an exciting relationship, for a guy who would sweep me off my feet. My first boyfriend fit the description almost too well. He'd buy me chocolates when I'm on my period, flowers on my birthdays. He'd take me out on fancy dates, spending way more than I know he can afford; and he'd repeat to me how much he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. This carried on for months. But his infatuation with me soon faded, and he had been flirting with another girl for 3 months before I finally broke it off with him.I've had a total of 3 relationships, all of which ended in the same tragic way.Now that I'm almost 30, I realized that all I really want now is security. To have someone I can go home to every day, with whom I don't have to worry about how I dress, or how I speak, or how I behave. Someone who will always take my side. Someone who just listens to me without trying to change me. Someone who wouldn't get bored or sick of me even as I slowly age into an old woman. I want someone who is just there for me, all the time, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want someone who's willing to commit to be the lifelong partner for me as my dad has been to my mom.

#98571,17/6/2021,"My bf of over a year (1 year and 3 months to be exact) had broken my trust due to him apologizing without changing his behavior almost a year into our rs when I opened up to him about how I felt neglected and not listened to. (Our 'conversations' consisted of practically just hellos and goodbyes, even during weekends. There were also a few instances where he just ignored me when I really wanted his reassurance, something that I have brought up before, although I understand he was busy with uni stuff, but when I asked him when it could be talked about, I just got ignored.)Long story short: I felt really neglected. Felt like he didn't care about me. Communicated my needs to him several times. He apologized and promised to change his behavior, nothing changed. I gave him lots of chances. Nothing changed. Trust in him is shattered. It hurt me a lot. I really wanted out. I told him that and gave him an ultimatum. He apologized for taking me for granted and told me he would make time for me etc., he begged me to give him one last chance. I gave him that chance. I'd say he's doing a little better, but part of me is scarred from the whole thing of giving him the chances in the past. It seems like worries, doubts and resentment had built up and I keep thinking why he didn't treat me better earlier on, why it had to result to me giving him an ultimatum before treating me better. To this day, I still keep on thinking what I am to him, even though he's treating me better, I don't think my trust in him has returned. I'm not sure if it can be restored to the way it was. It's like the ghost of the past, rather, the memories of the past keeps haunting me. How he treated me in the past replays in my mind, and whenever I remember it, I just cry. It really hurt a lot. People always equate trust to that of a shattered mirror, where regardless of how much you try to pierce it together, the cracks will always show. He said he's determined he will earn it back, and that he really wants and loves me, he's showing it in his actions, but I'm honestly scared that I'd get hurt like that again. It seems like I've been scarred. I'm not sure if I trust him. Yes, I love him a lot, but .. I'm not sure if I trust him, if he could earn back my trust, if our rs would to back to the way it was before he had broken my trust, if there will come a time when the doubts in my mind would clear up, when I would feel secure with him..Is it possible for someone to earn one's trust back when it's been thoroughly broken several times? Would there come a time when the doubts, the worries, the fog in my mind would clear up regarding why he took me for granted in the first place etc.?

Before you go on to say that he doesn’t trust me because of something I did, no I didn’t cheat or do anything even close to cheating. Throughout the past 2 years, I have been 100% loyal to him. No odd messages or unnecessary one on one meet ups with the opp gender. He knows every single one of my friends (I usually keep to a small circle of friends) and I tell him everything. I meet him almost everyday and we video call (instead of voice call) so there is literally no secrets between us.Before him, I’ve had exes and serious dates and so I’m more sexually experienced than him even though he’s older than me. Is it reasonable for him to feel that I have the tendency to sleep around just because of that? I don’t. So now every time I go out to drink with my friends (which is prolly like once in 3 months), he gets all upset. I had drinks with my colleagues the other day and ended up vomiting because of excessive yakult. Yes, my yakult soju’s ratio was prolly 3 yakult to 1 soju. So I texted him “I vomited :(“He didn’t respond and only said “rest well b” the next morning. Turns out he got mad at me because of that vomiting saga and was having second thoughts about our bto plans. Wtff.

#98555,17/6/2021,"I am the OP of #98475I see alot of pp bashing me because i don't give mthly allowance and my mom waived off my tuition fee from her cpf. For context that i didn't see a need to elaborate (since it was just to explain to the original requestor the starting pt i was on), i wanted to pay off the lump sum tuition fee to my mom's CPF (i accumulated enough within a year) and for the first year i was providing allowance on a mthly basis (market rate). My mom however, feels that waiving off the amt in CPF and getting it in cash instead was better for her since she preferred cash and it would remove interest for me ( win win). In addition, she herself preferred the option that i saved the money and grow it such that i can pay for their subsequent hospital bills/home needs instead of a lump sum payment to them to spend as they wish.My parents refused when i wanted to get them insurance because they were adamant that its a ""scam"" despite me talking to them multiple times and getting agents to try and convince them. Also they have health issues which does not have insurance providing adequate coverage in their current age, as advised by the agents. Oh and why we have a bad relationship? Because my parents were physically abusive and i was hospitalised multiple times, yes, even when schooling. And yeaps, no allowances from them, i'm expected to earn it myself. In addition, the allowance i provided monthly was spent off gambling within a week ( yeaps the whole sum). Hence, after discussion with my mom, its best that i pay direct for what they need as and when they need it.So yes, get off your high horses and stop being salty. To those saying i have a headstart, woah, Nope i didn't. I worked throughout uni to support myself and minimise burden on my parents.So yea, less judgemental nonsense and more hustling instead. Maybe instead of trying to be keyboard warriors with an over inflated, over imaginative, salty mindset... it would be good to realise not everyone feels the need to go into details about their family dynamics. Since so many want to make assumptions, then i will clarify it and i hope, in your daily life, instead of choosing to bash others without the full story, do things more constructive instead and of course,More understanding, less judgey.

#98553,17/6/2021,"Is it normal to not be ready to enter a relationship? I'm already 30 years old this year. I admit that I have this deep suspicion that I'm gay. Whenever I see guys outside with good physiques and looks, my gaze would linger on just a bit longer to admire them. I sometimes do fantasize having a relationship with a guy, but that's about it. I simply can't imagine myself being in a relationship with anyone. At first I thought that it was my parents that I'm worried about. They are conventional, and would definitely not take it that easily when they find out that their son is sexually unconventional. This was what I thought impeded me from entering a relationship. Because I would rather die alone and single than to fake a relationship with a lady. It's just unfair for both of us, more for the lady. Yet gradually, I realised that I might be the reason why I'm not getting into a relationship. Sometimes I think that interacting with others can be tiring, but other times I find myself longing for companionship. It's this see saw type of feeling that makes me all the more confused. So am I this, or that? Do I want to commit to a relationship, or do I just yearn for one just for the sake of it? Here's what I did to test out myself. I sieved through my past experiences with my friends. What I found out was that most of the time, I'm reluctant to make the first conversation, take the first move, or propose something first. Also, I would become very uptight when I'm with someone, even with people I know well. It's like there is a control in me that is holding me captive, and I can only be my actual self in my own room at home. Even in front of my family, I would put on a semi facade, and only remove it once I'm in my own safe space. Yes, it gets tiring, but somehow I got used to it. It's similar to taking off your mask when returning home from work. You finally get to breathe some air.

#98546,17/6/2021,"To OP #98426: I guess I could share some advise/ experience as someone who has been in my family's company for a few yearsFor some context, I actually did not want to work in my family's business. But due to me not getting any offers, I felt I did not have a choice (my starting pay was average for a fresh graduate at the time). There will certainly be those that judge you for ""taking the easy way out"". But, at the end of the day, what matters is that you make the best choice for yourself. I count myself lucky that my closest friends understand and accept the decision I have made (they also do know some of the issues I have faced in my workplace, which leads them to be more understanding). I know it's hard. There are people who accuse me of flaunting privilege sometimes when I just talk about family. One of my largest reservations back when I was 25 was how I would be perceived for working in my family's company (I actually cried when I realised that I was going to be working in my family's company).Working in one's family company certainly has its perks. As you have alluded to, you would be exposed to management, a valuable skill whether you choose to stay on in your family's company or leave in the future (This is coming from someone who has contemplated leaving my family's company on several occasions, so never say never). You also get more exposed to different aspects of business, again something a regular employee would not get. On the other hand, the politics can really be a pain. Company politics has a completely different dynamic once family becomes involved. It's one the biggest reasons I have contemplated leaving my family's company.There can also be awkwardness between you and colleagues due to them knowing you are the boss's kid. I guess the simple advise I can give would be to treat everyone nicely and not ""flaunt privilege"". It was awkward between me and some colleagues initially; but things have improved significantly, with some sharing information with me that they would not share with the bosses.All in all, I do not regret joining my family's company. As mentioned earlier, there are those who would judge me. However, their opinions don't matter to me as I had made the best decision for me. As someone who does not understand the way your family/ family company works, it would not be appropriate for me to try and convince you which direction is better for you. All I would advise is tune out the noise and the judgement from those who don't matter and make the best decision for yourself. Hope this helps you. Wishing you all the best in whichever path you choose!-#98546: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98546",3,2,0,0,0,11,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

#98544,17/6/2021,"Ok i just need an avenue to speak and express some stuff. So far NUSWhispers has been a great place to do so. Some background, when i was younger my mom used to cane me a lot. Theres never a month that went by where i wouldnt get canned because i was either rude to my father or cause i did smt stupid in public. Its usually the former because my rs with dad was terrible, mostly due to my parents’ bad rs. I still preferred my mother more because i knew she was the breadwinner of my family. I know she felt bad for hitting me but she doesnt know how else to parent me. Once shes cooled down she usually buys me things like food i like. (This ended up with me now having very bad relationship with money, and fear of commitment to woman. I cant love properly) besides the point tho. So when i was 5/6, because of the cannings, i thought if my mom could do that to me, i could do that to anyone who irritated me right? No one told me i couldnt. So one day my helper didnt relent to one of my request for a small thing i wanted and i went to find my mom’s cane. I tried to hit her. I dont remember her being afraid of me and i just knew i was genuinely having fun because i thought my mom was having fun when she hit me. So i told my helper to go hide under the kitchen sink. I wanted to play hide and seek, while i was holding the cane. Idk why she didnt stop me because she was more than twice my size. I was a fat kid though but still. Its so screwed up that i, a kid forced a grown woman who is tryna make a living in a foreign country, under a sink, and threatened her with a cane because i learnt it from my mom. My helper didnt say anything to my parents. Next morning all her belongings were gone. She left the house in the middle of the night, went to the police, and my parents were apparently facing charges in court. On hindsight thank god she did what she did. She didnt hit me, and she left right away to the police. Had she said anything to my parents maybe they would have made her stay. Dont attack my parents cause they’re nice normal people just that they hit their kids to parent them. This was 18 almost 20 years ago.

#98538,17/6/2021,"Can I ask why some of you have such a big problem with inherited wealth?Are you against people owning more than 1 property (commercial or residential)? Or are you against people being given the right to gift their properties to whomever they please? What about cash? Are we against people being able to accumulate large sums of cash? Or are we against people being able to gift their accumulated cash to whomever they please?If we think about the typical employment arrangement. Your employer hires you (and pays you), because you provide some benefit to his objectives. Some people do not provide any benefit to their employer at all and yet they continue to be paid. Some jobs at companies can be eliminated entirely without much impact to the company's P&L, and yet they continue to exist. For whatever reason, society has deemed it acceptable (legal) for employers to keep non-performing workers employed. If we think about the typical sales and purchase arrangement. You agree to buy something, a good or a service, with varying degrees of knowledge of what benefit it'll actually give you. Sometimes you pay for a service or a product that you never use in your lifetime. Sometimes you buy a packet of cai fan and it goes bad on your kitchen counter. Sometimes you buy a packet of cai fan for 50% more money from one store when you could've gotten it cheaper if you had gone round the back at a hawker center. This willing-buyer willing-seller arrangement has been deemed acceptable, because by-and-large, society has deemed it necessary for people to be able to spend money as they please.When we talk about inheritance, it is a similar arrangement. You decide to bequeath your wealth to your children (or anyone other than your children), because they have provided some benefit (tangible or intangible) to you throughout your lifetime. For example, I have been an object of love to my parents. So, by the same logic that you buy a screen protector for your phone, my parents have justified their own actions in whatever way they have when they decide to bequeath their wealth to me.So my question is, why are people not against the right to get protection for their iPhones but are somehow against parents giving their children financial protection?-#98538: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98538",21,3,0,0,7,15,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

#98535,17/6/2021,"I always admired people to whom science and math come naturally to them. I really love the physical sciences, but I've always been mediocre at them. I can watch documentaries about physics for hours and hours, or proof-writing lectures for hours and hours. I understand them perfectly when they are presented and explained to me, but whenever I am expected to do problems, to write proofs, I choke. I'm from a very wealthy family and I have had all the resources to be a great STEM student. I never succeeded. Oddly enough, I was always really good at the humanities. I was a HP student at both HCI and HCJC. I have a degree in Ethics, Politics, and Economics from Yale, and I'm currently doing a dual JD/MPA degree at Columbia. Law and public administration was never really my calling, but since I've always been good at these topics without much effort at all, I stuck to them just out of pragmatism. I've always put my mediocrity in STEM down to pure laziness. I am really lazy to a fault, which is probably a symptom of my having being born with a lot of privilege. For some reason, when it comes to history, or social studies, or politics, or economics, everything just comes naturally to me without much of any studying at all. It almost seems like I have an eidetic memory for readings in the social sciences, but I can't seem to replicate the same ability/aptitude that I have for the social sciences with STEM disciplines. As I grew older, I started to realize that my lack in aptitude in STEM cannot just be a manifestation of my lack in effort, but it must be because of my lack in intelligence. Even though I will be graduating soon, qualified as a lawyer and a public policymaker, I can't get over the fact that I could not for the life of me figure out how to do well in theoretical physics, in pure math, and in advanced computer science (even though I'm great at econometrics and data science).

My parents have seen my bruises and are a little concerned. I cannot keep wearing long sleeves to hide the bruises. We also recently applied received a good queue number for our BTO.

After our recent quarrels, i don't know if i can see him in my future... right now i'm just compromising and bottling up because i dont wanna tell my bestfriends about this and ruin their impression of him. I have no one to speak to and this is killing me inside. What do i do? I feel so lost. Is it time to give up/let go? I'm already 28... isit too late to find new relationships?

#98530,17/6/2021,"Thoughts on professionals/ employees crying at work?I was recently visiting my elderly aunt who was hospitalised at one of our major public hospitals. We were chatting happily when all of a sudden there was a huge commotion at the opposite bed when one of the patients suddenly collapsed and became unconscious. The next thing I knew, a whole team of almost 10 people rushed in to attend to the patient with the alarms blaring throughout the hospital PA system about a ""Code Blue"" (which I later learned is called when patients collapse and need CPR).Fast forward about 1 hour later, the group of 8 (yes, I counted) slowly left the patient's side one by one. The poor husband only came towards the end of the hour and so did not even know what had happened. One of the junior doctors (very young, looks like just graduated) then stepped outside of the curtains to speak to him and to my shock, she only managed a few words then choked up and couldn't even deliver the news properly and proceeded to excuse herself (probably to cry) just like that... Everyone else was just stepping aside to pack up and left the husband there standing in confusion and shock. It took almost 10 minutes later until another more senior doctor, I think one of the professors, had to come in to help explain everything to the husband instead. His heartbreak I cannot even fathom.I don't doubt that working in the hospital is difficult. There are surely a lot of deaths out there. But I don't think it is right for medical PROFESSIONALS to put their own grief of losing their patient (whom they only see for a few hours at work everyday) above the families' (who are literal life and blood and whom they have known and loved from birth). How can you even think your loss is greater than the family's?  It puts the families in very uncomfortable situations in needing to ""comfort"" the crying doctor/ nurse instead, or in very confusing situations like the above, which is ridiculous. I suggest the hospitals should look into protocols to enforce that the more senior doctors  should be the ones updating families, and for more training of professionalism in this aspect. Grieving is natural and a part of life, but there is always a time and place for it, and I don't think any workplace (much less hospitals) should be it.-#98530: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98530",136,48,194,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

#98523,17/6/2021,"Just a bit of a rant from someone new in NUS middle management.It's really frustrating because people are often coming and going. Really makes you think about the people with decades-long service awards, because they're either absolute troopers or people who know how to play the workplace politics game way too well. It's also really frustrating dealing with upper management, because they kind of just do what they want and you get dragged along for the ride. See, you don't really have a voice as a middle management person. You just do whatever ""upstairs"" tells you to do. I think it's kind of jarring that as staff we get also emails from UHC #AreYouOkay but then there's no actual avenue for anonymized feedback regarding various policies, projects and whatever else. We're not heard! We just go about from day to day doing whatever upstairs tells us to do even when it's frustrating or tedious or honestly tone-deaf. And whenever there's something that upper management wants to do, it will inevitably trickle down to middle management.Then there's students. Don't get me wrong, NUS students are generally really nice. I've received lots of really polite emails requesting for help. A few strange emails from less-than-nice personalities are normal, most of us take it as outliers. But NUS students can be quite intense, which in return puts pressure on us to do things, even more so when the pressure reaches ""upstairs"". The students are here to study, to achieve, to get the whole uni package completed before they graduate, and we totally get that and want to help them along. We want to offer more mods to allow people to fulfill their grad requirement too, but sometimes there's just a manpower crunch what with exoduses of academic staff and all... and in the end, what can we do but to respond to everyone apologizing for the lack of mods, and then try to ramp up hiring for acad staff. I personally don't want to throw a spanner in the works for the students, and honestly it's not the fault of the students to, because you all are here to do what you have to do. It's just the pressure that comes from it all, unfortunately, and I feel like in the role of middle management, you feel the brunt of it more than anyone else.Beyond the acad staff crunch, there's also an admin staff crunch. Like I said, people are always coming and going. And not everyone leaves behind a guide for their successor. I've had to learn so much on my own. It's been tough, but the pressure keeps mounting every day. And I slowly realise why everyone is always coming and going. Sometimes I think I want to leave too, but it's also not like I have a lot of options in the current state of our economy.Will NUS ever bring #AreYouOkay in to some form of reality, for both staff and students alike, or will it always be just a hashtag and a way of halfhearted wayang about how much they care?-#98523: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98523",4,0,0,0,0,11,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#98521,17/6/2021,"I would need advice as I'm feeling pretty lost from my previous relationship experiences... I met my first ex a few years back and I have to say, he's a rather nice guy but his heart is unsettled for a committed relationship. He gets bored easily and less initiative once we got together. We broke up because he said that we will get into fights frequently, but in my perspective, which couple don't fight? Communication is key to compromise flaws and to work things out. Despite more sadness and heartbreaks, I felt much happier and truly in love because the fortunate thing was the person you like, likes you back too. Then, I met my second ex-boyfriend. Everyday, i thank God for blessing me a nearly perfect husband material. I was loved, and I loved him. We worked every single things out whenever there's obstacles. We were in sync. However, I don't feel as happy as I was. I had to be truthful to myself, probably he loved me more than I love him, while I loved my first ex more than he loves me. Because I didn't want to be unfair towards him, I initiated to break. I felt he deserves someone better sincerely. So here's the dilemma, to be with someone you love, or with someone who loves you more? I know relationship is more than just feelings, but also the willingness to work as one together in bills, babies, lifestyle etc. No doubt, first ex gives me so much lovely feelings even if should there be any issues or etc, I will gladly help in a heartbeat without hestitation. While the second ex, I know my life will be well taken care of, but I don't seem to be emotionally attracted to him and always had to find ways to make myself happy. I feel happy naturally with my first ex while I force myself to feel happy with my second ex.

Apart from the social stigma of having kids for the sake of having because everyone else in your circle is doing the same. I have discussed with my gf and she doesnt seem to be interested in having kids next time due to the reason of pain and how we might not be able to cope with kid(s) and work as the responsibility is really important. Personally i still don’t know if i want kids, but the main few reasons for wanting might be because i was raised in a family oriented household hence the influence so my parents would definitely be happy to have grandchildren (i know it shouldnt be the main reason), and also like they can accompany us and take care of us when we are old, and like a “feeling” of a complete family as it’s like the next stage of life to look forward to. My colleagues around me just became dads and from the way they talk about how they only sleep about 3-4 hours per night for the first year or so gets me really sian although it’s part and parcel.

#98512,17/6/2021,"Didn't really want to post here but I'd just like to have some opinions, so here goes my story:  I'm currently in a relationship for about 1.5 years, me and my S/O do not really interact a lot on a day to day basis as we both have our work commitments, though we do meet up once or twice a week on a weekly basis. Here's the catch, whenever we meet, my S/O would just eat (be it me cooking or us tabao'ing food over) , sleep after that (literally, not cuddle) and I'll send her home for the day. Make no mistakes, I'm not saying that this is bad but our little interaction with each other has caused me to somewhat feel like the relationship is more of an obligation than an actual relationship, whereby when we do actually go out, little things like carrying my S/O's bag for him/her makes me feel like I'm being used.(Yes, I know, I'm not actually being used). The next twist in the story would be me having met another person. My interaction with this person was naturally more than my S/O because of what I mentioned above, and I came to realize that this person has really good habits (does chores filial), morals and upbringing (to the point where upon knowing that I'm attached, chose to distance ourselves despite me telling the person that I only treat him/her as a friend).  To add on, our interaction with each other made me feel a sense of happiness that I haven't felt in a long time, similar to how you feel when you laugh together with a crush.  Currently, I have two dilemma, the first would be what should I do with my current relationship. The second would be if what I feel about the new person is pure infatuation (or not) and whether I should try seeking something more from this person.

#98509,17/6/2021,"I want to understand why working for family businesses would be construed in our society as something to be embarrassed about. Are we that balls-deep in this idea of meritocracy that we don't realize that on some level, there is nothing truly meritocratic? This whole obsession with being ""self-made"" is driving a lot of people to make sub-optimal decision just because they want to demonstrate that they got to where they are with minimal involvement of nepotism. So let me ask you a simple question, would Lee Hsien Loong have been Prime Minister had his father been a 9-5 salesperson at Best Denki and not Lee Kuan Yew? Just mull that over for a bit. Everyone starts their lives at different levels of privilege. Whether you like it or not, very few success stories start at absolute zero. The question now is, how much do you want each newborn in society to start at equal footing? Even if you could make equal the amount of resources a child receives throughout his/her lifetime, genetics would still play an unimaginable role. My younger sister has a near-eidetic memory, for example, and she is a PSC scholar. I, on the other hand, barely graduated NUS and I'm working as a real estate agent while she may become a cabinet minister someday. Nobody got to where they are without nepotism. The fact that parents decide to care for their own children and not someone else's children is already a form of nepotism. The fact that some of us left to be independent after uni does not nullify our parents' contribution to our lives. The idea that someone else's parents continue to make contributions to their lives and yours don't does not nullify the fact that your parents would have also contributed more to your life than the parents of some other schmuck out there who is more successful than you are right now. The line drawn between when parental contribution is considered obligatory and when it is considered nepotism is as arbitrary as the idea that anyone can claim to be self-made. Nobody is self-made.I think we as a society should stop feeling jealous that some people are born to rich parents. We cannot solve this inequality without consciously encroaching on the freedom of anyone to do what they please with their wealth so we should stop making people feel bad for receiving wealth. We have all received wealth whether it's in the form of transfers from the government (which is other people's money first and foremost), or in the form of parental contribution. You are not ""better"" if you receive less of it. Lastly, don't even pretend that if your parents had $50 million in Orchard real estate you would turn it down if it were offered to you.

This time he drove law by law, so I was totally OK with it now. Its just that I noticed he yawned a few times while driving, so after arriving at the restaurant I decided it was my turn to ask if he was okay and use the opportunity to dig more bout his driving habits and history.He was forthcoming with me and confessed in me laughingly that he crashed twice in his first 2 years of his 7years of driving, and both times was in slow start stop jam type of traffic where he dozed off at the wheel because he was tired after work. He also explain that actually he is aiming for maximum fuel mileage. then he went into a needy technical rant how about speed/RPM is directly proportionate to the mileage so he is trying to go as fast as possible with as low an RPM as possible and avoid braking. (how true is this? Comments? for cerato 2020 model is 13.5km/l good?) Once he mentioned it I did some recalling of that first drive, he really didnt accelerate quickly and didnt brake much, he reached the 140-160km/h mark gradually and its then when, to maintain that speed, he rather keep changing lanes than brake and before entering the spiral, I don't even think he braked, he just gradually slowed down and entered at 70-80km/h and maintained it thru.The ride back was safe and lawful as well but again I caught him yawning a few times. During the ride he also told me that after our discussion the last time he was driving law by law now even without me. But now I'm like errrmmm would I rather he drive slow and risk falling asleep and crash or drive faster and dun crash due to the adrenaline hmmmmm. Also it would be kinda awkward of me now to rescind my words after my energetic objection the last time. Seriously though best solution is he sells his car, but I know thats impossible cos I know his job requires the car.

#98517,17/6/2021,"Have seen some posts about local uni graduates looking down on those who came from private  universities. Although I graduated from a local university, I would say that my decision to enter one was more because my parents have the very same mindset and believe that I will not be able to find a job as easily if I did not graduate with a local uni degree. When in reality, private universities like SIM, Kaplan etc. offer a much shorter route and the endpoint is more or less similar - which is to get a degree. I have many friends who are of the same age as me but make a monthly income of around $800-$1000 more than I do even though they hold a private degree. That 2 year headstart that they get in their careers is worth more than the additional 2 years I spent in University, not to mention the extra school fees as well. A degree from SIM costs easily half as much as a local uni. And as times change, I can see that employers are also moving away from the stigma that local University graduates are better.-#98517: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98517",0,3,0,0,2,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#98491,17/6/2021,"Regarding #98447Actually, I prefer it if companies ask algo questions instead of nonsense like ""What is your greatest weakness"" or ""Tell me an experience you managed a conflict in your team"". Personally, I am very good at this kind of algo interviews as compared to those kind of behavioral interviews considering how socially inept I am. Its also better than asking trivia questions like do you know what is a 2 way TCP handshake or how does your OS prevent deadlocking. At least with algo, you can derive it from first principles. It is better than those build a twitter clone with XYZ tech stack within 24hours as it doesn't take up hours of your time and can be outsourced anyways if you know the right people. You also don't have to watch youtube tutorials to figure out how to use the tech stack required for the interview. Algorithmic based interviews are just the cleanest and most effective imo.However, I do acknowledge that the issue with algo interviews is that they can be grinded to an extent. If I were the interviewer, I would probably come up with unique algo questions you won't be able to find on leetcode and require actual ingenuity. Maybe an IQ test would help as well.-#98491: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98491",11,2,0,0,4,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#98486,17/6/2021,"Can anyone give me advice how to deal with an unambitious partner? Don’t get me wrong, my boyfriend is not some lazy bum who is jobless and sits at home doing nothing. We both have been working for 3 years and he is an executive at some MNC. We are currently earning about 4.5k each. He is an unambitious and lowkey guy at work who just does enough to keep his job but doesn’t aim for more. Once, his boss wanted to put him on the company’s leadership track but he rejected. He has also been approached by a headhunter offering him a higher paid but more intensive job and he rejected as well. The reason he gave is that he just wants an easy life at work (which he currently is) and doesn’t want more stress.  After work, he just comes home to relax and play games, netflix etc while I see some of my friends around my age who are taking part time masters/ online courses or doing side hustles etc. Character wise, he has everything a girl can ask for in a partner- kind, caring, fillial, humorous and considerate. But his unambitious side is really what kept bugging me. Given his credentials- FCH, high IQ, good ppl skills and he can speak well professionally, I know he has the potential to achieve so much more. Now he’s just putting his career on autopilot simply put. I know it’s hard to change a person’s nature but should I just accept him for who he is? I know that if I settle with him, I will always live with the idea that he could have achieved much more but never went out to.-#98486: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98486",169,32,0,0,35,100,0,10,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#98483,17/6/2021,"Nus is indeed good based on its ranking and reputation. But in recent years, nus also known for its reputation of sexual offences and how the school deals with such cases. In all honesty, everyone knows NUS name isn't that outstanding anymore due to the sexual misconduct cases and i suggest you all to stay low and not make fun of others cos the tables can be turned. I myself come from NUS and have interned with students from other unis such as smu or even private unis. But I've seen for myself those coming from private unis also work just as hard and in fact they have very good working attitudes. So this may be the answer to some of your questions as to why some of private uni students land jobs that are from MNCs or FAANG while some of us don't.Just a tip for anyone who is reading, be it nus, ntu or smu or private uni students. Do change your attitude of looking down on others, cos you like it or not, in the working world, you have to work with diverse groups of people. Once you're in the company, no one cares which uni you are from but how your attitude amd character determines your promotion.

#98479,17/6/2021,"Hi, I do have a problem which may need some useful suggestions… I would appreciate for the help.Well 3 months ago… I wrote long essays for days just to ask my friend (let it be M ) some past events… which seriously upset me though I didn’t dare to tell him… in long essays… then M scolded me for it and blocked me…The reason it turned everything so toxic and in long essays is when we just knew each other… M really confused me… we both   talked every day and study together and eat together every day after M got my IG…. Non stop for months… M did do and say something which confused me, such as being too caring to me like scolding me when I forgot to carry extra cash for food, not informing him this and that, never informed him when I go and eat alone at school, would be very sad when I ignored him,(especially a day when M bought me a waffle and I turned down, M looked super disappointed, then when I alerted, I gave him a drink and told him I bought purposely in the morning. M was happy and excited and happily introduced his friends to me and said we will all be very good friends in the future, which further confused me), initiating physical touch… and some flirty things in messages… which really made me feel confused and not knowing how to treat him…reason that made me super imbalanced is M explained to me M and L are just friends when I saw they both always together after some times…but then allowing L to put the a photo where they hold each other’s hands L profile picture on a messaging app while talking to me everyday… that made me feel really inferior…and L told me they aren’t couple as well… which made me feel more disrespected… cuz I confessed M said M  still want to be single… when i tried to put down my pride and be just like usual before we fought last time… I still got cold shoulder… it’s like I need to initiate then he bothers, but then he would constantly put on something on ig story just nice when I feel bad by deleting messages…(main reason is I really feel sad but don’t feel like giving myself stress as well by thinking about it),our mutual friend (L) also told me M treats L in the same way ( I mean very nice and over caring) as well, but L did tell me M made her misunderstand before as well… I know I’m not right in not respecting him for writing long essay which he doesn’t like as well…whenever I deleted messages and disappeared awhile just bcuz I need to settle my emotions for having my own space cuz I don’t want to be confused but then I would turn out to be he thought I was angry with him for not getting any responses from him bah… but I do feel like being utilised as a toy without any explanations and apology as well… including he would just put something on IG whenever I feel like being isolated which further confused me… though I’m not sure whether it’s for me…and imbalances whenever thinking back those days when M could throw his tantrum to me when M felt unhappy about me… but I would just keep quiet and swallow everything for years until those things really engulfed me and affecting me for almost 1 year… that’s why I decided to ask M about all these (cuz I was too shy to ask so I just put in long essays)… then ended up being scolded cuz he thought long essays from me troubled him and he’s enough…and ghosted me…(every time when something happens M would do this and it makes me more panic… it’s like he’s not willing to communicate, usually my others friends are ok with this and they would be straight, but this one…)but yet I still don’t know how should I do… am I too childish and irritating? Should I put down my pride again and send him what I think which would again hurt me again? Am I really wrong at taking old things that made me feel depressed even until affecting my life by asking him why( I am not blaming him or arguing who is wrong, it’s just a self reflection)?But… if to move on… I would always have a thought “ am I wrong? Is it hurting to him?” I really have no idea on this friendship anymore…or should I just give up this friendship?

#98468,17/6/2021,"I used to have a ex who was very good to me, willing to splurge on me, treat me and my parents very well, treat me with love unconditionally but I had no feelings for him, I thought feelings are something that will fade over time or can be built upon. The only flaws that he has is that he is a little weird, he would usually fap himself and record it on his phone, previously talk to girls on dating apps very desperately when he was single and also walks around his own shop naked and videos it on his phone, also he likes to spend future money using credit cards and when he spends he is a very big spender, he will buy facial packages over 3k, go for staycations at W hotel, eat at Sentosa, rent sports car etc. He works for his family business and although his qualification is only a diploma holder, he has money to spend extravagantly bcos of his family’s wealth. I’ve tried to ask him to do other things and to improve himself in case his business fails one day but he refuses to improve since he already is comfortable with his golden spoon. Because of that, I left him and met my current husband. My current husband is worse, he has a lot of secrets that I didn’t know before I married him. He was the top sales and earning quite a lot when I knew him, very hardworking with a drive in life. But the only flaw is that his sexual drive is very high and he always forces me to do sexual things on him that I absolutely hate, but bcos I love him, I do it no matter how much I hate it. Fast forward, I got pregnant by him, and only realised that he was cheating on me way before I got pregnant. My parents are very traditional and forced me to marry him to keep the baby as I always wanted a baby and to settle down. I could not accept the cheating nor forgive him but bcos of the baby, i proceeded anyway. After marriage, I found out that he was also spending future money, often borrowing from friends family and loan sharks, and had this history since 10 years back. He also like to convince other people to invest with him (scammer) and has lost almost half a million of money that is not his and that he has to repay. His past history also shows that he likes to watch porn, and his google search shows that he has been to all those dirty massage place before. He has promised that he will change but keeps gaslighting me, habits are hard to change.I plan to divorce with him as my love for him is dying day by day being unappreciated by such a lousy guy. Sometimes, I regret breaking up with my ex and wonder if life would be different having a kid with someone I do not love but a comfortable life. But I would not do anything to change the fact that I love my child to the moon, and without my current husband, I would not have her. Bcos of that, he always threaten to take my kid away if ever we divorce. And he has never paid a single cent for the child expenses so far, only using his cpf for the delivery. Even for the wedding, it was paid by mostly my relatives side angbao. My family hates him to the core bcos he has borrowed money from me and my mum (around 20-40k) total but has paid only a little back. He has also been jobless for almost a year. Even still, I still see hope for him as he keeps lying to me. Recently I bto with him and to my surprise, got it. In the case if we divorce after 3 years, the house will be forfeited and my chances of getting a house next time will decrease. I’m thinking whether I should just tolerate and not talk to him and just treat him like a housemate and sell it after 5 years then divorce. But 5 years is a long time to tolerate and being gaslight or abuse by someone constantly, not being able to move on. He keeps asking me to see a psychiatrist, I feel like I have a slight issue but still can control my actions, after being abused for so long but I feel that his main motive is to make me prove that I’m mentally incapable of taking care of the child. My ex on the other hand bcos his parents divorce no longer has his golden spoon, has to find a job outside and rent his own flat (as I predicted). Was my decisions made wrong? I feel like it’s very hard for me to proceed on and be positive in life after going through so much in barely a year and my decision making process is often clouded with emotions. I hope someone can give me a right advice. What would u do if you are in my position? Bcos I really don’t know what to do anymore.. my husband is not contributing financially, and doesn’t even treat me nice now, and keeps asking for sex. He is only selfish and cares for his own needs.-#98468: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98468",72,14,0,13,0,27,0,16,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
#98467,17/6/2021,"In response to #98422I believe this guy is misunderstanding something. When most normal Singaporeans refer to 'overseas universities' in comparison to NUS, they don't mean Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Oxbridge or whatever ivy our PSC/President Scholars are going to. Usually, they are talking about tier 2 overseas colleges which cater to the lesser people who were rejected by local universities and is going to such lesser overseas universities which are usually very expensive but unlike the true global elite universities, have somewhat subpar academic standards. From my personal experience coming from one of the so called 'elite' JC, in that environment, if you go to NUS or local universities, you are seen as kind of a failure, a person who cannot make it to the true elite ranks of Oxbridge or the Ivies. Personally, I still feel envy at my peers who is studying in those places while I am stuck here. I assure you, almost all Singaporeans know that those schools you mention are infinitely better than NUS. However, the Australian universities, or tier 2/3 US/UK colleges that people go to when NUS rejects them? Well, I think it is right to say, they really aren't the best. You mention the point of our ministers being educated in overseas colleges. This is true, but as I mentioned they went to the top elite global universities like Cambridge or Harvard, not some XXX State College. Also bear in mind that in the past, like 30-40 years ago when our ministers had their education, NUS was nowhere close to where it is today. To put it bluntly, it was a 3rd world university with 3rd world resources! A lot has changed since then and, if you see our parliament lineup as of late, the majority of the younger parliamentarians were from local universities like NUS or NTU.Lastly, I would like address the stigma of this private vs public university thing. Firstly, we cannot compare the situation in Singapore with the situation in USA. It is true that in the USA, their private universities are the best and most highly sought after. But that is due to their system and long history.  All the top private elite colleges have centuries of history and alumni funding. It is not easy to build a world class university in a matter of decades. The only reason why NUS/NTU are able try to compete is because they have a lot of backing and support by the government.  Do you think S*M or J*** C*** or whatever have that chance? Furthermore, even if they are offshoots of overseas colleges they are usually built with the incentive of raising funds for the parent college by relying on the brand name. Do you think that the UOL here is remotely close in standard as the UOL in the UK? Not even close! The cohorts are graded on 2 separate curves to begin with!So yes, I don't disagree with you that NUS is no where as good as the true big league overseas universities and I don't think anyone would disagree! Just that, I think you could be misunderstanding the divide over local vs overseas universities and what it really represents.-#98467: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98467",24,3,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I have spoken to him about it a few times and it seems like he’s having issues staying erected (strangely no more morning wood as well) or he says he would rather just cuddle. Told him to see a doctor but he simply brushes me off every time.I also noticed these days he’s been looking at thirst traps on Instagram, something I never noticed when we were dating.

Similar professions like (traditional) engineering do not have this kind of weird interview process, and their interviews test more on stuff like past project experience, general people skills etc., which IMO, is a MUCH better predictor of success on the job.

#98445,17/6/2021,"I have a dilemma that I need to solve ... I broke off with my 5years long term relationship ex half a year ago as he was being mentally abusive to me, example if something doesn't goes his way he would shout at me although in his context he was just raising his voice. The relationship became very toxic and I decided to walk away from it as it was either break up or marriage if I were to continue staying on in this relationship. 4months after the breakup he had zero contact with me leaving me very much heartbroken as I was still very much in love with him. I tried moving on by going on dates and meeting friends constantly keeping my mind occupied but My parents being kpo and not yet over the fact we broken up as i never told them the bad things he does to me and thinking we are making a mistake decided to invite him over for a family gathering one day. Surprised that he agreed to come it was the first time in 2 months since we last spoken, we had a serious conversation and found out that both of us was not over but both was too scar to take a step forward to do anything.... emotions came pouring out both of us feeling vulnerable and alcohol to blame we spent the night together. But after that night I realised we can never be together as old scars will never heal and it would be a mistake a try again. A month later my friend decided to tell me about his feeling for me. He had been there for me since the last year of my relationship with my ex and In a way he was a shoulder I could cry on and always lent his ear for me to rant since whenever I want to complain about things to my ex or was upset he would tell me Im overreacting and just playing the pity card ????, still being with my ex I didn't think anything much of his action aside from him being a good friend. After thinking about it for awhile I decided to give it a go and just try out this relationship.. Overtime I grew to really loving him and loving the way he treats me although he doesn't have much compared to my ex but atleast he treats me well... when everything seems to be going well I was hit with a news that u was pregnant. And it was definitely my ex as I have yet to done it with him. I told him about it and instead of being mad or asking me to abort it he hugged me and told me everything is going to be alright and if I ever decide to keep it he will raise it with me like his own If I want to abort he will be with me throughout the whole process.  He asked whether do I want to tell my ex about it and what do I want to do.. part of me find that it's only right to tell him about this child yet a part of me thinks I shouldn't as I have no intention of raising it with him if I were to ever keep it, after all a child wouldn't just magically solve our problems. At the end of the day I decided to keep it with my boyfriend and to never let the child know about his real father but my plans got ruin when my ex found out about the kid and insist on marrying me and raising the child together saying it's his birth rights to do so as he is the biological father  and that things might change now he will change for me and the baby .. he wants to file a lawsuit if we don't agree and will do whatever legal means to gain rights over me and the child.  Am I doing the right thing for my child? Should the child really grow up with the biological parents ? Should I give him another chance for the sake of the child..... even if it means gambling my happiness away.  Saying my boyfriend can never give the child everything that he can as he is a lawyer with a high paying income and my boyfriend just earning an average income. The child will be better off being able to choose to go to any school he wants and go and expensive vacations having all the toys he desire in the world and not being held back just because mummy and daddy can't afford... with all this drama going on I'm slowly sinking into depression and thinking maybe I should just get rid of the problem... if the child is gone..all this problems will be gone....

I knew they will be happy if they see me on stage although its just a ceremony because is something to be happy for them as we come from a low income family. I started working since i was 14 to work for my own allowances and pay for school fees. Its really a long journey for me and i know my parents know that i work really hard too.

#98442,17/6/2021,"To the guy behind #98346: i believe we are in the same situation and facing a scam. I've also matched with a guy on tinder and spoke for more than a month now. I've been on and off dating apps for years and thought ​finally there's someone that I could talk to for so long. I found it a little weird when he started introducing some investment trading thing. But for me, i never had interest so i brushed it off. Our convos went back to normal but somehow it will always go back to asking me to do it. He mentioned that it's for a better future and also at least we have a common thing that we are doing together. It's weird because there's so many things to do together so why he have to be so hung up on this. I took 2 days off talking to him and weighing out the different possibilites - whether this is a scam or not. My situation was more confusing because he wasn't using a business number and we actually spoke on the phone a few times. Decided to give myself closure by confronting him about this and tell him that i am not interested and i felt very pressured by him. I am okay to find out more and do it but not now when we are currently just internet pals. Why should i trust someone whom i dont even know in real life, especially since money is involved. Things sort of went back to normal but 2 days later, he brought it up again. I think it has been a little clearer to me now. Up till today, i have no idea how he looks like (only from his tinder pics), he doesn't seem to have any intentions of meeting up despite him being in SG. If he truly wants to date me as he claims, he would not force me to do this or at least will be okay to wait till i am comfortable enough. He was always patronizing in convos but i thought it was just guys being guys. But always more passionate and reply faster when talking about the investment shit. Even though up till now i still hope that he was real and genuinely wants to share something with me, but I think that confrontational talk was also a last chance that i gave myself to test him out. The girl in your case is not even in SG, so just continue keeping your guards real high. Don't download any scammy links they send, don't send the money. Don't do anything. 2 can play the game. If she is a real scammer, she won't be able to stay for long. Otherwise, just find someone else to talk to.

I met someone recently and we clicked very well and are thinking of advancing. Both of us come from medium income family and only just started working in a non fix income job*. So the future is pretty uncertain. I’m fine with it because I was always the kind who who is willing to stand by my partner and build a future together but what my mum & best friend said made me a little worried.My mother and best friend kept saying that since I’m already 25, I should focus on finding someone by analysing them instead of letting feelings take front seat. And by that she meant to find someone who is richer. It is a luxury that im single at this age because I wont be blinded by young love. I do look at their character and all but somehow money isn’t my priority….Cos I had another guy who was interested in me and he, although just started working with not much money, he has a lot of potential inheritance from his parents and grandpArents (he is definitely getting the $$). However after going out with him previously I honestly do not like his habits and personality as a partner so I rejected him.My mum and best friend were disappointed in me. So I started reflecting on myself which is what I need advice on.Can I ask - am I too childish with my thinking? To want to build a future with a guy. That I don’t really judge if they are money “poor” at this point, that I believe with hardwork, one can always make it. Am I not being practical? Is there not enough time to build a future since im already 25 already? I’m really afraid of course that my partner doesn’t make it eventually…. ***and not that I rely entirely on him but I’ve heard so many divorces because it takes two people to raise a family.

They basically manage a relatively large portfolio of assets (think in the low tens of millions), mostly in real estate. These assets generate revenue, and over time, they appreciate. This business will be passed on to me in its entirety because I’m the only child. There’s really not much grunt work required in this business. Most of the work is done by hired lawyers, bankers, and accountants. There is some work to be done when we buy or sell assets, there is work to be done when tenants come and go, but these things are irregular. On most weeks, I seem like I’m not doing anything.

When my family and I moved to sentosa, we ran into him more. Therefore , he knows my family- my husband and my kids. I am working in  insurance industry in Singapore and in June 2020 , he said he will open and an account with me . He asked me to go over to his place, saying that his wife does not allow me him to go out. He has a 6 funny looking houses in south cove sentosa and stays in one. His family- wife and 4 kids stay in another house. He goes over back and forth between the houses. For the longest time, he has told me that his wife and him have problems and many issues. I told my husband of the problems IC faced and my husband and I usually told him- to take it easy. When he asked me to come over in June to sign the account opening, he grabbed my hand. I pulled my hand away and told him not to do that. He smiled sheepishly and then continued signing the account opening forms. There were only the 2 of us at his residence. After that incident, he would always stand near me, sit next to me, touch my shoulder. I had to do work so I had to still see him for account signing and proposal of ideas. I did not think much of it. As I believe naively since he knows my family, he won’t do me any harm. In December, when I had to go over , he locked the door and asked me to go up to the study room. He forced me to perform a sexual act on Him- a blowjob. I was too embarrassed and ashamed to tell anyone this- even my husband. Worse still, a few days later, I had ulcers at my private region and when I saw my gynecologist - she confirmed I have HSV1 . This pervert is well known to have STDs - hsv1 and hsv2  or maybe even worse.His ex wife “ Wendy “second wife has shared this with almost everyone she knows and therefore he has spread this to me knowingly that he would pass it to me. I would like to have this person exposed as I do not believe I’m the only victim and there must be many other ladies he has preyed on in leading them and trapping them .When I shared this incident with his wife, she did not seem surprised and as she knows her husband only too well.

#98399,17/6/2021,"In response to #98303:I think I can talk about this from a guy's perspective (well actually just from my perspective, since clearly I can't speak for all guys).I think there are two possible reasons. The first is that they felt intimidated by you, like some of the comments suggested. However, I think the second reason is far more likely. It is that you are not conforming to expectations, and they felt that you were mocking them. Academic circles are extremely tightly knit, especially in the STEM fields. I've had casual conversations with professors/lecturers, and the were referring to their own PhD supervisors as their (academic) ""parents"", ""grandparents"", and collaborators as their ""brothers"" and ""sisters"". Studying for a PhD is like trying to join this family. Right now, you are a complete outsider to this family, and by asking very detailed questions on their work, it feels like you are trying to barge in and be adopted. You say that you know what you are talking about, but to them, you don't. Many of them have spent years working towards their area of interest (possibly gained interest in JC/poly, worked towards it in 4 years undergrad plus did some research projects along the way). You mentioned that you talked to 3 different guys doing engineering, quantum chemistry, and computing respectively. imo it is highly unlikely that you were able to match their knowledge in all of those areas.I've had a similar experience with someone recently. This person kept asking me highly technical questions (Mayer Vietoris Sequences) but it soon became clear from her responses that she didn't have the prerequisite knowledge (what is a normal subgroup?). She didn't know what she was talking about, but only pretended to know. It felt like she were trying to learn certain ""key words and key phrases"" just to impress me or something, and I was certainly not very impressed. To me, she sounded like ""that smart alec in class"" bragging about how they already know all the course material, but upon closer inspection, only knows things on a superficial level to look good. Younger me in my JC/Undergrad days would have been hit with a severe bout of imposter syndrome, but now I know how to keep myself together. These experiences are still very mentally draining and I don't want to be dating this sort of person long term.I wanted to ghost her right there right then, but decided to entertain my inner psychopath a bit more, by playing the same card back. I slowly steered the conversation to her interests and area of study, and away from mine. Then, I scrutinized everything they said, and asked highly specific questions about tiny details and technicalities. Needless to say, her tone became increasingly agitated and she got pissed off after a while. She then ghosted me shortly after.I probably sound like a freak right now, but I hope I have made my point clear.-#98399: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98399",0,1,0,0,6,14,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

#98397,17/6/2021,"Hi admin, please share this as I feel that this is a matter of public interest.I am disappointed and puzzled at how NUS medicine is approaching this pandemic.I am a parent of a year 3 going to year 4 medical student in NUS medicine. This coming Saturday, the cohort will be having a formative clinical examination (formative meaning the marks for the exam will not be included in the grade for the academic year). To provide a context, the clinical exam consists of medical students being in a room with a patient (in this exam, it would be a standardised patient i.e. sort of a ‘healthy’ actor) and an examiner (who is a doctor). Students are then rotate to different rooms in a round robin fashion.Granted, the school had made some preparations with regards to this exam.(1) Students will be split into smaller groups and are to report to multiple venues with no mingling. However, I am not certain if students of different reporting venues will be meeting the same patient/doctor. From my understanding, there might be a chance where students of different reporting venues will be meeting the same patient/doctor for the exam in their respective examination rooms. This mingling of students, standardised patients and doctors only creates room for a disaster to unfold. I am not sure if the doctors all belong to the same healthcare cluster. If they are not, the school is encouraging unnecessary mingling of the public with the hospitals. And if they are, they are also encouraging mingling of the public and that healthcare cluster. All this coupled with the emergence of new COVID clusters recently, will make us vulnerable to a potential new NUS/hospital COVID cluster.(2) Students are made to undergo a COVID swab, likely the antigen rapid tests (ART). This should be similar to the pre-event testing rolled out by MOH where people attending the examination are made to do a swab. According to a factsheet published by MOH on 20 Oct 2020, the ARTs minimally meet the WHO’s recommendation of at least 80% sensitivity. Meaning, they can only pick up at least 80% of individuals who are infected with COVID-19. As a non-medical pre-event testing, it should be sufficient. But for this clinical exam, where doctors from (possibly different) hospitals are involve (hospitals which houses sick patients and had a history of having a TTSH cluster), one would expect a higher sensitivity test.In addition, because of this exam, I heard from my daughter that a lot of students gather at each other houses/school (legally of course) to practice physical examination techniques. I feel that this encourages social interaction and is putting our students at risk.While I do understand why Singapore opened to Phase 3 HA as they had to prevent “many businesses to fold” as elaborated by Minister Lawrence Wong, I do not understand why the school is insisting on holding this big scale examination at this present moment when there are other opportune chances in the future when things get better (which is very possible given the rate we are vaccinating the population). Currently, even the government is “buying time to speed up vaccination programme”. If I may, it is a little irresponsible for the school to carry on with the exam. There is really not much benefit for the school to hold this examination (also note that the result of the exam will not affect the promotion of students to year 4). Offhand, other opportune time would be during recess week or at the end of the academic year during the students’ 14 weeklong elective.I hope more thought can be put when planning such big scale events.Disclaimer: all information is written to the best of my knowledge.

But I am starting to picture how it would be like if I were to become their DIL. I try my best to smile and accommodate to them however ridiculous their actions are. For example, while we are eating, it suddenly becomes a food judging session whereby I am questioned about how the food tastes, how does it compare to other brands, discuss about the ingredients used (whether it’s good or bad quality) and having to state the reason for every answer I give. And if they dislike the food, they’d ask me to identify what the problem is even if I personally liked it. throughout the time when I see them, they would just bombard me with weird and uncomfortable questions. Basically, they are just questioning every decision I make be it clothing choice or food choice, it can be literally anything.

Especially since most stores are having sales, it will attract more people to the stores. But please be nice to the salespeople and shop with their feelings in mind. Why tho?Well, simply because they are earning minimum wage while attending to various customers' demands, whilst trying to keep the store clean and tidy. Additionally, there's a shortage of manpower and longer working hours, which is exhausting for retail workers who are running around the store.

(Friends had to private their IG & hide their stories from him as well)•In the later part of our relationship, he even controlled the time I get to spend with my family. • I can never be late to meeting him, which means I can never sleep in on a weekend. I had to set an alarm for 9am whenever we were meeting, while he would still be asleep till 3pm. Still he gave me shit whenever I turn up past 12 noon. • A date would turn into staying at home, playing games and sex. • He would go through my phone in secret and confront me whenever he did not like what he read. • He would always arrive late and leave early at my family gathering, but I was not allowed that privileges at his family gathering. • Whenever he leaves my family gathering, I was expected to leave as well. • Towards the end of our relationship, whenever we were on dates - he would be on his phone all the time. Barely any interaction. Still that was my fault?!?!?• He would question my decision to relocate overseas and gave me shit for doing so. • He would ask his mom for it money when he’s broke. (He was 22 and still did that, yikes.)• Used Find My Friends to track my location when I was overseas. Basically I was to be at home or at Uni, anywhere else he would call and text me demanding to know the reason why. If I were to switch it off, threats would come in. • I would self-harm from time to time, just cause it was taking a toll on me emotionally. Initially, he felt guilt and changed his attitude towards me. But, he would used it as a ammunition and blackmail me into doing things for him otherwise he would snitch on me. You see this?• Also, he tried to propose to see if I would ditch a bright future and stay with him and be a slave to him• Then asked if I wanna BTO with him, and his parents will pay the downpayment as a gift.Decided to finally dump his ass cause he went full on crazy and blocked me on various messaging app, cause I fell asleep while browsing facebook and could not reply to his messages. I did message him back, but he blocked me and the message did not went through lel. Dumbass.

They were so excited over the food and one even said it's her favourite dish. I bought 4 live sri lankan crabs home and waited for my friends to arrive before processing them because I wanted to keep the food fresh.When my friends came, they were shocked that I bought live crabs. I told them it's for freshness. The friend who said chilli crab was her favourite dish started arguing with me, calling me a murderer.I told her to look away and proceeded to kill the crabs swiftly with a knife up the bottom and she started crying. My other friends were split, with one supporting her and saying I'm a monster, while the other said I am just doing what every restaurant does.I called her a hypocrite for eating crabs at a restaurant even though she can't stand the crabs being killed, and she couldn't come out with a proper reply. Needless to say the gathering sucked and she ran home crying with one other friend.

I brought card games so that things won't be so boring and she just said it's ok (with a very uninterested tone), before ignoring me coldly and used her phone and texted all day long makes me feel even more helpless and angry.. Our interactions are quite limited throughout the 3 days and it was damn awkward so much so that I have thoughts of leaving her alone in the hotel not more than once.

I thought of having the both of us having a hot and great shower together vanished no matter how much I plead and I am stuck outside the bathroom until she is done.We slept on 2 separate beds and I wanted to combine the 2 beds into 1 by pushing the beds together so that we can be closer.

#98367,17/6/2021,"I got riled up enough to write this post today so here it is.To all mothers of boys or men who has raised them, please just please let us off. In this day and age, we would like to have freedom of speech and choice.Please stop cornering us with ""Can we take your babies? Can we come to see them anytime?""We understand your need to helicopter your precious son. Please understand that your grandkids are OUR kids and we would love to raise them ourselves in a certain way, much like how you guys raised your kids in your own ways. Your son is not perfect and neither am I, but we will try our utmost best to pass down the good morals and habits to our kids. Remember, its our kids now, its our time now, its not yours anymore. Your son has grown up and he has his own quirks and bad habits, he has his own personality and preferences and temper. He may be terrible at cleaning up after himself, but thats because you pick up after him all the time. I am not perfect either, but when we become parents, we will find our own ways. You can give us advice, but do so at moderation, and tell us in a way we can accept, rather than ""i will help you do laundry, iron my son's work shirts, and clean your house"". No. I will not allow you because the same way I want him to learn, i want my children to have discipline and learn that the world does not fall by their feet. I want my children to learn, not to be indulgent and lazy, and to not take my traits of stubbornness too. I understand I have faults, and your son will correct then from your grandkids, not you. It is our time, yours have passed. Its time for you to take a step back.To all mothers-in-law, regardless of how good you think your son is, it is very rude to be condescending to us. We get that you gave up your youth and possibly job to take care of him, but in this current landscape and economy, its hard for one of us to quit to be a homemaker. We understand your son earns more than us, but it is not right to insult us that we can't do work or earn much just because your son works longer hours. It is not only rude, it hurts our feelings. We have a difficult time at work and we are here to see your son, we try to respect you and have you around to include you too, but its too rude for you to say all these condescending words. We understand we are not your children so our achievements mean nothing in comparison to your son, but bear in mind, if your son chose to marry us, your grandkids will have our genes too. To all mothers in law, can we remind you that your son is a fully grown adult. He knows how to take care of himself without you around. You don't have to keep reminding us how to do things the way you did, or whether you know his body best because you took care of him the whole time, because he is an adult and he will be the father to my kids. He has to set a good example and be the role model to my children, and I wouldn't want my children to wonder and develop any complexes due to your over-smothering and over-helicopter parenting style. I also do not have the time and energy to clean, cook, give birth, do everything for my children and treat your son like my 1st born manchild. He is a grown ass man, stop it, its embarrassing.All in all, all daughters in law in the world will respect you, as long as you give them basic human respect too. We are also our own parents' princesses, and we are also someone's daughter. Same as what you have experienced, we want things to be different. Afterall, it is a different era and time. Its time for you to take a step back and let go. They always say married ladies have no home, it is true because if we are wronged by our in laws, we can't go back to our own parents too. Afterall, we are married. Why can't this apply to your son? Even in birds and other animals, building a means we both leave our nest to build a new home by ourselves. Marriage means we form a nuclear family, and its me and him starting one. Please give us your blessings and cut the invisible umbilical cord. He will after all grow up to be a man, a father, a grandfather and of course, a husband. He is your son, but he is much more roles to our family. Similarly, by right I will enter your family, so if you could respect everyone else, why must you treat me differently with harsh words?I will treat you like my own mother, sharing with you what I have, my troubles, my happiness and joy, as long as you acknowledge that we are also human beings. We want our own life, freedom, and own right to build our own family. And for that, to all mothers in law in the world, we daughters in law will be grateful.-#98367: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98367",40,33,0,37,0,156,15,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

I think I have a nice personality (typical nice guy), but I’m not exactly attractive nor good at conversations, hence my doubts on my own success over TinderAnyway, matched with a really pretty lady very quickly on my first night of using, whom I thought was quite out of my league based on appearance. She’s not from the SEA region, and not entirely chinese speaking, just to eliminate your stereotype countries. Our conversations are still ongoing albeit slow, but all these while, I kept wondering if it was some sort of elaborate scam or if there was some hidden agenda. Mainly because I kept thinking if this match was too good to be true. We spoke a lot on the digital market, and she shared her successful experience and encouraged me to get started. I was slowly picking up abit of knowledge on my own and was already planning do so in the future, so it wasn’t hard to convince me about how lucrative it was. There wasn’t any hard sell from her but throughout, I was extremely wary, like just to protect myself if it actually turned out to be some sort of financial scam. Which might actually also explain this match. We exchanged contact (she initiated), but I don’t think it was her personal number. I’m fine if it isn’t, as I totally believe it’s for her own safety. But at the same time, am unsure if it was a red flag. It was a business account too. So anyway I’m in a really confused stage. Large part of me is hoping something can develop so I’m still trying to put in effort,  but another large part of me is raising my shields really really high.(I believe in long distance, so I’m not writing it off so quickly based on location) And me being me, my thoughts brought this further to wonder if I do seriously have some trust issues, and if I’m destined to just screw up any future possible relationships.-#98346: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98346",41,6,0,0,17,14,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

#98347,17/6/2021,"[A story about my father]I grew up in a broken family - my mother divorced with my father when my sister and I were 10 & 8years old respectively. My mother was seeing someone else then and had remarried shortly after the divorce. We were often told and taught by our paternal grandmother to tell the judge@the family court about our wish to follow our father should there be a need to go through court trial. But guess what, we don't have to go through our worse fear as a child of choosing between mother or father as our mother give up on us (at least we were told this way through our growing years). You must be wondering what has that got to do with my father, and on this special day? My father who is a person of few words has not spoken a bad word about my mother all these years. Taking care of 2 daughters as a single dad is not easy. With the absence of a wife to look after the children while you were away for work, my grandmother were rope in to care for us on a more permanent basis.Financially, we weren't doing well as my father was neither highly educated nor having a high paying job. Out of goodwill, my grandmother did not expect much from him and accept the child allowance he could afford.To make matter worse, with the increasingly amount of freedom cum loneliness, my dad made an unwise decision to mix with bad company whom introduced him to drugs. He started to default the child allowance and often asked my grandmother for money. Many times, my grandmother just give in to him (reluctantly) as those were his savings she claimed. As true as Karma is a bitch, my dad was soon arrested and imprisoned for a few years due to drug abuse offence. All these happens within a 2years period while I felt so distraught as I've yet come to terms of the parents divorce yet have to face with the idea of my absence father. As a result, our relationship got more distant. During his time of imprisonment, my grandmother will bring us to the prison to visit him. A few years has passed and he was imprisoned another time for contraband cigarettes related offence. The second time I was slightly less affected than the first time he went in.  Moving forward to recent years, he seems to have changed for the better. On thing I saw was he started contributing to the household expenses although he wasn't earning much as a free-lancer. There are times we still quarrel over finances especially during COVID-19 period when his job was affected. During then, my married sister and I provide him with some ad-hoc contribution but at some point I felt that he should at least made an attempt to look for a more stable job instead of being too dependent on us who are low income earners. The pandemic also made us realized the need to plan ahead financially. Thank goodness my father has a 3room flat which has been vacant for awhile. Every time I suggested he rents out, he seems dismissive but the economic downtown indeed serve as a wake up call for him such that he decided to rent out the unit. With his rental income and free-lance income, I can finally be less worry about him. Over the years, we also grow slightly closer than before as I saw he's trying to help out the household expenses although I still struggle with flashbacks from the bitter past. I am thankful I have other family members I can look up to, peer and religious support these years which I can seek advise from when I'm feeling lost. Often, we heard the saying that ""we can't choose our parents but we can decide on the future we want"". Today, I still stand by that saying and hope to take this chance to encourage those with similar pasts that you can live better than your yesterday. Alas, I want to wish all fathers of the pasts, current and future - Happy father's day ~ and thank you for the big and small sacrifices you've made and systemically impacting us in the community.

#98335,17/6/2021,"I love being a pharmacist. I love serving my patients dedicatedly. I enjoy seeing them get well or empowered to take care of themselves. I believe pharmacists are able to help support doctors better  and do a lot more for our patients by humbly learning in our course of work from the doctors and patients, continuously enriching ourselves by going for Masters, Pharm D, National Collaborative Prescribing Course. While those bright sparks of pharmacy have achieved a lot and share the pride and passion of pharmacy, they are the rare fews blessed with good mentors, opportunities and being in the profession at the right time while they dedicated their time to do what many others did too. The majority are not that lucky. After a decade of work and freely “volunteering” my time while being grossly underpaid yet trying to be idealistic and believe one does not need to be overly rich because that cost will translate to higher healthcare costs, should I accept it that my institution does not value a decade of work experience as compared to a fresh pharmacist? The salary of a fresh grad is so much better than someone in the system for ten with more experience experience. While the ten year pharmacist is able to serve patients better and often gets compliments from the patients for the good care they received, the institutions believe this is EXPECTED of a pharmacist day-to-day work and hence does not justify a promotion or pay rise. While doctors get pay increment for every formal education they received, it does not work so for a pharmacist. The university promotes pharmacy as a course. The national pharmacy landscape paints an ideal picture of so much things pharmacy can improve. Yet, on the ground, everyday the Pharmacy managers tell their staff the things they do are redundant because it is not money generating. The staff is spending too much time when the reality is the staff is expected to make things happen with so little resources and expected to make the impossible happen. At the end of the day, the pharmacy managers say all these efforts are day to day efforts, insufficient to promote or get a pay rise. When you see the truth and ask to spend time not doing there work considered redundant by the administrators and ask what will get you promoted or given a pay rise, no strong answer is given. Because, the truth is, as a pharmacist, all you need to do is ensure timely and safe supply of medicines. It is that basic. Counseling is additional. Time spent with patient is not money generating to the pharmacy but a cost incurred to the pharmacy. The work is truly mundane and perhaps redundant as the administrators say it. So, to the young ones out there, if you can still U-turn, choose a different profession. Things will not get better unless society acknowledges and is willing to pay for a pharmacists’ service like in other countries. In the mean time, we are just a bunch of useful but free resource to be exploited. Can any strongly passionate person not be jaded after being abused by the never improving system for so long ? Share if you know of any organizations who treat and value their pharmacy staff better.-#98335: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98335",1,1,0,2,0,5,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#98332,17/6/2021,"This is in response to post #98230. Warning, it is a long post ahead.Firstly, I am appalled by the comments. OP, please please do not be disheartened when you read through the many negative comments. I don’t think the situation you are in is one that many can relate to. More importantly I think many might be misunderstanding on real problem here.The issue at hand is that you feel pent up and resentment. You’re doing your best you can at securing a well-paying job despite juggling the young children and managing the household. It is an unfair situation because your husband, who is earning a similar amount, get his hands off the kids and household. Love aside, marriage is a partnership. It is not about making equal contributations because everyone have different strengths and weaknesses. It’s about both parties making similar levels of effort in maintaining and growing the family, it’s the comradeship of going through tough times together that is held by the core vision of the couple to want to work through the obstacles in life together. But, it’s not there because of your husband’s lack of interest in the family and the bigger picture. (Sorry to say this but it sounds like your husband is not very mature even in his 30s. That’s ok - mine isn’t too, but I still love him to bits till today after decades of married life together)If your partner is not involved with household and children management, one can only pray that he/she is more successful career-wise. Why? Not because the family needs more money and not doing well financially (OP has clearly stated - why are commenters still harping on this?) If you are OP and overwhelmed with handling everything, would you feel more sad if this was because (1) partner working hard to support family, long working hours and cannot help out, or too stressed and tired so need to unwind with videos, OR (2) partner is plainly refusing to help out because he prioritizes his me-time over the family, and the wife’s physical and emotional well-being. The first situation would render much more fairness to OP’s situation, right?To commenters who ask OP to delegate child-related duties to the husband: you probably won’t understand how it’s like until you are in the situation. Yes you can tell your husband to do specific chores, and he probably will do them. But you might only be able to delegate him a few things that he can do properly. More importantly, every time you need to ask him to help, it is  saddening. Because he is more pre-occupied with his own interests (in other words, does not prioritize his family), he cannot see for himself what needs to be done and what the wife needs help in. And OP, from your post, I can tell that you are a capable lady. You probably have been able to manage things on your own since the beginning; which could be why your husband didn’t get into right mindset and became how he is like today. You can try to remind him that every little thing in the house that he chooses to ignore, has to be done by you (unless you have helper lah). Tell him that you’re not coping and you NEED his help. If he still has some love for you more than his videos (and has any bit of ego), trust me, this will help him to take more initiative. But this increased involvement would be out of love for you - I would think that since he is inherently not very family oriented or inclined, this part is hard to change lah.Oh yes, please do not expect your husband to be able to become more ambitious or family-oriented. As much as how that would solve everything, it is just not possible. My husband was just like yours, OP. I hated him during the dark days because I felt unfair at our uneven contributions to the family and at the same time, battered by the holy trinity of full-time work, household chores and managing kids. I tried to imagine if a divorce would be the solution. It was a plausible option because after a divorce, the actual work I had to do was the same, but one less “child” to take care of and most importantly, I will be free of the emotional burden of having to deal with the pent-up resentment. But I did not go ahead with a divorce, because I could foresee a ridiculous situation in which as a divorcee, I would still date my ex-husband. Our love was still there. Or rather, I didn’t resent him strongly enough to overpower the love. But this was in my personal situation, may not be applicable to others’ situations. You might want to ask yourself whether you love him enough to still hold on, and whether he loves you enough to continue turning a blind eye to your needs.OP, hang in there because things will get better. Your time will be yours again when your children are older and less physically needy. By then, child-related duties are easier so your husband might be able to help you out better. You will find back the time and energy to do things you once love once your kids go to school. Chances are, your resentment for your husband will fade with time on its own without any action on anyone’s end. When you get older, you might just want to relax with your partner and enjoy life instead. Question is whether deep down, you still want to have this future with him? And is this enough to help you pull through the dark times that you are facing right now?Auntie wishes you the best, OP. You are doing well, and you are allowed to feel however you want to feel. (Cry if you have to, but make sure your husband can see, maybe it will wake him up a little)-#98332: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98332",0,0,0,8,0,5,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Neither he has the looks, body and he drinks and smokes as well. During the first few months, he’s very attentive towards me, nice and caring, like what typical couples would go through during the honeymoon stage.After we got together, he became cold, I guess the sweetness wore out. We rarely went out to have a proper date, only dinner and his place typically. I guess we are quite chill about it?Though I mentioned to head out once in awhile, he would ask me to plan everything, which i got the impression that he’s not interested. But ok la, he still help me whenever I needed. All these are fine, just probably I’m quite particular about him not greeting my parents.Only after 2 years, he went up to my place. During the past CNY, he didn’t bother to come over. I’ve tried inviting him over for dinner during non-festive periods, he would just MIA and reply afterwards. I didn’t want to force him to come over, but just wanna to know if this behaviour is normal?Brought this concern of mine to him, and what he told me was, after marriage, with kids and all, we probably don’t see our parents all the time. Ehh idk la, we go over to his place every weekend, but once in a while just chill at my place cannot meh. Ok la, part of me wanted my parents to understand him and help me see see if he’s the right guy too hahaaBut ya, just wanted to know how do I get him to blend in with my family.

The problem is, he stinks. ???? he seldom showers and he stays cooped up in the room most times. It’s so bad that even the living room now stinks. It’s the kind of mouldy old man smell. I love my father a lot and I don’t want to hurt him by telling him something personal like to shower everyday. Small things like this can upset him. Can anyone suggest how I can help to freshen up the room? I’ve put room air freshener, doesn’t work.

#98327,17/6/2021,"Hi, there is this girl who was an intern at my office and then continued to be a full-timer because she was really good at the work. She is actually very pretty, outgoing and extremely caring. There were already 2-3 guys who were chasing her. I mean they switched places just to sit closer to her and they would stay back to help her with her issues.When she was an intern, I did not really pay much attention because most of the time, they would leave within a few months. I just socialised with her just like I would with any other colleague.As I see her more often nowadays, I have started to feel more attracted towards her. I have never dated before because I was too shy/introverted and too focused on studies. I also don't really look good although I am fit. I am lean muscular so you cannot see the definitions without me removing the shirt which absolutely sucks. I do not really know how to approach without being inappropriate. I mean she was an intern here which means I am senior. There is also the problem of the other guys who are constantly chasing her. Recently, there was no one at the office so I asked her if she wanted to go out for lunch with me. However, she turned me down. I felt really bad. I have gone alone with other female colleagues for lunch and I had no issues so far. If she was even remotely interested in me, she would have come with me right? There was also this incident where she forgot to pass me some documents even though she knew I needed them urgently. It kind of shows that she is not interested in me again. I don't know what to do here. Is appropriate to fall for you colleague who was an intern? If I ask her out, would it spoil the relationship? I already failed a simple lunch meeting, how in the world is she going to like me? By the way, how to ask? I don't even know how to ask. Would I creep her out? How do I be attractive to her? How do I impress her? I cannot even get close to her to know her because she is always surrounded by people. Does she even think about me?AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I am going crazy here! I am thinking about her everyday and I even have dreams about her. My heart literally pounded the other day when she walked past me which never happened before. I thought I was really having a heart attack. I feel like I am falling for her more and more everyday. Someone please help here!!!!

Then he asked if I am interested in either of these 2 jobs. I was quite sian by this time so I told him I prefer the marketing assistant role. And then we proceeded with the interview. I find the process weird because he asked me questions like 'tell me a fun fact about yourself', 'what do you do during your free time'. It feels more like date questions.

#98320,17/5/2021,"A true story. I encourage those guys finding their better half not to give up.I met a very nice pretty lady during the time I was doing paid delivery part time. I held a professional full time job as well. Even before meeting her, on the app I told her that I was a criminal who went to prison for 10 years rape. I asked her if she was comfortable if I were to be delivering to her appartment. I did this because I had given up on finding the right woman. So I might as well project a negative image of myself for fun right?Things took a turn. She was the only one who thanked me for my honesty. The others requested that I should not even be dealing where female customers are or that they do not want me there. I also received a number of nasty comments from some women. For the first time I had full experience of what ex convicts experience.Eventually the lady who thanked me and I started dating. I had to live my lie. When we started living together, I would go out of home to work as a storeman only to collect my office clothes at a self-storeage facility, shower in the gym toilet and change into office attire. The whole process was tedious. After work it was drycleaning of my clothes at self service laundry and to the self storeage and then back home. For her my long hours at work were okay as she thought my job was demanding. In fact 4 of the 12 hours I was supposed to be working were spent in the cover up process.We dated on weekends and she did not even ask how I was able to afford some items with my salary. She did not even ask why I did not have to work weekends and public holidays.We rented a room to stay with her paying all of the rent since she thought I did not earn much. Her parents objected to us being together. They told her ""Once a criminal forever a criminal"".Some years passed after we got married. I had enough to by a 5 room HDB flat. I wanted to buy one but I knew it would raise questions as to how I can afford to pay for it fully. I wanted to buy a car but it would also raise questions. So I had no choice. I had to admit to her the truth. She cried for two reasons. Firstly because I cheated her for so long.

#98315,17/5/2021,"So my girlfriend and I are fighting over this simple thing. I used to be very bocap/lazy in terms of dressing style and grooming in general which meant I got less dates. However, I saw a sharp increase in the number of dates I went after I put in effort to manage my appearance.I got into a relationship with this girl. I chose her because she is a kind and caring person. However, I did not like her dressing style compared to other girls I dated before. After a while, I started suggesting that she try wearing a but more shorter or revealing outfits to look a bit more sexy. I suggested that she wear regularly if possible and if not, at least a few days a week. She got angry and started saying it is her choice to wear whatever she wants. I do not disagree. I put in a lot of effort to look good so I felt that she could do something as well. I also did sacrifice and do  other things for her so I suggested that she could sacrifice a bit for me as well. I don't usually ask her for things by the way. She just downright refused to do it, not even to wear sexy outfits once a week. I talked to her and found out that she is not comfotable showing so much skin. I told her that maybe we can take it in small steps, maybe wear slightly shorter and slowly increase the shortness over time. Still she refused. Finally, I suggested that she wear sexy outfits when she is at my place or her place. She got furious at this point because I kept on trying so she refused to talk to me for a while.At this point, I got so pissed off. Guess what I did. I did not bring up about this outfit issue to her. I just went back to my bocap style of dressing, just a sligtly oversized t-shirt, shorts and a pair of slippers. I would wear this outfit no matter where we went, including those classy restaurants. She felt embarrassed at one of the place and asked me why I am wearing such as outfit. I refused to answer her question and just talk about something else. I do not want to fight around this. By the way, the bocap style is the most comfotable form of dressing.Now, I know all the girls want to rage at me but wait, I did not do anything wrong here. In fact, it is fair. Throughout this process, I did not force her. I only made suggestions to her. Despite making sacrifices for her, she did not try to make any forms of adjustments for me. It felt unfair to me. By the way, I do most of the work in the relationship, like planning dinners or outings, buying gifts, accompanying her, waiting for her after school, etc. Now, it is fair because like her, I don't need to put in effort in my dressing to try to impress my romantic partner. It should go both ways. I should be able to wear whatever I want, similarly to the fact that she can wear whatever she wants.Some of you may say that I do not deserve her but I feel that it goes both ways. Despite her not making adjustments for me, I still found a way to make it fair for us. If she still decides to break up with me for this, then I can't do anything.

We only became friends when we were going home together one day and realised we have similar interests. Initially, I was pretty awkward when it comes to having conversations with her. I don't have much female friends in the first place. Eventually, this friendship developed to the point where I was pretty talkative around her and we often hang out with mutual friends. This friendship remained strong even after graduation and we went to seperate universities. We also went on an overseas trip together. It was during this trip that I started to see her as more than a friend, but I wasn't sure if what I was feeling was fleeting . During the pandemic, she had some trouble with her studies and was diagnosed with depression. When she told me this, I tried my best to be supportive of her and her mental well-being. I really care for her and I still want to be with her.Here's the problem I'm facing. I'm a very introverted person, especially with women. I have no experience whatsoever with relationships. I have a low self-esteem and I don't see myself being someone who is good enough for her.

I have worked for a few years now and have notice the rise of such issuesIf this is your first job, I would suggest to start looking out first before resigning. Take a look at the job market and see if is moving well. If is slow, I suggest you hold on first. You are only a few months into your new job, so probably taking 2 weeks of leave is out of question, otherwise I would have suggest so, than to resign.Is easier to manage your own expectations than to manage others. If this is not your first job, I may have to be alittle direct here. Try to reevaluate your suitability for the role, or this career that you choose to be in. If the reason for leaving past jobs has been due to culture misfit, then perhaps gotta relook at your own strengths and see where they can play best at. Every company has its own set of problem and culture, you have to be adaptable to it. However let no one de-value you in any possible ways you can offer.  Talk to your partner about your BTO. That for sure can’t change. But financing it can. Talk to the professional to see how you can work around the finances over owning a house. It can be tough on one side, but is going to be temporary.

I wasn’t going to call off my marriage because i have a young daughter, and the matter seem too trivial to make my daughter a single- parent family child. I told him i’m liberal enough to understand sometimes when men go out together they need to go to such places to boost their ego, but warned him to keep his limits. He promised no such places again. 2 years now, he’s been good, responsible and very hardworking, we live a comfortable life. Recently, i chanced upon an old chat while searching his phone for some info (he knew i was using his watsapp to search). The chat read: A- i have headache.

So now, obviously, this old chat meant that HE WENT? Cos he is asking his friend to join them at massage? What shd i do now?? I have forgiven him then, shd i question him abt this now?

#98301,17/5/2021,"Dear post #98264 (on whether to quit new job), one year ago I wrote an anonymous post because I was facing the same dilemma as u (u may go read my post #89154). I was constantly stressed and worried, anxious and upset. I was also overworked and disenfranchised, asking myself why am I working so hard and what is my purpose in life. In summary, I felt that I was suffering from burnout, PTSD on a demanding job and it was affecting my self esteem, my productivity and ultimately the workplace suffers from my lackluster outlook.After reading the kind comments by the netizens, I start to reflect and ask myself what is the most important thing in my life. Sure I was drawing an above average pay, working in a stable large organization, but I wake up everyday like a zombie, start work at 8am, rush through all these deadlines sometimes without lunch and dinner, knock off at 3am, and the cycle repeats. One comment on my post that jumped out at me was whether the life I was living was sustainable, and there is no point in earning to pay my medical bills. When my workplace decided not to give us promotions and raises despite having the best performing year (my industry is countercyclical and does well when the wider economy is in recession), I told myself, that's it - I'm not there for the passion, my health was getting poor, work so hard and yet remuneration does not commiserate with the hours put in. So I left my job, I did things which I enjoyed, wake up everyday naturally, take long walks, attended courses which I always wanted to. It felt Abit odd when everyone else was hustling so hard in the prime of their age while I had zero income/only cash outflow but sometimes life works in miraculous ways - one day one of my ex-colleague contacted me to help him out on a part time basis, so I only had to devote few hours a day for work. Afterwards, because we had such great chemistry working together, I joined him on a full time basis. Looking back, I feel that sometimes we try too hard when life has its ways of opening another window for u when one door closes. Everyone is trying to find our own little way to survive, but don't let pressures of life get you down. Sometimes u know it in ur gut that something is not right, but we are so afraid of being the odd one out and doing things out of the norm. It's perfectly ok to stop and take a deep breath, rest, and start walking on a different path when u are ready - and don't let anyone or anything dictate the timing for when that happens. I believe at some point in our lives, we'll suffer from quarter-life/mid-life crisis. The good thing is we can all reach out to someone to talk about our issues, and I hope my own story can give u courage to take the course of action only u can decide.

#98275,17/5/2021,"To the OP of #98230Hopefully my story can allow you to reflect and understand the situation better.I have two children from a prior marriage. My ex-husband was a man child while we stayed with his parents. I’m the one who cares about striving to earn higher income and taking care of children needs while he quitted his job and became in and out of job over the years. He was not interested in trying to earn more money, more importantly not interested in self-improvement of any kind and taking care of the children unless being peristently asked to. When we divorced, one child followed my ex-husband while the other child followed me. A few years later, I met someone attractive (in a personality way): he likes to exercise, is family oriented and has a stable job. He accepted me, my child and my past, and we got married. After marriage, he changed gradually even as we have our third child: not interested in exercising and maintaining his weight (especially shortly after our wedding ceremony), less interested in interacting with our children and have little interest to ask for higher pay in his job or switch jobs to achieve higher pay. These changes are minimal (except his disinterest to maintain his weight haha), as he still takes care of our children but this is a fraction of the time he spends on the screen. Regarding finance, we had a joint account (I still have a separate personal account but he doesn’t) and he said I can invest the money in joint account if I want to, otherwise we will leave in bank account. Besides occasional squabbles, I have not regretted being with him. Now back to my ex-husband. Since divorce, he has not quitted his job and he becomes interested in personal finance and how to grow his money. He cares a lot now more on taking care of our tween child compared to the past which he left to his parents or me to take care. I’m happy to see that he has matured and my child is in better hands.Reading your story, I wonder if the state of being married can make men (and maybe also women) desire to stagnate instead of achieving in his career, life goals (to keep fit and attractive, for example). I feel that if one partner is taking responsibility for duties and roles in the family (e.g. earning income, tending to children), the other partner may not feel the need to put in some weight to achieve better outcomes.To OP, whether you divorce your husband is your personal decision. Yes some members of society will frown upon your decision, but you yourself should know best what is the best environment for your children. If you intend to go through a divorce route, make sure you have some caregiving support, for example family members or a reliable helper to help take care of your two children, and that the divorce is amicable.

#98271,17/5/2021,"Need some career advice. I graduated from NUS about a year ago. I was luckily enough to have secured a job despite the pandemic. However, the people in the company was extremely toxic and I quit my job within 6 months (it was a rotation program and i quit during the 1st rotation) as i was having alot of mental health problems (panic attack, anxiety ,probably depression due to the job) I then joined this multinational company which was actively hiring and got in. However, i now understand why they are always hiring: turnover is extremely high as the workload is very heavy. My supervisor is also an extremeeee micromanager (A very polite way to put it). During my regular check-ins with her, i mentioned how the workload might be heavy sometimes. And so she asked me to create a journal of some sort to take down how long i take to do each activity every day. In my next check-in with her, she asked me to list down and quantify how long i took to do each activity in the past week. Above all, she commented about how my hair was messy etc ( but mind you i am in an ops position with no needs of meeting any external customers) Just wanted to clarify, everyone i have spoke to in my team think that the workload is too heavy and we have high turnover rates (On average 1 year - 2 years.once, the fastest to leave would be in less than 4 weeks). Everyone wants to leave. When the team makes a small mistake in their work, we would have to start digging out pass records and my manager would press you hard to find out why did you make that particular error. Higher-ups are like that too and like to ask ‘if you screwed up’. This digging of past records served completely no purpose at all and it isnt any life and death situation. Digging up the past records was just to prove the point to then on how you “screwed up”. Not to mention, during covid Phase 2HA we still had to report back to office despite our work being fully capable of being done at home. I completely see no future with the team and cant wait to leave every single day. But with my current job record: 1st job being about 6 months and i am in my current job in only about 6 months too, would anyone hire me? Internal transfer within my current company might be difficult as we would have to declare to our managers once we get the interview (i dont understand too).

Generally, the student leaders do not feel appreciated and they are generally very unhappy.

#98252,17/5/2021,"Hi Prof Ben / friends, what would you do if you were in my situation?My mom works as an office assistant and she's not drawing much in gross monthly income. I started work about 2 years ago, and was lucky enough to find a job that paid me a decent starting pay (take home amount about S$4,500). I decided to give my mother a monthly allowance of about S$700 as I wanted her to live more comfortably. I felt that the amount was fair because I was staying with my parents and I ought to pay my fair share of household expenses.Over the last two years, I have also gifted my mother various things which she had wanted, each of which costs between S$400 to S$800 (such as a phone, a new vacuum, massage chair and exercise device).I performed quite well at work and my current take home amount is about S$6,000. I have not increased my mother's allowance (and have no intention of increasing the allowance) as I do not think my mother needs the extra cash. This has caused some tension between us.Earlier this year, I moved out of my house (and into a shared apartment) for my mental wellbeing due to regular quarrels at home (my stepfather is a narcissist and everyone in the family quarrelled with him frequently). I continued to give my mother the same monthly allowance (S$680) as I felt I could afford it financially and I did not want to disrupt her way of life too much. That said, my mother thought that I was being wasteful as the rental fees could have been given to her as additional allowance. I don't think she really needs the money for daily expenses - she recently spent about S$3,000 on some cosmetics products. My parents also have a good amount of savings (about S$600-700k in investments and no debt); together with my monthly allowance and her salary, the amount should be sufficient for my mother to live well enough. I recently shared my hopes and dreams for the next 2 years with my mother, which on hindsight was a mistake. I wanted to move to my own apartment once I get my big raise next year. This is important to me and is something which I have been looking forward to. She asked how much the rental would cost and I said about S$2,000. She responded that she would like to retire soon, and essentially insinuated that I was being wasteful with my money (e.g. I could have supported my family instead of spending the money in wasteful things like rental which I don't really need). She stopped talking to me after that and said, ""why have I raised a child like that?"" This was hurtful because someone I loved did not share the same excitement for my future.Additional background: My mother paid >S$100,000 for some overseas programme which I wanted to attend when I was younger, but she said several times over the years that I didn't have to repay her at all and I should pursue my dreams. On the one hand, I feel a little guilty because she spent so much money on me but I am unwilling to share part of my success with her. On the other hand, I feel like I am treated like a golden ticket to a good life.

During my time in NUS, I was shocked to learn that majority of my polytechnic classmates came from Temasek poly, even more so than those who came from Singapore poly and Ngee Ann poly combined. With the no. of students coming from Temasek Polytechnic being so out of proportion, I suppose NUS admits students based on face value of the applicant's poly GPA instead of their relative GPA. Unlike other polytechnics, there is no bell curve in Temasek poly. Thus, there is no limit to the number of students in Temasek poly who can be awarded A's and any average student can easily get 3.7-3.8 out of 4. In other polys such as Singapore poly where there is actually a bell curve, a 3.7 gpa would already be considered the top, in the 90th percentile at least. Perhaps NUS isn't familiar with how poly grading systems work but moving forward, I sincerely hope that the Admissions office could do a proper review i.e. only admit the top 15% of overall applicants from each polytechnic and obtain the statistics/median gpa of graduands from each polytechnic. If we continue to go by absolute gpa, it would be extremely unfair to students from other polytechnics.-#98238: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98238",7,3,0,0,3,12,0,0,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

#98233,17/5/2021,"22(F) here, my best friend of many years seem to be strung along by a guy. Initially when they got together, I was kinda sour because I lost a companion, but I was pretty supportive of her. They had fights, i even encouraged her to try longer, try harder because fights are a common thing.I went to find out some of his history and it is not very pretty.When I found about the things he did and in general the way he treats her, I just did not like him and tried warning my girl about him. She immediately pretty much hates me right now. they still had fights and she would be the one begging him to get back together. Like many of the previous posts, she is showing signs that she is just keeping quiet so the guy has no reason to fight with her.She has one condition if we are to be friends again, and that is to accept and be friends with that lousy guy of her's . Tried asking the reason why and working around that because it is damn obvious he isn't anything good and is just using her, and I would never want anything to do with him. She will not accept anything else and just ghosts me, someone who had been with her for years.What can I do about this if she is someone like my family, is there any way I could even accept that guy? Its not like I do not accept the fact that she is in a relationship, but its more like, why can't she just keep her bf out of our things and insists that her bf is to be invited or allowed around me . She would just shut me out and hate me more if I tried saying anything negative about the guy. And she will not listen to outsider opinion about how she is obviously being led around. that guy just hurts her and she will keep running back to him like she is blind.

#98230,17/5/2021,"My husband and I are in mid 30s. He’s a nus graduate but earning 4+k even though he’s promoted twice. He’s in his second job since graduation. He has no wish to apply for jobs even though he keeps saying he’s not earning high. We have two very young children and definitely need money and i do help him to apply jobs, update his resume but he’s really not wanting to change job. Before you say anything, I’m always trying to look out for opportunities (other than when I was pregnant) and thankfully I recently secure a job that can pay me higher. I am not ambitious because I’m still a lower level employee despite being a NUS graduate as well. Still individual contributor and earning $4+k as well even though I graduated >10 years already. Disappointing right? But I’m still on the lookout for even a better salary than my current one if I can, a job scope that I may like better than my current one. And yes… if I had opened my eyes bigger before marriage, I definitely will not marry him (because of some other issue). But now we have two kids and yes, I do bring up divorce every now and then which is very depressing because I know in relationships and marriage, breakups and divorces should not always be brought up. I’m embarrassed yet I cannot stop myself from thinking about divorcing. My income is not high but I can definitely support my two kids alone and I don’t need another child (my husband). I’m really annoyed he’s not standing up as a man to take care of our family - be it physically, emotionally or financially. I don’t need him to pay for my shopping and I definitely do not go for any luxury goods. He’s just hanging there waiting to pass time. Many times I told him why did he even get into a relationship when he doesn’t even want to take on responsibility of being a husband and a father. I’m his first gf but he’s not my first bf. He doesn’t invest, doesn’t look for the best interest rates for savings accounts to try to ‘earn more’. He doesn’t try to improve himself. He only likes to watch people playing game on YouTube and watch soccer highlights. He sleeps very little every night doing all these boliao things which really annoy me because it affects his health.To me, he should take care of his health and prioritise on things especially when he has me and two children. But he doesn’t care?!?!?! To think he’s the eldest of 4 in his family but still really useless in all aspects of taking care of people. I know I will get slammed here but I really wanna hear viewpoints from others. He has changed since we got married and moved into our house. Sad to say I didn’t notice the original him (the current him) because I would then know we are not right for each other. I’m not a money leecher and I definitely only want to have a better life with my family. No need extravagant. His expenses are really high because he bought insurance policies from his younger sister before he met me and he has to pay >1k/month. His sister is really irresponsible because she only did it during her uni days to earn from family members then she quit. Please help me. Wake up my idea? Stop being this kind of wife?-#98230: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98230",142,66,0,46,0,95,0,45,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#98229,17/5/2021,"Just need to vent my heart out. My internship supervisor seems to hate me now just because I can't get one assignment right, and I don't think my actions warrant such treatment.From my point of view, I don't think I am a poor performing intern. I contribute rather substantially to the code base under the task assigned. It is just that a particular tech stack is confusing, and suffers from conflicting information on the web, so I had a hard time understanding how the company worked with it without proper guidance.  For someone like who is completely unaware of the entire tech-stack, my supervisor's instructions were 'hint-ish' at best and cryptic at worst. Despite my best efforts to resolve the issue and actually get the code working, it somehow always result in her saying ""This is not the way we do things"", ""Why didn't you do this as instructed"", despite the fact that attempts to follow her lacklustre instructions never got the code to work at all. When I tried to clarify time and again, it seems at one point she was so fed up that she booted me off the assignment. I was polite all the way through, so it seems she was genuinely bothered at the fact that a fresh intern is automatically initiated with the specifications of the company management, which was never briefed to me in my tenure thus far.Next week, I will be reshuffled to another department in the company. I am afraid that news may spread that I am a stupid and incompetent intern, and it may affect my internship experience for the remaining 5 months.May I know if this is all because I really am a bad intern, I have an unreasonable boss, or I should have done things differently along the way.

#98221,17/5/2021,"I have a question about blind rage. I don't know whether that's the correct term for it but maybe those with pschology background or have good relationship related wisdom can correct me.I get that in relationships people get upset and fight for things. Usually these fights are to make a certain aspect of the relationship better and they can get quite passionate and heated. Not ideal but hey, at least it is all for a good cause.The reason I ask about blind rage is I think my girlfriend switches into a different mode when angry. She will change topic multiple times, not respond to anything I say, and just blindly say things, scream, insult me and say all sorts of untrue things. It is like her goal is to inflict maximum damage, pain and hurt to me. Mind you this is not just for 5 minutes, it can last 2 weeks sort. Funny thing is probably 30 minutes in, she already forgot what she was fighting about, she just wants to fight for the sake of fighting. It is like some sort of vengeance thing, definitely not constructive, and definitely not for any cause or change she is passionate about. That's what I call blind rage.Almost everything the catalyst for this blind rage or should I say almost all our fights, is her being angry that I am upset or hurt by something she said or did. My girlfriend constantly tells me things like she is a very kind person, she is a person of good character. I find that very weird, like who says this kind of things, it is like she wants to label herself that way desperately. So I think if I tell her she did or said something unkind to me, that sort of threatens her self identity if that makes sense? This then becomes a sort of reflexive defense mechanism for her? I am no psychologist but 3 years of observing this has more or less convinced me this is what is happening.Sad part is I still don't know how to deal with her blind rage. Maybe if anyone knows the correct terminology for it, the internet can give me some ideas if it is a well studied mental condition. Of course any advice to make the situation better is also always welcome.-#98221: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98221",10,3,0,2,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

#98212,17/5/2021,"In response to the 21 year old guy and his troubled fiancé in post #98186,I’ve had for some time, the desire to reflect and write about my past three years of experience in this love-hate relationship with architecture in NUS, so perhaps you can see this an opportunity to make a more informed decision with regards to the pursuing of this course. As you may have already read in the comments, there is the good, and of course the bad, that is associated to this discipline of study - which I will review to the best of my knowledge as a student currently undertaking the course at present.Let me just say that Architecture students are rather known to be the bunch of “no life students with no time” on the campus. Unless you have godly time management skills or incredible stamina to pull through the semester with little sleep, the typical Architecture student will not have much time to commit to sports or club activities. In certain electives with group work involved, there are actually students who shun grouping with architecture students not because they are “slackers who do not contribute”, but rather because they have “no time to contribute quality work”. Many people have little to no idea as to what we actually do in school, and depending on your circle of friends, you might actually be mocked at rather often. “Drawing only what”, “Make models ah, build tower I also can”, “Designing your next jenga ah” - I myself, frankly, was quite insulted by these little comments, made by close friends even, in the beginning. Over time you’ll learn how to laugh it off, but you’ll somehow still feel a little dissed for sure. I think the first thing I want to make clear is, yes, to be honest these chiding comments are not entirely wrong. But it’s also just the tip of the iceberg as to what we commit to, fret and stress about for the entirety of 13 weeks, for the 8 MC (which just means it counts as 2 normal modules) Design Studio Module.Our main core module, the 8 MC Design Studio, is the most important priority of any NUS Architecture student regardless of the semester. On paper, it only takes up one day of the timetable: from 9 -6pm, it’s the one day where you get to meet your tutor (which are mostly outsourced to practitioners) for feedbacks regarding your design. Conceptually however, it actually demands the entire week’s time for preparation and presentation. Because that one day is mainly for studio consultations, you don’t actually learn much unless you ask your tutors the right questions. And to know what to ask, that’s where you have to find time in the week to hit the books, research, and you might be surprised that it takes up quite a substantial amount of time before even the ideation phase, followed up by the production phase which is most well known by others as the “drawing” and “making models”. The importance of this core module is real, because it can only be taken once a year - if you fail it, you’ll have to wait an entire year to re-take it. And the importance of pulling through it will be drilled indirectly into you by the tutors starting from the first year. “Don’t spend so much time on your electives, they are not important”. “Your production this week is quite lagging behind others. Are you spending too much time on your CCA?”. “In Archi, the only important thing is studio”. It is not surprising that as a result, most architecture students (in my opinions) are always in search for that “easy-to-get-A elective” module, and those involving essay writings are especially loathed. Ironically, I feel this is one of the reasons why many a times, we feel so stressed when we have an idea block and end up “producing nonsense” sometimes. Innovation and creativity demanded by the curriculum, ironically, is many a times unearthed in the exploration of fields not even related to architecture at all.About the highly competitive environment…I think it’s something that varies according to what kind of batch mates you have, but it’s true. Frankly, I have even lost people whom I thought were close friends over grades. There were people who stopped talking to me after the grade for a certain group project turned out terrible, but I think this’s a niche extreme example. But when we talk about competitive, it’s a really toxic culture that not only exists between students, but even between tutors as well. Sometimes I feel that the friends you have in Archi are nice people to laugh and joke with during the holidays, but when the semester starts, they immediately become your fiercest rivals. Depending on the rigorous nature of the tutor’s studio, each week become a continuous cycle of outdoing one another in terms of graphical aesthetics, quantity of models or drawings produced…sometimes it’s really tiring and it makes me wonder what true learning really is, you know. If you are someone especially who suck at softwares and graphical production, you’re in for hell! And there’ll be tutors that will compare their studios’ work. “My studio’s site model is made of acrylic, your one…cardboard?” Even stuff like that you know. It’s a brewing toxic culture which makes one believe that the more you do, the better the architect you are becoming to be, and in turn the better your grades when it comes to the end of it all. And that brings me to my next point, the mental health of architecture students in NUS.Architecture school, regardless of whatever country you’re in, is known to be not only mentally but also physically tiring as well. Unlike other disciplines of study, it’s not like we have textbooks to refer to, you know. And because there’s no “fixed syllabus”, tutors don’t really teach - they only “teach” through answering what you are interested to find out about each week, so the mental rigor lies in the 100% self initiated and driven research which you have to do (ie hardcore google). This also applies to first year students - so for those who are coming in, you better know clearly what plans and sections are because the tutors here will not babysit you. As for the physical, assembling the model is just one half of it. The other half, is actually producing your work in time so that you can print out your drawings, or laser cut your model parts etc. Up the years, the things you have to print increases in size to A0 - A1s, and there are not really a lot of printing shops that specialises in this which are wallet friendly. And laser cutting takes time too depending on the quantity and quality, so you really have to juggle your time well and work backwards to factor in all this to make it in time for the studio consult day. If you have a unreasonable tutor who’s the kind that believe that “studio is the only module you are taking in NUS”, you’re in for pure hell. I’ve had one such tutor in my second year, and in my studio of 12 students, 4 ended up with depression by the seventh week, including myself. 2 went for UHC counselling, and 1 of them almost committed suicide. I think that was really a wake up call for myself at least, and it was bad to the point that I actually had to tell my tutor about it before he “suddenly became all nice and friendly” towards the end. Extremely disgusting. Substantial number of students drop out each semester too, I think about 6 took leaves of absence to take care of their mental health just this semester. But that aside, I think the mental health of NUS architecture students are swirling at rock bottom. In your first two years, you’ll be that fool that will be like, “How many all-nighters you pulled for this?”, “I stayed up again to do this drawing”. Come the third year, suddenly the fatigue of sleep deprivation just starts to sink in and there come a point of time you realize how sluggish you’ve become. The work only increases in difficulty and demands up the years, so let me just be frank and say there will be no escape from the occasional sleeping late and all nighters, though lesser if you have good time management. In response to the depression situation in year 2, an established tutor actually came to speak with our studio and spent half the time bragging about how her achievements were attributed to good time management and how she have never pulled an all nighter. Seriously, bitch please, which era did you study in? Back in your days, softwares wasn’t that developed, and so was design. Times have changed at the present, and anyone with your mindset is headed for sure doom and a repeat semester. Even the poly students, which are known to be the “Gods” for their skillsets, are visibly struggling. Sometimes, I wish the department would stop spewing such bullshit and be more real and less delusional about the mental health of their students. It’s so easy to say stuff like “get more sleep” and brush it off, but you know that isn't the case. In this aspect, I wish the department would really be more serious about it if they truly care. We're not just workhorses for the ever-going supplementing of jaw-dropping graphics for your instagram feed you know. We're humans too. So, treat us like one instead of iterating things like how ""it's not gonna be any better in the working world"".At this stage, I would like to say that architecture is not 100% just about bad stuff like the toxic slit throat culture, poor physical and mental health, and the non existent social work life balance. Because if it really was, no one with a rational train of thought would be taking it. As much as I hate these aspects of architecture in NUS, there are things which still fascinates me and sustain my passion, though reduced to embers over the years. I hate to say that your experience in NUS architecture will really be dependent on which tutor you get, but that is the truth that many of my friends can surely agree with. A terrible tutor will stress the hell out of you unreasonably or be too dumb to help you, but a good tutor will really inspire you and show you the world. Regardless, I felt that Architecture have really made me open my eyes and see the world, quite literally, in a new lens. Through your research, there will be times you have to dig into history, and that’s really one of the most amazing things you can empower yourself with in a world that’s ever-changing. It will make you want to travel to new places, and also the old places you’ve been to once again, to see the things with the new gained thoughts and perspectives gained in academia. And I think one of the best things about architecture, is that you’ll come to know a little bit of every field of study - like psychology, medicine, law, engineering, or even seemingly unrelated stuff like astrology or life science even - because these are the things that give you the ideas to be creative and break new grounds. The weekly consults will also imbue in you presentation and pitching skills, as well as the pre-mentioned time management skills to ensure all goes smoothly. Most importantly, I think Design Thinking in itself is one of the greatest takeaways you can ever receive. You’ll build up the courage to explore and repeat in pursue of success, and be hardened and open to even the harshest criticisms. These are soft skills which will accompany you far in life, even if you choose to leave the profession in the end. At the end of it all, I cannot guarantee that you will be that one shining starchitect ( a term used for world famous architects), but I can assure you that you will become courageous and easily adaptable to whatever the world out there throws out to you. Nonetheless, this is the pot of gold that lies at the end, though your path won’t be that of a rainbow but will instead be one cracking with flaming coals. Ultimately, it’s really about discovering what’s your calling ( so cliche, urgh!), and for those who already know, to challenge yourself to how far you can go. If you are in doubt, I think the worst thing that you can do is to not even try. A lifetime of looking back and “What if?” is truly sorrowful and real shameful, I think. To pull through it all requires strong conviction, but to leave it halfway is also by no means shameful nor disgraceful at all. My answer to those who are unsure - just jump in! Even if it’s not for you and eventually “waste one semester or two”, it’s not going to matter in the long scheme of things when you think about how long you actually have ahead of you. At the end of the day, it’s what you’ve learnt that really matters and not so much about the rat race. I actually intend to flame the curriculum more, but I think proceeding further would scare off all the architects-wanna-be, so I think I’ll hold back for now. Maybe, in another post. All in all, I hope the “real-ness” in this post is of benefit to whoever who is intending to pursue architecture in NUS, and at the same time, a ray of hope for a more enjoyable learning experience for my fellow friends struggling in this challenging course.

#98211,17/5/2021,"TL;DR - Daughter who can't stand living with mom anymore, just need to rantMy parents got divorced when I was 13, and it had a really bad impact on me, mentally and emotionally if it makes sense. I wouldn't say that I suffer from anxiety/depression etc. because I was never diagnosed and I don't wish to downplay the shit that people who do suffer from them go through. However, the emotional turmoil I was put through, did cause a lot of self-harm to happen, a lot of insecurities, a lot of just me trying to find a new identity and adapt to a new life without a happy family. A lot of these thoughts still surface even now.  My closest friends would have heard me talking about that one scene that replays in my head every now and then, of my father (one who never ever cries) choking up while wrapping my textbooks for me, while my mother packed her things in the room to move out. My dad loved and still loves my mom, the way he looked at her even now when we do meet, the way he always reminded me to listen and help my mom out because I'm the eldest. He loves her so much, but she left him because she didn't want to be with a ""poor"" man. Because I know how much my dad loves her and how much he would sacrifice his entire life just for her, that's why I hated my mom when she divorced my dad. We then moved out together, my mom got our custody and my dad didn't fight it because he didn't want my mom to go through so much. The relationship my mom and I had was horrible, I wouldn't talk to her, and I hated the sight of her. To me, she's a hypocrite who's nice only when people are around, she's nice to her friends and their kids, but doesn't treat us like humans when we're home. She does provide a roof over our heads, feeds us occasionally, but is she really a good mom if half the time she's losing her temper at us for things that were not our fault? Is she really a good mom if she hurls vulgarities at you when you were only 14, just because you didn't pack your school bag the night before? Is she a good mom if she calls you names and says ""I wanna kill you with a cleaver""? I lived with her horrible temper for close to 10 years. Even when things got better between us when I graduated from University, I would still stay out till 11 pm just to avoid having to speak to her or see her. The problem is, we share the same room and bed, so I have no choice but to face her everyday. I don't even have any sort of privacy or time alone in my room because we share a room AND BED?! uGH. For many years, I've yearned to move out on my own because dealing with her was so taxing on my mental health. I've tried taking my life a few times but failed because I always thought of my dad right before I take any action. Now that there's COVID, I've had to face her every single day at home because both of us work from home.. I am reaching my limit and I don't know how long I can deal with this. I wanna move out but rent is so expensive, but if I don't, I have to deal with her temper, insults, and ridiculous antics like buying appliances worth $5000 when she has no money and then borrowing money from us. If only there was a way to get rich quick, if only a kind soul would rent her room out to me for $100 or less, if only I was never born.. What would you do if you were me? with a measly 2.8k pay, a future to save for, and expenses to pay for? Anybody wanna take in someone who's about to lose her mind?-#98211: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98211",10,1,0,14,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
#98209,17/5/2021,"I first noticed you when we shared a lift heading to the first floor of our HDB flat. And just so happens that we were both headed to the MRT station, presumably to take the train to work.Since then I started looking out for you either during the morning walk to the MRT station or if we happened to be on the same MRT home in the evening, then sort of walk home together although it was a mostly one-sided experience. Although we're both constantly masked up, I can imagine how you look like underneath the mask. Your luminescent eyes your neat ponytail, your prim office clothing, your Michael Kors work bag. I notice them every time I see you. You probably never noticed me, just a regular guy in specs and office wear.Finally after weeks of occasional encounters, I decided that if I ever chanced upon you on the way home, I'll try to talk to you in the lift on the way up - elevator conversation?One fine day, that chance finally arrived. I noticed you in the neighbouring carriage of the MRT in the evening, and I thought, ""Yes, this will be my day."" Usually, I would keep my distance slightly behind you for the entire walk home, and never entering the same lift as you. But today was different. For the final stretch I paced myself a little faster to ensure that I'd be in the same lift as you. As we waited for the lift to come to the first floor, I practised mentally what line I'll open with..

#98204,17/5/2021,"Okay you all low sex-drive people. There's a term for people like us. Asexuals, or something close to the spectrum, demisexuals. There's nothing wrong with you, you're not broken. Sex won't fix you because you're not broken in the first place.Best way to explain things:Heterosexual: door swings one wayHomosexual: the door swings the other wayBisexual: door swings both ways Pansexual: it’s a revolving door Demisexual: the door is locked and only one person has the key Asexual: the door is actually a wall, has nothing to do with whatever direction it swings in.Basically kissing a person is no different than kissing a wall. If you prefer to have cake than to kiss or have relations with someone you love, you're probably asexual.There seems to be a lot of us who are just not sure what we are, just ""low sex-drive"".

We went through a lot together to get to where we are. Some friends behind us keep saying we won't last long. My husband has this best friend who is really pretty and close and I always feel very uncomfortable because when we were dating, they can meet 2 to 3 times a week and they will flirt, go clubbing alone and he does everything she says. She even insist of sitting beside my husband during our wedding. My husband always quarrel with me because of her and said that they are only friends. But they drifted off because of me and I always felt I was the one breaking them up. Recently, I found out that my husband contacted her back behind my back. My husband lied and went out with her a few times and even have a secret chat that I don't know of. They even booked a hotel together for staycation. My husband finally admitted he have feelings and lust for her all these years. My husband say he will breakup with her and asked for my forgiveness. What should I do? He seems really sincere.

I'm excited about AI, I like the program and I think it will empower me at many levels.I have two main concerns:1) I'm particularly worried about two modules which are CS5446 and CS5340 (AI Planning & Decision Making and Uncertainty Modelling in AI). I have no problem with coding and my worry is only about math.2) I understand that the program is rigorous but I want also to have a social life to a certain degree. I tried to look for students' experience about the program but couldn't find much. I can't also find any reference about the materials used in the modules or what type of skills are needed for each module.

#98198,17/5/2021,"Thoughts on my situationI am a y4 students who is graduating soon, but an incident has left a bitter taste in my uni life, and with my educational journey coming to an end, I felt a need to highlight this just to get some opinions to get some closure and perhaps shed some light on how NUS handles unforeseen events.I applied for exchange to a particular university, which was cancelled (before covid) due to certain external and unforeseen events. For some reason, I was only informed of the cancellation very late (one week into the semester). Modreg was already in round 3 or completely over and i was left to choose only from modules that had vacancies left. A NUS staff was supposed to help with securing of modules, but nothing could be done to add a vacancy for any module I had planned to take. To put it simply, I could not study the specialization I was interested in anymore due to this. In addition, the profs in the modules I took did not upload any webcasts and when I approached them during to ask for any material or recording, they simply asked me to get help from a friend and…all my friends were taking other modules. With the very late start to the semester which was extremely stressful, the lack of help from the teaching staff made it worse. I was struggling a lot and ended up doing worse than normal. I could not su the mods I did badly for and it ended up affecting my cap pretty badly. I was in contact with school staff during the semester and tried many times to ask for some sort of help or leniency in the form of getting the modules I intended to study or in the form of SUs, but all my requests were met with one final reply that “my academic excellence is my own responsibility”. My emails were ignored from then on.The fact that the entire NUS cohort had 10MCs during the first covid sem always made me wonder why I was given zero help in my situation. I’ve already graduated and all, so I’m not asking for pity or for my grades to be changed. I just wanna hear opinions from different people. Should NUS have intervened and done something about it, or should I have just sucked it up from the beginning?

#98187,17/5/2021,"I am feeling very hurt by my girlfriend's actions. Wanted an objective third party opinion on whether it is valid for me to feel this way or not?My girlfriend and I currently live overseas due to uni. She is very well traveled and has already been to 70 countries which is a lot for early twenties. I have only been to 6 countries. First times are very important to me and I feel that going to somewhere for the first time is very different from repeating. Of course, a third time can be a lot better than a first time as the company is ultimately more important. But with the same company, the first time together to that place, will almost definitely be better. She knows this is how I feel. I am also aware of her extensive travel history when we first got together two years ago and mentioned I hope she can leave interesting new places for us to experience together for the first time.A bit over a year ago, she travelled somewhere overseas brand new with a friend, fully well knowing that I wanted to go there with her. I wasn't very happy but did not say much. This confession here is also not about that trip, this info is just for context. I expressed my views again but she snapped at me, so I let it rest. Recently, I mentioned a place I wanted to go with her which was not far from where we live. She agreed. Earlier today she told me she has just booked a day road trip with friends there. I was very hurt, it was the exact place I wanted to go together with her. Her only response was 1) get over it 2) don't waste my time on silly things 3) there are 2 beaches in that region how can i save all for you when you did not even mention which specific beach when you mentioned that place 4) I can't go the other beach because my friend already going there another time so she wants to go to this one 5) we booked and the tickets are non refundable.Her response only made me feel even worse and even more invisible. Firstly to me, it was not so hard to just ask me which beach given I mentioned this region to her even before they planned this road trip, it takes a few seconds to ask me. Secondly the other beach is a shithole. Thirdly the tickets for the train ride isn't even that expensive, like 30 dollars with student discount, and my girlfriend is the sort who will drop 2000 dollars on a handbag. Fourthly, there are really not many places we can go to near us which are nice, and this is one of very few options we can go to brand new together. Fiftly, she just blew me off again when I expressed these to her, telling me I am the one being hurtful because I am not supportive of her, flipping the tables onto me. She even started insulting me and hurting me further.To me, half the reason I am upset is the incident above. I felt she was very inconsiderate and did not care at all about how I feel. It's almost like she prioritizes her friends over me. Also she told me I am not invited. The other half of the reason I am upset is the way she responded when I told her I was hurt by her actions. Instead of hearing me, instead of suggesting any solutions, she chose to ignore every single point or query I had, and chose instead to attack me, and hurt me further. She chose to start a fight instead of caring. To me, this bodes very badly for the future of this relationship.Am I over-reacting? What would you have done in my shoes? What solutions do you think might work going forward in this case?-#98187: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98187",72,8,0,11,0,21,0,20,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

He was soon making advances towards my fiancé's friend despite being attached. He took a semester off after his girlfriend found out.She does not want me to end up this way.

#98179,17/5/2021,"Hey all, need your objective critique on a semi-life decision. What would YOU do in my situationSummary of events chronological order:I was a broke and angsty 16 yo girl with no parents - no financial help, had to rent rooms all the while maintaining a FT job on weekdays and PT jobs on weekends. Admitted into NUS, with highest tier of financial help because the school understood my situation. Repressed and ignored my feelings of envious, jealousy when girls or boys my age had warm families to return to even if they didn’t have wealth. I had neither of each. Entered world of sugardaddies but never had sex until recently (3 years later)Trauma and abuse from an SD/ bf which helped me as much as he harmed me. Accumulated decent wealth and CPF and employment prospects currently. Although I was admitted to the doctors a couple times for being overworked. Until today, I ignore the scars left on me, I was abandoned, defiled and raped but no one can tell my situation from the outside. I “look” rich, well-travelled and happy with family and friends.So, recently I got a marriage proposal from someone I know for a long time (he is a good man, with strong morals and ethics). His and my goals are aligned in starting a family and building a home together. He is a multi-millionaire too which he mentioned he can solve my problems if required. But the problem is, based on the trauma and experiences I have - I don’t want to give up my independence or “hustling” mentality to settle for someone who might disappoint me in the future. I’d be trading my youth, time and energy for security and money (which I need). I am only 22 btw. What would you do? Continue to sugar/ work/ date others or settle for someone who can give you the security you require in 10 years but miss out on the “fun” that you should experience in your early twenties.-#98179: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98179",36,2,0,0,9,23,0,0,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Do not go the other way around (mothers tend to) and make yourself bitter and everyone bears the brunt. This 60-40 rule can be applied even for 2 mins. Imagine your kids are making a huge mess and the laundry is piling etc. Ask yourself how can I satisfy myself using the 60-40 rule in this very minute. Practice and slowly expand it into larger time chunks. For instance June holidays. How can I plan my schedule, work full time, do housework and care for the children all at the same time using the 60-40 rule? One way would be to offload some chores to your husband. If your husband refuse to help, ask him to hire a helper. If he refuses to help and refuses to help pay for the helper then either pay for the helper yourself or maybe learn to live with a messier house. Do things your way to the best of the situation.2) when 1) does not work. You try to make the best of the situation and still you can't get over it. I am a Buddhist. Buddhist teach karma. My mum says hurtful things. I used to get upset but not anymore. I tell myself that I owe her some karmic debt and must pay back this life. So I suck it up.Be careful not to over include problems as karma. How do you determine karma? Simple. A persistent problem is a sign of karma. E. G. Difficult relationships, problematic character flaw, constant financial woes.Whether karma exist or not is not the question here. These 2 ways are merely methods to help you become at peace.What's the benefit or making a scene? The one who caused the scene is always the one left worst off.. Yes not worse off but worst off. Bcus that person will feel worse off than before and carry the shame of causing a scene.-#98133: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98133",0,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've experienced phases of very fluctuating sex drive throughout my dating life and at times questioned the same as you. I've come to realize sometimes it has less to do with the physical performance and more with the psychological triggers you felt in the relationship. Also, our female hormones seem to play roulette on our lives quite often too. An experienced partner may know how to trigger and turn you on. But I would say it is good to explore yourself too, so your pleasure is not so dependent on others and will not seem like a hit and miss game. Guys are very good at this and they learned since early what they enjoy, hence they seem to have more stable sex drive. While we usually don't self-explore enough and hence rely more on the external factors to determine our sex drive instead of triggering it ourselves. About myself: since my last breakup I went through a ""dry"" period with low sex drive, then I got curious and started to experiment more with myself and I would say I'm more sexually active than ever, with or without a partner  Good luck.-#98126: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98126",2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

His bestfriend is his first love.. Whenever he gamble and lose money, he would blame it on me when I didn’t do anything wrong and we would argue all day long. Who wouldn’t stand up for themself for something they didn’t do?Honestly, I am not the perfect girl out there, i’m just a 5/10 based on looks and personality wise I still have a million things to work on. Throughout the entire rs with him, I have learnt so much about my flaws and especially: - I had a terrible abusive childhood and I cannot control my temper and would get really mad and all and whenever I got shouted at, I couldn’t help it but hurt myself and I know that I am really hard to handle at the start, but now I changed it. - I cry really easily and up to the point whereby he gave up and whenever I cry he would just ask me why do you cry so easily, what are you doing or just leave me alone to cry but I can’t blame him for not understanding that i’m emotional. I would get unhappy with the fact that he wouldn’t come over to me when I’m crying but he would say that when he is angry he won’t do that I have to accept that he is like that and I’m expecting too much.Honestly, the arguments are so minor that I felt that as we both grow older we can mature up together. He was the first guy I imagined a future with. There was more good than bad  but however, the reason why we broke up was because even when we were in a rs, he secretly flirt with girls behind my back on instagram and download dating apps as well.

#98122,17/5/2021,"In response to the slut-shaming to post #97886 There are too many individuals who seem to think that they are entitled to name-calling without understanding a person’s story as well as the motivations behind their actions, as such I hope that perhaps reading this allows one to reconsider the very nature of judgement itself. Now, moving on to what the OP did: I think it would be fair to acknowledge that she has not only battled the feelings of lust but also tried to find an outlet on NUSWhispers to seek advice/rant and not once has she mentioned that she has committed the actual act of cheating on her current partner. Allow me to explain why her feelings of lust are not logically wrong. Dawn Maslar, a biologist professor mentions on her TED talk that the science of attraction is one that is based upon a chemical reaction. Lust is a feeling that is caused by both Testosterone and Estrogen in female and male bodies. Testosterone, while commonly mistaken for being a ‘male-only’ hormone, can be found in both female and male bodies and increases the sex drive in almost anyone upon the trigger of their 5 senses. As such, on the premise of science, can anyone still really blame one for having these feelings of lust? In fact, the moral penal code itself highlights varying levels of mens rea (intentions when committing the crime), and given that the thoughts of lust were purely in the OP’s head and actions were not taken, in the eyes of the law the OP is a free woman. Especially in accordance with the theory of concurrence, as the OP’s feelings of shame had prevented her from committing the actual physical act of cheating (actus rea), the OP’s act of abstaining from the physical act of cheating itself should be highly commendable.  Note that the OP mentioned in her very last line that she detests her thoughts of cheating. This indicates an acknowledgement on the OP’s part on the lack of morality of cheating itself. She knows cheating is wrong, and she even hates herself for thinking it. This is indicative of the moral state of the accused OP – she not only understood that her thoughts were wrong but she also had the self-restraint to withhold from committing the actual act of cheating. As such, how is it fair to condemn her for being a slut? While thinking of cheating itself might be a mental crime, it is perhaps a flaw in the law that mental crimes are perhaps the most difficult to convict. But honestly how many Jean Greys do we need to have in society to whistleblow? This then brings us to the moral question that extends from the very premise of what a ‘mental crime’ is. In fact, even masturbation itself could be considered as a mental crime, given that it requires some form of sexual stimulation (i.e mental, physical or emotional etc.) and coupled with the act of ‘mentally’ having intercourse or engaging in a sexual act with the person or persons of choice of whom one might not necessarily be in a relationship with. Consequently, is masturbation within the boundaries of a relationship wrong? Also if and when the individual engages in the act of masturbation towards a person of desire of whom he/her is not in a relationship with is it then wrong? A convenient paraphrase to this question might be - is it wrong to watch my favourite pornstar and get off? This is very much a question to be answered by both parties within the relationship. Some might find it alright, others might then deem it as a mental crime that is unforgivable. But the hard truth is that we are all humans powered by the basic instinct to procreate and are attracted by attractive things. If we are going to get real here and start dissing individuals for the numerous ‘mental crimes’ committed in their heads instead of taking constructive steps towards encouraging an individual who is already facing extant conflicting feelings of lust - there ought to be more shade being thrown upon these people who simply perceive situations at face value and decide to slut shame and name call. In fact, to take things into perspective, since lust is a mere feeling not only substantiated by science but also unable to be charged for in the eyes of the law, how is it that we as human beings somehow feel licensed to judge others for how they feel? Moreover, in accordance with this line of reasoning of it being alright to judge emotions, it is then fair to judge someone for feeling happy? Feeling sad? and the list goes on. The world itself is a dark enough place that operates on more than fifty shades of lust. Take for instance: The Bill Cliton affair with his young intern, the curious open marriage of Warren Buffett and the undeniable fact that Bill Gates kept his ex Ann Winblad close to him despite being married.In that light, there are numerous issues that toe the line when it comes to moral justice. But as a patron on NUSWhispers, it would be nice to have a baseline of moral decency and basic social grace to not appear like an ignorant name-calling fool before delving into the motivations behind an individual’s actions. Moreover, many might not understand that the power of name-calling is one that seems to condemn the one being named, but truly damns the namer. While there is an arguably a sick satisfaction in anger venting or whatever negative emotion being released in the process of calling someone a slut, the person who has been called a slut (the one being named) is not the only person being judged in the process. As the person calling ‘slut’ (the namer), might possibly be viewed by others as an aggressor and one who has an energy that is hardly positive as the general consensus of people who choose to name call are often that of persons who fail to examine beyond the surface.But if and when anyone would like to name-call, it would then be appropriate for one to be sure of the exact consequences of name-calling itself - not just to the one being name-called but also to the namer.-#98122: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98122",2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It has been more than a week since we last confirmed the plan and today my in-laws demanded that me and my husband go over to their place on the same day and cancel my plans. This is not the first time I had to cancel the plans that I have made with my friends just to attend their family dinner. Throughout our relationship I have never once been absent for any family gathering. I have drifted apart from some friends over the years due to differences in schedules and I also had to always cancel on them because of my in-laws' demanding behaviors. Tbh I feel bad about it.Last month I just had a talk with my husband regarding this when he asked why I haven't been meeting up with my friends. I was really disappointed that he didn't side with me this time. When any of their family members are not free, it's fine and they can just either postpone the date or go ahead without that person. But when it comes to me, nobody ever bothers to ask if I already had plans and demands me to prioritize them again and again. My in-laws are traditional people and they always emphasize that married women should prioritize her husband and in-laws. There was once when I was late for a dinner due to work and my in-laws sarcastically asked 'you're very busy hor?' But whenever they are late or suddenly cancel the dinner the day before when they have already made me cancel my plans, nobody bats an eye.

#98103,17/5/2021,"I have a question about blind rage. I don't know whether that's the correct term for it but maybe those with pschology background or have good relationship related wisdom can correct me.I get that in relationships people get upset and fight for things. Usually these fights are to make a certain aspect of the relationship better and they can get quite passionate and heated. Not ideal but hey, at least it is all for a good cause.The reason I ask about blind rage is I think my girlfriend switches into a different mode when angry. She will change topic multiple times, not respond to anything I say, and just blindly say things, scream, insult me and say all sorts of untrue things. It is like her goal is to inflict maximum damage, pain and hurt to me. Mind you this is not just for 5 minutes, it can last 2 weeks sort. Funny thing is probably 30 minutes in, she already forgot what she was fighting about, she just wants to fight for the sake of fighting. It is like some sort of vengeance thing, definitely not constructive, and definitely not for any cause or change she is passionate about. That's what I call blind rage.Almost everything the catalyst for this blind rage or should I say almost all our fights, is her being angry that I am upset or hurt by something she said or did. My girlfriend constantly tells me things like she is a very kind person, she is a person of good character. I find that very weird, like who says this kind of things, it is like she wants to label herself that way desperately. So I think if I tell her she did or said something unkind to me, that sort of threatens her self identity if that makes sense? This then becomes a sort of reflexive defense mechanism for her? I am no psychologist but 3 years of observing this has more or less convinced me this is what is happening.Sad part is I still don't know how to deal with her blind rage. Maybe if anyone knows the correct terminology for it, the internet can give me some ideas if it is a well studied mental condition. Of course any advice to make the situation better is also always welcome.-#98103: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98103",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

#98101,17/5/2021,"I started to date recently after being single for awhile. I am surprised how tolling a relationship could actually feel. I do like my bf that's why i decided to take the step and get into a relationship with him, however I feel like there's a difference in synergy.On his end, he really hopes that we can meet up as many times as we can, and spend more time together, which personally I do find that there's nothing wrong, since I also find that it's supposed to be normal to want to see/spend time with your S.O. On my end, I think it is also fine even if we don't meet up each other very often - we are both working adults and sometimes it is a little difficult to cater to the timing since my work ends slightly later than usual; but if we do make the plans to meet, I will definitely set aside my time to do so. In addition, as I do still have my other priorities (example family/religion) which I will place before our relationship, if the meetups were to fall on those dates, I made sure to suggest and commit for a different day if possible. This had also been communicated to him before, but overall i still get an inkling where he feels disregarded because of that (though he never explicitly mentioned), and I get afraid that he will misunderstand that I do not put in the effort to make the relationship work. And also on the other hand, I also feel tired pushing myself to go out on dates for long hours every week. But what can I do, I also want to make it work between us, so I still got to put in the effort on my end.We text daily as couples usually do, but sometimes I get uncomfortable when his text seems to insinuate sexual advances. He will mention about he misses me and can't wait to hug me/do ""naughty things"" etc. To set the record, I am okay with spending some physical time when we are together face to face, but I don't like to read about it in text, and I don't know how to respond to that. So when I read that, I just feel turned off and my replies subsequently will get very 敷衍 (""Perfunctory""), like ""Oh. Okay haha"". Which then again I will get worried that he thinks I'm not putting in the effort. I could see from his standpoint why he would send that to me, his love language is physical touch, and this form of writing is also his way of expressing that he loves and cares about me, but I feel uncomfortable about that way of expression... To me, just a ""I miss you, baby"" is sweet enough, and anything after that can be omitted to when we meet face to face. Otherwise I just feel like an object of sexual gratification lol. I am slightly hesitant to tell him about it because there was once where I offered my POV for a certain action via text, he did not took it very well immediately and felt like that was a form of rejection, of course after a night of rest, we managed to sort it out in the day. But it makes me feel like I will need to be very tactful in expressing my views on the issue, without making it sound like a rejection. So I had yet to tell him about this yet, still formulating a reply to either talk about this the next time he text me something similar, or to save it till we meet face to face.Really not sure if I'm thinking too much into this.-#98101: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98101",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
#98095,17/5/2021,"As a graduate of NUS who has entered into the workforce several years ago, I must say I am highly disappointed with the quality of interns that I am getting from one of our fellow local universities. While a student in NUS, I often felt there was comparisons drawn between ourselves and students from this said university - let’s call it University X. We were told, as students, that graduates of University X were arguably more charismatic, “hungry” for progression, had more quality presentation skills and overall better EQ. It was often the “coffeeshop” banter that NUS students, while strong in their academic quotient, may lack in EQ compared to their peers of University X. Now, I have had a string of interns from University X who have been assigned to our team, and I must say the experience has been exhausting at the very least.Out of many other observations, my biggest call out is the lack of respect and formalities - I’m all for a flat hierarchy, but that does not mean I place no importance on the value of respect to others. I think interns from this University seem to lack an understanding as to who is their “friend” and who is their “supervisior”. Call it what you will, but a flat hierarchy is more of a way of working - it does not negate the idea that we have an actual organisation structure in place with reporting lines. Simply put, they do not know when to put forward a professional front, and when to be appropriately casual. It is just a bit absurd to expect us at our mid management level to train someone who is an adult, in their 20s, on the basics of professional behaviour. Calling me your “pal” or “bud” when I’m your boss, sadly, does not fly. I’m not impressed by the “smoke and mirrors” of this said charming demeanour, when I feel it is a way to mask an obvious ineptitude in work quality. I have had interns from NUS, foreign universities and private universities who have never tried to skirt around this professional border, and always remained humble for learning and understanding.Disclaimer, this are views of my own experiences and I obviously know that not all students of this university behave this way. But I am just very upset that we NUS students were constantly belittled and compared to these peers of ours, when I have unfortunately yet to be impressed or proven wrong in my own experiences.My takeaway - give NUS students the recognition they deserve, and put a halt to this unnecessary comparison between us and those from University X.-#98095: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98095",12,5,0,0,13,45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#98092,17/5/2021,"Tl;dr Born in a well-to-do family left me with an crooked view of money.My parents are business owners and they’re relatively well to do. They taught me to be humble and kept telling me “We’re really not rich.” since I was young and that’s how I acted during Sec and JC. I have been a good student, admitted to a high demand course in NUS, everything went smooth. People often say we can get a “prestigious high-flyer” job after I graduate. However, half way through my course, I realised the so called “prestigious jobs” did not offer as much as I thought. Put it this way, my parents claimed “We’re just normal middle class, by no means rich.” That puts an investment banking or FAANG salary+bonus+stocks at “poverty” level, at least for the first 15-20 years, unless you become an MD in the US. Even the career end-point salary (when reaching 40-50) is not as much as what I am used to.  My parents are proud that they achieved everything without my grandparents’ help, though my grandparents are pretty successful too. They expected me to be independent after graduation, which I had nothing against. I felt anxious and started to run my own business, from investors to investors. The precious takeaway from my parents was that I learnt how business owners think and how to avoid being cheated or scammed when doing things. This was the first time also, that I stopped caring about my grades. It is quite ironic that person who doesn’t need money is now worrying about $$$ the most, while my friends are enjoying their life in University. Some simply concluded my little success to “Of course parents money lah”. But that didn’t affect me and I had too little time to care.

#98087,17/5/2021,"Is it normal or unacceptable to raise one's voice when one is frustrated or very upset at one's partner?My gf has a fiery temper which is very easily triggered. Once triggered, she can be vindictive, can lie, can be verbally and emotionally abusive, and can be very unreasonable, cruel and hurtful, a 180 degree change from the happy cheerful person she often is. I on the other hand am more of the patient and calm type. I hate anger and I hate conflict.What usually happens is once my gf is triggered, she will spew insults and vulgarities at me. I will often try to be nice and patient and try to calm her down and reassure her or whatever it takes. Even as she insults me, I won't retaliate. However if she keeps at this for say twenty minutes non-stop, inevitably I will get fed up and raise my voice and ask her to please stop. Unfortunately this just triggers her even more and she will say ""I deserve better than to be shouted at"" and then up her attacks on me. Later on she will lie and claim that the only reason she attack me is because I raised my voice at her, ignoring the abuse she was giving me until I cannot stand it. She also conveniently ignores the fact that the only thing I shout at her is begging her to stop, while she can spend three whole hours hurling expletives and false accusations at me, just to rant.How to deal with an unreasonable gf like that?-#98087: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98087",49,3,0,9,7,12,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
#98086,17/5/2021,"Is it normal to kinda lose your sex drive after breaking up? I'm asking because it's really been a long time and it doesn't seem like things are getting better or changing.So for background I'm 23F and graduating soon. I've had a couple of relationships, and I'm currently seeing someone but not really dating yet?Anyway the issue began after I broke up with my first boyfriend. Generally I felt that during that time my sex drive was kinda normal, maybe a bit lower than my bf at the time but nothing weird. Maybe once or twice a month kinda thing was comfortable?My next relationship was this Chinese guy fling I met on tinder before I got into uni, he was in NS and a couple years older than me and this is where I found my sex drive went way up to like almost regular weekly sessions or sometimes more when he could get over (he stayed out). He'd come over or we'd go over to some hotel just to have sex and I felt like I was almost always horny with him. He was I'd say very above average in bedroom-relevant size and I mean even though it was somewhat too large I still enjoyed myself in bed with him most times.After breaking up with him I seem to have lost almost all interest in sex, to the point where my last boyfriend complained that I was a tease and never in the mood. I kinda understand his point of view since I was really rarely in the mood and I think we always ended it with a blowjob, so I'm really worried going into my next relationship if having an abnormally low sex drive is acceptable? Or is there something wrong with me  I just don't get why I'm never in the mood now especially since I'm way less stressed now when I'm going to graduate compared to like before A levels and trying to get into uni.

With the accident, I gave up all hope for promotion and was just very thankful that I still had a job. However, lately, I was told by my senior manager (or my boss, for want of a better word) that they (including my teammates) felt my stress and displeasure at my job.

Never mind that I work longer hours (at my own cost...read: no OT or off-in-lieu) just to ensure that my work is done for the day. And organisations willing to accept 'disabled' persons? They do not exist. A person who is wheelchair bound or who has lost a limb stand a better chance of landing a job.

A is quite attractive, can be considered quite extroverted, have a few fwbs. B, on the other hand is very introverted, but hopes to be like A. Hence B looked up to A and kind of adapted her style. Since girl A is adored by a few men on tinder, girl B wished to be validated by men as well. Didnt end well, girl A indirected girl B and so onnnnnnnnn - they broke friendship Girl A, B and a few other friends including me used to be close, but we split. So now Girl A and i are in the same group project. But because no one wants to take the lead, i made and effort to put things in the right place. When we met up to do things in school, i presume girl A felt left out as she was always using her phone texting her bf. Hence for the whole day, girl A was in a bad mood and snapped at all my group mates to not disturb her. I left her alone because i wanted to finish the project fast so everyone can go home. Fast forward again, i texted her about her using too much phone and ask her to apologise and she did, but continuously indirected me a few times on instagram on how ‘i wasnt understanding towards her’ just because her time of the month is coming. Am i really not understanding enough? did i handle it the right way? Do i really not have the leadership ability? But i ultimately did not want to ‘wear the shoe even if it fits’ , i did not indirect back and chose to act like it doesnt bother me. she made year 2 of poly so hard for me as she’s one of my close friend and we’re going to be in the same group for the rest of the year. lecturers dont help at this point and i dont want to put the rest of my friends in the tight spot. but i would like advise on how i shouldve handled better because these are immature problems that i could have not care but unfortunately, happens in my friend group :”)-#98070: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/98070",10,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I do freelance on the side too (I'm a creative) but because I'm such a junior in the industry, I barely get any clients, and even when I do, I have to lower my prices for someone to engage my service. But, whatevs, I still try my best and I try really hard to save. Like now that we are working from home, I often just buy cheap groceries and cook two meals a day, skipping breakfast. During CB I managed to save a 1.5k a month, but because I'm so bad with self-control, I ended up spending half of my measly savings on delivery food. Stupid.I actually put away $700 every month to save first and plan my finances according to whatever's left after deducting away the things I have to pay for. I ever tried asking my parents if I can defer giving allowance first but they weren't too happy with it, which is why I can only suck thumb and continue to contribute to family expenses. As for marriage, I really wanted to get marry early, maybe in 3-4 years time because both my bf and I don't fancy very happening weddings, we just wanna ROM and that's it, but I guess I had my priorities wrong. Also, he's actually pretty rich, he's just really thrifty, to the point where $5 takeaway food from the hawker centre is also expensive to him. I ever asked him if he could lend me some money to at least clear half my debt and he was pretty willing but I got a scolding from my parents and grandparents cos they said it's not nice to ask my bf for money when we're not married.In the end, my bf only has like 2-3k cash flow now cos all his money is in his endowment plan, investments, crypto and all that stuff lols. Don't need any advice this time, I guess I'll figure it out as long as I continue to be thrifty and careful with my money, but I just needed to get this off my chest, thanks bros and sis.Just wanna say that this all sux.

I have zero investing b/g and not from biz/finance related degree but I do google and research online but there are far too many terminologies and types of investments which causes me to be overwhelmed by all the information. I am very prudent and have the habit of saving about half of my monthly salary (not alot only 3K+). I don't have any major commitments at the moment. My peers are also facing similar issues as me... I read that first timers should buy SSB as they are low risk. I am not a massive risk taker (e.g crypto) as I don't wish to see my hard earn money gone just like that but at the same time I also want my money to grow instead of just leaving it in multiplier savings account.

I've tried dating apps for a couple of years and don't really see it going anywhere. Being a returning Singaporean, I don't have many friends locally and I don't want to try finding romance in my workplace so as to keep work and personal life apart. I'm also rather romantically unexperienced, having only had a very short relationship before in universityAbout myself for context: Graduated from a top university in Japan, I work in finance with a rather high pay, and also own my own property. I think I'm average looking with an average height and weight, quite introverted. I was a nerd in school but a sporty nerd, being in some athletic teams.I do get matches but it's nearly impossible to keep conversations going. Some are boring, some are outright creepy. I don't sext or anything, because I'm looking for a serious relationship. Most of the profiles (my age bracket) also do seem to have put in rather low effort: no descriptions ; horrible grammar/spelling; or one-liners like ""ask me yourself"" or ""I'm a potato"" (what???). I've even seen stuff like ""marry me pls if you're Lee Min Ho"", as well as dozens of insurance agents.For those where we made it to a date, it seems like some of them want dates to be absolutely perfect like some korean drama and they need to know if the person they are meeting is Mr Right just on the first date. Like some of them would compare our date to what they see their friends having on IG, and tell me, ""oh my friend's boyfriend brought her to xxxxx"" (I'm not even your boyfriend yet!) If it matters, I've always paid for or offered to pay for the first date, and turned up early to scout around. Even for those dates that turned out fine, she eventually ghosts me or I ghost them because I find them too talkative or clingy.I'm starting to feel the pressure to find my life partner because I see my friends getting married or welcoming children into their families, but I don't want to compromise either. I recently spoke with my ex-classmate who asked if I'm still single and when he could come to my wedding.If there is anyone else who lived overseas like me and doesn't have a strong ""Singapore network"" and could share some tips with me, I would be very grateful.

First of all, I know y'all don't have a very good feeling toward international students and I perfectly understand that. And I also fully understand that international students are not the school's priority. So please don't bother with those comments because I don't give 2 shits about how yall feel about intl' students.But I think there is a certain line of respect that the school have to show to their students even if they are an international student. For those of you who don't know; all the intl students are like sitting ducks rn because the school haven't released whether it will be online or offline next sem. Yall might think what's the big deal about it and tbh for locals, it isn't much of a problem. But for intl students, it means we can't decide whether to stay in Singapore or go back to our home country and we have to wait on our expensive housing contract of at least 1k+ until the school makes a decision. You might say ""you can work during the hols to make up for it."" Well right now due to government policy, firms are simply not hiring intl students except for very special cases. You might say ""just take LOA"" but as an intl student, there is a VISA complication if you take LOA (I didn't know as well until I was told by CFG). So yeah the situation is tough for us but the only thing the school is saying is simply ""there is nothing we can do.""I know for sure at least one of you will say ""if you got an issue go back to your own country la, no one asked you to come here to take our job."" and I understand where that is coming from but that is not the point here.What I expect from the school is at least help the international students with the accommodation or at least announce that the exams and lessons will be done in an online format so we have an option to go back and don't waste our money.Sorry for the long post; I just wanted to rant about it since I am getting too depressed.

Besides that, I ran into him in school at different venues almost everyday (Coincidence 1). We started from a simple ""Hello/Bye Bye"" to a causal conversation and following each other on IG. I had a crush on him but I got to know that he had a girlfriend from his IG posts. I followed his posts and stories closely. I also got to know that we interned at the same location but different companies (Coincidence 2). After we graduated, I thought that it was impossible and hence I stopped thinking about him. Little did I expect to run into him again but in a different school. We were both in NUS (Coincidence 3). He initiated a conversation with me and we began to chat with each other occasionally on Telegram. He was still with his Girlfriend at that point of time. While chatting with him, I asked if his Girlfriend would mind that he kept chatting with other girls like me and he replied no. Recently, I'm doing my internship. As for him, he graduated and is working full-time. We increased our conversations by talking about our work. One day, he messaged me that he felt heartbroken because he broke up with his Girlfriend after so many years together because of her family issues. A few days later, he also told me that he let her go easily and he recovered from the break up very quickly (Question 1: Why did he let me know all these information?). Nevertheless, we began to chat even more till it became an everyday thing and I felt really drawn to him. Soon he kept asking me to go out with him (Question 2: Does he like me back?

How many other people out there actually cheated on their partner, tortured their partner, or other people for that matter, and still walk free, as though they've done nothing wrong? Truly thankful for the few who actually gave constructive feedback though, it warmed my heart and I'm going to seek therapy for this.To those who called me a slut, told me I belonged to the streets, what are you? How great are you that you have the rights to insult me without knowing me and my full story? Who are you to judge me? When those thoughts surface, I force myself to not think of it, I distract myself, and I try my hardest to stop thinking of that guy I met. Do you see that? You don't. The person who told me not to use the word love again, maybe after all that I've gone through, I know the word love more than you will ever know. I come from a broken family, I got raped, played by men, degraded, insulted, and trampled on, and now that I finally met a guy who truly loved me, even when I was so undeserving of his love, he taught me how to be a good person, he picked me up, and his selfless love really pushes me to change. Disgusting thoughts like this can't go away overnight, but I am trying my hardest, and I never acted upon my thoughts. Do you see that? You don't. I used NUSWhispers simply as a platform to get it off my chest as I go on my journey of finding myself again and getting rid of those thoughts, but so many of you took this chance to insult me and make me feel less than of you. This is how disgusting humans have become. You choose to see what you want to see, instead of seeing how angry I am at myself (which I stated at the end of the post), you chose to hate on me when you could have encouraged me and gave me constructive criticisms.

#98015,17/5/2021,"Not sure if this Confession makes sense. Not sure if I need any advise even. Just something that has been bothering me. I am a guy. Few years back, hooked up with a girl in club. That was my first time about to have sex. She was pretty, figure was above average as well. Checked into hotel, excited, nervous, felt like a king inside. After foreplay, did I manage to have sex? No. I tried. I was hurting. My foreskin was not fully able to retract. I stop the session and apologies to her. She laughed and we just hug each other to sleep. Whole night we have been kissing. That’s pretty much it. We exchange numbers and kept in contact. Texted each other everyday. After that incident, I retract my foreskin fully, so that I can have sex with her LOL. Subsequently, we became FWB. Soon, we decided to do things other than sex. Movies, shopping, cafe dates etc, basically what couples do. I enjoyed every moment with her, I then realised I fell for her. Did I confess to her during that time, Yes. Did she became my gf. No. Various reasons, time not right, she enjoys this moment etc. Our relationship ended close to 2 years. How did it end, she told me we need to stop this as she got pregnant. The baby was not mine. She was certain. She even show me the blood test report, was with another guy. I was heartbroken. At that point of time, I hoped it would be mine. I even told her to get an abortion. All kinds of reason to keep her. She was unwilling. Our relationship came to an end. She got married eventually.Fast forward today. I am actually in a relationship for 2 years. A loving girlfriend. More pretty and hot than my first and only FWB. Both of us have good income, good vibes, good relationship. I can foresee starting a family with her in the near future. However, just a part of me here and there reminds me of my FWB. I still check on her once every few months on ig or fb. I blocked her, but when I think of her I unblock and check on her. Every time I look at her photo, memories still lingers on. I know this is definitely not right. I know this is bad for sure. My best friends know this. They told me maybe it was my first sex, my first time in love. My first date. I did alot of first time with her. I do know that I got played by her. I was her sex toy or object wadever. I do know that my current girlfriend is 10x better in all aspect. But yea, just a part of me can’t forget this. Maybe like what my friend said, I did not have a good closure. My friend ask questions that stun me. “Would you be together with her or your current girlfriend given a chance”. “Would you do better to keep your FWB”. “Would you want to meet her for a closure?” I got so tempted to text her to ask her out. But nope I din’t. And never would I do that.That’s all guys. Just wanted to vent out my feelings. Sorry for the long post. Just another loser that falls in love with FWB and got played hahaha.

#97994,17/5/2021,"Often we hear ""it takes a village to raise a child"". But what has happened to the vilage of today? Many people nowadays prefer less trouble because of the consequences should social media be involved, and maybe the hassle that comes with disciplining a child who has parents with an abundance of resources to come after you should their child feel a slight sense of unhappiness.Let's look at a very common example if you are willing to indulge in me:A child/teenager litters or drops food by accident (and decides he is not going to eat it anymore) and is schooled by an adult. Shouldn't the parent be thankful that someone is helping them to teach your child when they are not available? If the boy was asked to pick up the litter, and he doesn't, isn't it clear that the parent's teachings are not significant enough (if he was taught) for him to refuse/ignore the request? And if he was made to pick up the litter, but picks up only a fraction of those which could be picked up easily, isn't it blatantly obvious that he does not really know about the correct social behaviour (or even refuses to behave in that manner)?For me, as an educator, my job is to educate not just in terms of knowledge about the subjects I teach such as Math or Malay Language, but in terms of character as well. Let's say I were to encounter your son in the example above or even in some other examples of behavioural issues. These are the things I want to say to parents or parents-to-be:If I discipline your child, I mean well, and it will be in a way that your child will listen to and not just say ""yes"" and get back to his old ways almost instantaneously. If your child feels upset from his or her encounter with me because of things I say, I will say that is because your child has internalised what I have told them, which is why they will feel upset: because they will sorry about what they have done. If your child leaves the encounter aloof, it means the encounter has no effect on your child, and I will humbly admit that my talk with your child has no effect. If your child leaves the encounter happy, something must be wrong. If I bring you, as parents, into the picture, it is for your child to think about you and your family. Because for me to discipline a student that I have not seen or taught before, let's agree I will have no rapport, and the only way to make him consider about what I say is to invoke the connection he has with you. If I ask your child if you have taught your child on whether we should clean up after ourselves, I am not doubting what you have taught them, neither am I insinuating anything. I am just clarifying, because if you have taught him, I will question why is he not following your teachings? If you have not taught him, then I will teach him so he will know what to do the next time.Why do I say these? Because many parents are now seeing that they need to make up for the lack of time with their children by being their knights in shining armour. They jump to the defence of the child instantly and fault the teachers by twisting the words of teachers (or maybe the child twisted it). The moment I mention that child's parents, the parents imemdiately think they are being targetted (maybe because of a guilty conscience of not spending enough time with their child?) Take a moment to think about it: if teachers do not care, why would we bother ourselves with things that may subject ourselves to possible complaints? We are so busy all the time, why would we spend precious time disciplining a student that is not in our own form classes? Take another moment to think: if people can have many faces towards different people, can't your child act differently at home and in school?It does not help that some schools tend to be on the parents' side because schools function like businesses nowadays. ""The customer is always right"" attitude should never be adopted in schools. In short, teachers get thrown under the bus, and once the bus rolls over the teacher like a hump, the teacher has to crawl to the front of the bus and say, ""I'm sorry for making your journey an uncomfortable one.""I feel that the village has really died with the development of city life.Dear fellow whisperers, I implore all of you to educate this educator on what I should do.

What's more, they become SAF scholars and eventually generals to a large extent based on how well they did during their A levels.It's really much better to let suitable people to lead rather than parachuting SAF generals to leadership positions, both in the public and private world.Enough said, I am now going to show my officer rank insignia when my interviewer asks me for my working experience.Onward and forward-#97971: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97971",15,6,0,0,20,77,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basically fine with getting to know guys in these comfortable social context zone. In school at most hang together with mutual friends, hv meals together or study together. I get butterflies when guys subtly flirt with me or do romantic gestures or say sweet stuff. Enjoy texting back too. Yet when guys ask me out for a date outside of school or cca or hall, I feel apprehensive and very awkward. Dont look forward to hanging together outside and especially when hanging alone. Not sure how to sustain conversations? Prefer being in school or hall just being in each other’s presence or even just texting. As a result of this problem, I have remain single even though I do like guys and they have tried to chase me too. Simply because I find it too awkward and tedious to date people. I do want to date though! Will these problem of mine disappear once I find “the one”, someone I naturally click with and actually want to hang out with all the time. Friends have advised me that I only dont want to go out with guys because I just dont “like” them enough. Is this true?

#97948,17/5/2021,"I am a millennial currently taking a 10 minutes break from work, happy to jump onto the bandwagon to talk about the hot topic of toxic boomers and Generation XSo first, this is the storyline we were made to believe in. The Baby Boomers (and Gen X) were a great generation. Born out of the post war era, they seize the opportunities at hand and lay the foundations of our modern world. We as millennials should appreciate them for that. Boomers? Industrious, tough, resourceful. Millennials? Whiny, weak, attention seeking, strawberry, avocadoHere's a response, these are some of the observations on the boomers and Gen X folks, most were gathered from the internet and social media, the millennial's best friend:- They are usually entitled troublemakers: ""Do you have a badge?""- They tend to be xenophobic, racist and sexist: ""I am from Hwa Chong JC and will never mix around with you guys because we’re so different""- They are easily offended: ""I take embrage at your first question""- They are quite ungrateful: ""Give one chicken wing take back whole chicken""And then the topics escalates:- They created an education system that results in graduates enter the workforce with uni student loan ranging from $20k to $200k- They created a housing system where housing affordability is at an all time low for even our first home- They leave behind a sizeable carbon footprint: Enough to warm the earth by 1.7 degrees celsius but not the cockles of our heartsI (and I meant the internet) don't mean to generalize but hey, millennials are strawberries is a generalization too.No wonder we are all have a varying degree of depression and mental health issues. Pls seek help when necessary, do post on NUSWhispers for encouragement and filter out the unnecessary opinions from the trolls. You deserve better than from attention seeking boomers looking for validation on how 'smart' they are. They do not speak all boomers. My biggest worry is that the world that we would inherit one day is a messy one. There is an unprecedented amount of issues that we will need to tackle: Xenophobia, racism, climate change, human rights, global food shortage, ageing population, broken healthcare system, rising income gap and the list goes on. Even today, we are living through one of the biggest crisis of our lifetime with no end in sight. Of course, boomers are not to be blamed in entirety, we are merely 'part of the system'.On a more encouraging note, this is a call for rally for millennials and Gen Z to take action through our own ways, and I wish we would be known for being the generation that solve these issues some day.Now, back to work and be the hardworking millennial I am.-#97948: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97948",0,1,0,0,0,22,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

#97946,17/5/2021,"Just my two cents on all the girls & NS talk.Firstly, I just want to say that I'm writing this to have an opinion-sharing discussion, just wanna know how others feel about my opinion, can even correct me if you don't agree with me, etc. (no fightings please and please don't try to force your opinions on anyone else).My stand? I'm do not support girls having to do mandatory NS.Reason? Firstly, I personally can totally imagine my monthly-mood-swing self to be pointing a gun at someone demanding they stfu or even myself rolling around in pain or just resorting to spending my whole day on the toilet during my period or when cramps are just so bad. I know that even if a new law comes out that says that girls must serve NS as well, it wouldn't affect me since I'm already past that age and it'll just affect my future child (if I even have one). I'm just saying, I hope people don't underestimate some females and their periods (I know not many have the same symptoms but I personally get really bad cramps sometimes and I just wanna kill everyone who comes within 2m of myself and I'm sure I'm not the only one who has bad cramps).Secondly, I personally feel that females are at a disadvantage when it comes to career progression. I know we talk so big about gender equality but honestly speaking (at least from my very limited experience), I don't see that many female managers (at least not in my last 2 and current workplaces). I mean, we surely can't deny that childbirth is indeed something that females have to consider in their career planning. If we have to take another 2 years of NS into the plan, wouldn't the average age of females during their first child birth increase? Wouldn't that just mean less childbirths? Anyway, these are just my 2 cents. Hoping to hear some more meaningful insights.-#97946: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97946",19,3,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The problem, however, is that many of these commenters are downright toxic and dismissive. Please la, different generations have their own struggles.

It’s strange how people try to explain it away as that means the other party doesn’t love you, or how it’s insulting. If you love the person even if they had no assets, you’ll sign it. I know a few couples who signed with no hesitation and no drama, because you want to marry the person anyway and don’t care about their assets. It’s not wrong to not want to sign it, but just be upfront and honest and say “I think I deserve a share of your success for supporting you “.

#97890,17/5/2021,"There are a few lapses that led to Covid 19 being seeded into the community which led to out of control outbreaks and the tightened restrictions today. These lapses are totally commonsensically preventable and it doesn't take a genius to realise what they are.1.Staff wear full PPE, but that PPE is not idiot proof. A fatigued tester may inadvertently  scratch his face with gloves on , or inadvertently touch the outside of his mask  or gown with bare hands... Mistakes do happen. Testers are human, you can't expect them to be 100% on the ball all the time, and it only takes one mistake and you have an epidemic on your hands. Given the thousands of imported cases, such an accident happening is statistically inevitable.2.the staff serving travellers are allowed to mingle and eat with people from the public. This one is self explanatory.3. Travellers serve SHN in places distant from the airport. Who is to say they will not infect the driver (who also comes from the community) or stop somewhere illegally to pee, etc?4.PCR test is not 100% accurate, yet authorities allow people who test negative to shortcut their SHN even though they may be false negative and still have the virus. Contrary to popular belief, a 99% accuracy(sensitivity)  does not mean that if you test 3 times on the same person , then the odds of him testing false negative is 1 in 1 million. It simply means that out of 100 patients rested, one will test false negative.All it takes is one person who slip out of the safety net, and the whole nation is screwed!It is not infeasible to make a safety net that is 99.99% foolproof. Here's what I think should have been done.The authorities should have made changi airport into a self contained facility. Turn changi airport into a self sufficient town with its own amenities, shopping mall  , gyms, parks ,libraries ( I think most already are there).All the staff and their families live on dormitories and converted hotels on site and nobody is allowed to leave. Only goods can go in and out, coz covid 19 is not transmitted by goods.All dedicated facilities for SHN must be located within the confines of the changi airport bubble, so that there is no risk of travellers infecting people on the way to SHN facility in town.Everybody who leaves changi airport must quarantine for 21 days. Travellers should be separated into cohorts according to the day of entry. There will be 21 cohorts, and each cohort will be served by a separate staff, and no intermingling between cohorts and staff serving each cohort is allowed. That way, there is absolutely no possibility for a traveller who has already served 20 days of quarantine, for example, to be infected by a staff member who recently served a traveller with just 1 day of quarantine.Everybody should strictly serve 21 days of quarantine, and there will be no exceptions.

Understand it’s covid and like everyone is just trying to adjust. Students and Profs adjusting to the new online learning and teaching BUT shouldn’t NUS step up and try to help & listen to feedbacks and be more empathetic towards students. Firstly, I tried to convince myself that paying 9K for a sem is justifiable but I really can’t. Anw, I am a Singaporean and 9K is the amount after all that subsidies. Please hear me out! Because man, I only get to go back to school once every 2 week and I can’t even enjoy/ use the facilities. So it pains me to see how money is being ‘wasted’ and not properly utilised. I can’t imagine the coming sem being like this too. It’s really a burden for my family too. To add on why this 9K isn’t justifiable, my prof from SDE didn’t even bother teaching. Instead he just reuse and replay his 2019&2020 recording during our zoom lecture sessions. WTF! I don’t see how the profs can use such minimal effort to conduct online class. Does your prof come into zoom lecture and hit the replay button from his past lecture recording to teach? I understand how we should all be kinder and more accepting but again, this sheer laziness really doesn’t justify how learning should be done. Some students wrote into the school for actions to be done but they have been turned away. Secondly, regarding online examination, I am unsure why some prof doesn’t want to use examsoft aka examplify to conduct examination. This particular prof conducted an online open book examination with zoom proctoring. The instructions he gave were signs of loopholes for possible cheating and dishonesty. For instance when the exam ended at 12, he still allowed student to submit 30 mins later without penalising them. Some students even took the opportunity the resubmit their scripts online which made me ponder if they did cheat. (Tell me if my suspicion could be right?) I mean who knows if students use WhatsApp/ telegram to communicate since we were allow to take pictures for our scripts and send via these communication platform. Earlier last year, some students even got into a heated ‘debate’ with a prof regarding how he want to conduct the examination.

#97896,17/5/2021,"Anyone here a reptile specialist? I need a way to deal with office snakes. It’s been a year since I’ve joined my new company, and for the longest time I’ve even putting up with a toxic senior at work. I used to brush those feelings aside, and thought I was overthinking; but in recent times I’ve found that my instincts were right since Day 1. Working with this senior was an absolutely traumatising experience, because I felt that I was on the receiving end of workplace bullying.   Many times I’ve worked with her, she would snap at me when I’m explaining my work; she uses a sharp and discouraging tone at me and my ideas; nothing I did was right, nothing I said was right. And being new to the industry, and requiring technical help, I didn’t have the confidence to retaliate or stand up for myself. After a few nasty interactions she would then be nice and friendly with me, sending me confusing signals.In meetings she would try to shush me when I tried to speak up, and too every chance she could to put me down; I even suspected that she spoke ill to my boss behind my back, because my boss seemed to have such a negative impression of me even though I just joined the company. I genuinely think she exploited her position to put me in a bad light. Friends told me she was insecure and threatened, but what she did was absolutely unprofessional. Even when I asked for links for project documents (not confidential btw) to understand our team’s projects, she’ll be like “what information do you need for it? Why do you need it?”, as though she’s trying to keep me out. Today was the last straw, because I opened up her birthday message to me.  It said something along the lines of, how I’ve been having a tough time, and to go wherever I wanted and to do whatever I wanted. I found this absolutely passive aggressive, as though she’s trying to chase me out. It’s very inappropriate to talk to me, about me leaving the firm, when I clearly never brought this matter up. The worst of all, is that everyone else has such a good impression of her, so I’m dealing with this alone. The only thing worse that seeing a ghost, is to be the only person seeing the ghost.

#97856,17/4/2021,"NUS commencement ceremonyYesterday (20 May 2021), NUS has announced to hold the commencement ceremonies online instead of in-person for the class of 2020 and 2021. This is due to the rising number of covid-19 infection in Singapore since April this year. I agree with NUS that considering the tightened government measures and the health and safety of ourselves, family and friends who will be attending the ceremonies, it is in our best interests to not hold the in-person ceremonies as originally scheduled in June and July. However, I am disappointed in the way that NUS handled this. I listed down 3 reasons below:1. There were ample opportunities for NUS to hold the ceremonies for the class of 2020 in February and March 2021. During this period, there were few covid cases in Singapore, and the government has gradually permitted a larger group of social gathering. Two universities in Singapore, the SIT and SIM, had taken advantage of this opportunity and held in-person graduation ceremonies in this period. Knowing that the covid situation is fluid and can change quickly, NUS should quickly grab hold of the opportunity in February and March to hold the graduation ceremonies for the class of 2020. 2. For the class of 2021 whose graduation ceremonies were supposed to take place this year, NUS changed the graduation ceremonies to online instead of postponing it to a later date to see if the situation improves. This is unlike what NUS did for the class of 2020, where the graduation ceremonies were postponed for a year, and an attempt was made to hold it in January 2021 (which ultimately did not happen because of tight government measures) before the decision was made to change to the online ceremony.  I find it hard to understand why did NUS make the swift decision to hold online ceremonies for the class of 2021 where currently, the covid-19 vaccine is being rolled out and the covid situation could improve in a year, making in-person ceremonies possible. 3. Based on the swift decision that NUS made to hold online ceremonies for the class of 2021 and the responses from the NUS students that I gathered from social media, it is clear that NUS did not seek the opinion of the students, the people who the graduation is meant for, before deciding to hold online ceremonies.  Despite these disappointing observations, I am heartened to know that NUS students have already taken to an online platform, change.org, to get signatures to call for NUS to re-look at its decision. This shows that although NUS did not take the initiative to speak with students, the students are not willing to stay silent. They will speak up and continue to do so until NUS is willing to listen. This is not the first time that NUS students have turned to the online platform to raise issues that NUS overlooked. If you search on change.org alone, you will see several more examples. These are good signs since universities are places where students go to learn to think critically, not follow blindly.  All in all, I am disappointed in the way NUS handled the graduation ceremonies for the class of 2020 and 2021. NUS could have better manage this and many other past issues if they have communicated with students, and include student's opinions in their decision-making process. Moving forward, NUS should think of ways to communicate with students more often, such as holding meetings between students representatives and the management team every semester.-#97856: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97856",2,4,0,0,1,14,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

#97851,17/4/2021,"I wonder how many people will attend the virtual commencement. For Class of 2020, it’s been almost a year since we received the certificate. Most of us have started working or proceeded with further studies. The ceremony is more of seeing your classmates again, going back to NUS one more time and reminiscing the undergraduate life. Of course, there could be other reasons, like for our families. I think we can safely say that the ceremony is more for the memories.We have waited this long, only to know NUS decides they opt for a virtual ceremony instead. I understand that the school has tried, and we appreciated that. Remember the thankful comments last year when they announced to hold a physical ceremony at a later date? But NUS has obviously given up trying at this point, which is why this is disappointing. I am not saying do the ceremony now. Instead, have it another time, when it’s safer.“What if it takes 3/4/5/6/7/8/9 years for things to be safer? The staff will suffer from organising the commencement. The hall isn’t big enough for this” Worst case scenario, it took us a few years to recover from COVID. There would be quite a lot of graduates but similarly we were having the ceremony in batches anyway. The number of virtual attendees could be way lesser. Easier to plan, but why are we taking the easy way out here? I foresee the virtual commencement can happen in 2 ways via zoom or whatever online platform:1. Default setting where you see the participants in boxes. People can choose to on their camera or not. Then the various speeches, followed by a roll call. Meanwhile, we just sit in front of the screen and listen. Why would people take time off their schedule for this experience? Puzzles me.2. Webinar style. Well this is probably worst. If there could be other ways a virtual commencement could be fun and celebratory, please share. I understand that not everyone wants to attend a commencement (virtual or physical). It is fine, but there are people that want to attend it. Having a virtual one removes the actual experience some of us were looking for.

I don’t know if I want to continue this but I’m scared that I will regret. Also, I’m not the type of speak up so I’m really scared how he would react. I feel like that it will be my fault.

#97843,17/4/2021,"Holding our commencement ceremony online feels like a spit in our faces. Many of us has had a mentally tough 4 years, particularly in 2020. We do not seem to be getting any support from the school. They ask us to unite with the rest of Singapore, but NUS does not seem to be united with us. We are the batch who are the most affected by Covid-19. Our exchange were cancelled/recalled, our lessons were replaced with recordings (even lecturers uploading past semesters lecture recordings), we were restricted from even going to school. We were paying the same school fees nonetheless. Don’t we deserve at least a bit more from a university “consistently ranked amongst the world’s best”?Maybe this feels like an entitled opinion. But to have a virtual commencement feels like tokenism. It feels like NUS is taking the easy way out so as to no have to deal with administrative inconveniences of planning and holding a physical ceremony. We are students/alumnus, not customers. We are not buying the degree and formality. If we were really to have an online commencement, maybe it would be better off if NUS would just upload 2019’s commencement video onto Luminus for us to download like we do for lectures. We are used to it anyway. Those who want to can even watch it at 2x speed. Yes, we are in a global health crisis and there are many more pressing issues. We do not need the ceremonies to be held right now. The batch of 2020 have already waited excitedly for one year. I believe many of us are willing to wait longer, even if it is held in batches. A virtual commencement loses its significance even if traditional proceedings are retained. To the management team, perhaps you do not have children, perhaps none of your children have graduated, perhaps all have graduated. But for our parents, to miss out on seeing their child graduating in person, being relegated to watching a computer screen after investing so much does not seem fair. They have waited 23-26 years for this day. I’m sure even you  all had fond memories from your time in university and at your commencement ceremony when standing next to your loved ones wearing the gown. I am not asking it on behalf of us students, but for our parents for all their sacrifice. They deserve better.I really hope that NUS will reconsider this decision, and to not have the commencement online. Please do not deny us this proud once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Postponed Commencement for 2021 batch to later date because of the rise in cases and the importance of physical Commencement for both the students and the families4. Did not restrict students' access to the University facilities and Campus during Phase 2 so as not to cause too much inconvenience to students wanting to come to Campus and use facilities5. Did not result in Covid cluster although there were few students who were tested positiveNUS:1. No SU during 2021 Sem 1 because you have already gotten use to the past half-Semester of Zoom teachings2. Postponed Commencement for 2020 batch to coincide with 2021 Commencement, planned for 6 months after Phase 3 even though they have plenty of opportunity to conduct3. Cancelled both physical Commencement for 2020 and 2021 batches and transit to virtual instead, because it is not fair to postpone for 2021 batch but not 2020 batch, but hey let's just get these 2 batches over and done with even though there is a decent chance for 2021 Commencement to be conducted at a later date4. No students were allowed to come to school when they had no lessons during Phase 2. No students shall use the Campus's facilities and study in school if you do not have any lesson on that day. Hey let's slapped another Zoning restriction to prevent students from walking around in Campus. You want to go to UTown but were from Biz? Nah bro ain't letting you do so.5. Forces students to download a poorly-named App and to show a colored Pass whenever they want to buy food on Campus or take the shuttle bus. Never mind that our wifi sucks and some students could not connect to it at times. While we are at it, why not install a bunch of big TV screens in canteens to display ads, so that students cannot see the stall menu.6.

Follow SOP and do things safely. However in doing so they have caused tons of frustrations and inconvenience to students and staff, while unilaterally implementing restrictive policies. One can't help but wonder that NTU's actions show more signs of taking students' welfare, convenience and university life into account compared to NUS, where it is not convincing to believe that NUS makes actions by taking into consideration the students first.

More background on what's happening - both me and my fiancé are local but my fiancé's mom is a westerner so a prenup is very important to her, which, oddly speaking she and her husband dont even have one and yet, she's asking her son to do one with me. So to further explain, I make 4k/month and my fiancé makes 12k/month. His mom thinks so highly of him and thinks he has a lot of money. I mean, if I was a mom who has a son doing so well in life I'd too also but his mom doesn't know the struggles his son is going through. We both have student loans, bills and family to support.. I never have any issues with him supporting his family, his brother especially since he is still in university and as a big brother, he wants to give his brother a good life and not go through hardship like we both did - working part time and studying while trying to get our degrees. We've been struggling to save for our wedding too, cutting down on our expenses etc. Actually in fact, his mom doesn't know a lot about our hardship the last 8 years. To her, her son is some sort of a star that she's always so proudly boasting on Facebook to her friends. Prenup is honestly just the tip of the iceberg on why I'm re-evaluating my decision if I want to continue the wedding. Despite being together for the last 8 years since I was 18, we only got engaged just last year in 2020 after I asked him if he had ever thought of marrying me? This is also mainly because my mom nagged at me for being in a relationship for too long haven't settle down yet. It also took him quite some time to tell his mom he proposed to me, which was a kind of pathetic the way he propose but I've learned to let go cause I don't want to be petty and hold grudge on how other people gets nice proposal but not me. His reason for not telling his mom because he dont want her to feel weirded out that we haven't live together but already considering settling down. There is a lot more actually but it'll be too long to list out what I'm feeling. So him mentioning prenups was honestly the last straw for me. I dont know if this is normal for couples to have so many arguments before the wedding or am I just unlucky?

I did an additional internship without all the bureaucracy of NUS internship system, and I actually could focus on doing a good internshipBefore the internship starts, you have to waste time getting HR to re-post the job posting on talent connect, then u make a re-application, then the HR makes a re-offer, then u make a re-accept. during the internship, you have to write a 20 page report about the company. on top of that, you need to get your manager to write a report as well to satisfy the staff in charge of NUS internships. I understand that the staff in charge of NUS internships need to show that they are doing something, but this cannot come at the cost of students trying to do a good internship. the system is a huge waste of time, takes away focus from doing a good internship, has zero value add for the students. this needs to changebtw, PSA for juniors: talent connect is filled to the brim with these invalid reposts, use linkedin/glassdoor/indeed/company website instead of talent connect. in my first year of applying for internships, I thought the talent connect postings were legit, and it caused me to waste a huge amount of time on these useless applications. almost none of the applications on talent connect resulted in an interview. whereas, there was a high rate of interviews for the mainstream job sites. if u submitted applications via talent connect and didn't hear back, just wanted to let u know that it is not because u are bad, it is because talent connect is bad (to put it mildly)-#97829: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97829",1,2,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

#97823,17/4/2021,"Hi all, I am from the class of 2020 and have just received the news regarding the virtual commencement. Suffice to say, I am extremely disappointed at how the situation turned out. I can't say the same for others but commencement to me was important for one main reason - it was a day dedicated to my parents. Raised from poor households, both of my parents couldn't afford to study, they were thrown into the low-skilled workforce at in their teens and have never looked back since. It would come as no surprise that they were often green with envy when looking at graduation photos of other families. It was then when I decided I needed to make their dreams come true, that this would (quite possibly) be one of the proudest moments they will be of me, when they would see me on stage, graduating with a degree they couldn't have attained themselves. To people who are gonna comment the following - here are my responses:""It's just a ceremony, they are already proud of you"": But the ceremony is monumental, it would really mean something to them ""You've already graduated, who even cares about it anymore"": I just feel that it's such a pity for my parents, I just feel that it's a missed once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make them happy""You could just take photos with your parents somewhere else"": That's exactly what we would do, but I feel that a huge part of the commencement experience would be lost if it's virtual.""Stop whining"": This post is all that I will rant about this matterIn conclusion, I just feel that making it virtual would mean that the commencement has lost a significant portion of meaning (for me at least), and that it would just be an easy way out for NUS. I may be selfish in preferring to wait another year to getting it done and over with through zoom, but I would like to be selfish just this once. I dream of the day when my parents could witness first-hand me receiving my graduation scroll in my gown on stage.-#97823: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97823",0,4,0,18,0,38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It’s the time where our parents get a chance to witness a once in a lifetime opportunity to see their child on stage receiving their degree from a prestigious university like NUS. I’m very sure he/she is not the only one feeling as such. It sucks that the school was not quick enough to hold a ceremony at the start of the year when things were stable just like how NTU did. It definitely sucks that instead of waiting it out till the end of the year, they were rash to change it to a virtual event. There is no harm in waiting it out right now.

#97814,17/4/2021,"Dear Student Union (NUSSU), I think it is evident from the sentiments of the graduates and soon-to-be graduates that the decision from the school administration was indeed a demoralising one. The prestige and traditions of such ceremonies have to be upheld - even if it needs to be further scaled-down (at later dates) or even postponement again during the December period. The decision has to be made with each cohort in mind, i.e. the Class of 2021 can still afford to see one cycle of postponement much like the decision from NTU. This is a lack of justifiable rationale for the present arrangement and a virtual commencement does not reflect the same prestige of in-person commencement. It does not absolutely make any sense to reinvent virtual ceremonies when the sentiments on the ground are disjointed, disappointment and frustration. There needs to be appropriate justice for the rigour one has taken in a one-in-a-lifetime milestone and after the financial sacrifices for many families alike. Commencement is not an event. Traditions need to be upheld.

Please post this version instead, thank you.Dear C, if you see this, I hope you'll learn from your mistakes, but I'm sorry that I can't be with you. Not because I have lost feelings for you, but because I can no longer see you the same anymore. After several weeks of meeting each other, I gave you my exclusivity by terminating my chats with other guys whom I met online. Despite how nice they were to me, I told myself to be fair to you as well, because I met you first, and your awesome treatment towards me deserved some respect from me. I asked you if you were still chatting with other dates or planning to meet them, but you said no, and continued dating me until the day we officially became a couple. After 3 weeks, you began acting cold towards me. You tend to take longer to reply to my messages, sometimes you even forgot to wish me goodnight and just headed to bed, and I could only accept the fact that you were tired and went to bed without overthinking too much. You went to meet your friends without asking me, though you knew I'd always say yes because I treat this as basic courtesy and respect between us, but now you just dropped me a text telling me that you're meeting your friends. You started using exam and CCA as excuses to stop meeting up with me for lunch, dinner, and even hanging out together, though I knew how little time you actually needed for that semester. Fast forward to a week later, you came clean to me by telling me that you shouldn't have been together with me, because some girls on dating app whom MIA you actually replied to your texts and initiated to meet up, and you guys were still in touch with each other. You said you just continued to text each other without meeting them in person and felt that they might be more suitable for you. I take this as emotional cheating, but whether or not you guys have met, though you said you haven't, this is no longer something that could hurt me more than your breakup with me.Several months later you texted me again, telling me that you still love me, just because you went out for dates with them and realized that they are not your type. I'm sorry, I'm not a replacement, I'm not an option for you to choose when you had no choice, I'm not somebody who can accept you whenever you are available for such ""good"" reason. You went out with them, you had fun with them, you texted them happily everyday, and lied to me about you only texting me exclusively. I thought that was a fair game where if I stopped texting and meeting other guys because I have decided to stay focused solely on you, then you should do the same for me too. Even if you didn't, you should have at least told me, and right now I just feel stupid for giving you such privilege. I could have continued meeting other guys, some of them are doing well in their career, some are better looking than you, but I chose you.C, to be very honest with you, I could see myself giving you a second chance if you were to apologize to me earlier when I was still contemplating to salvage this relationship, but not now when I'm enjoying being single without being hurt anymore. Please stop telling me how sorry you feel about this whole situation. There is no way I could see us getting together anymore. I hope you will learn from your mistake and avoid doing this to another decent girl that you'll meet next time.-#97801: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97801",11,8,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

He has no time for you now, much less for kids and you in future. Don’t hope. Open your eyes.  Similarly, mine is loyal. Stable job. But that’s all. We quarrel everyday. He scolds the kids everyday because they are too slow. He wants them to complete everything fast so that he can return to his phone. Eat, toilet, tv all need to use phone. He doesn’t care about spending time with me nor settling issues on house or kids. He does not cook, wash, help, plan.. and is contented to just be with his phone everyday. Birthday? Who cares! Confinement? Who cares! Kids need to pack bags? Who cares! Kids hungry? Who cares! Thinking of celebrating something? Who cares! Secretly.. what is worst for me.. is that I have explicitly stated that a certain part of my body is off limits during sex. I also made it overtly known I am uncomfortable with it. He still chooses to do what he likes. I don’t even know if this is assault. But who cares!We also did talk through, quarrel, plead, etc. Each time he will just apologise but you know, a leopard never changes its spots. I have tried to write down, remind, thank him each time he does something for us, in the hope he will realise it’s what works, but nothing can make it. All you want, and I want, is their effort.

A few guys asked me to be his girlfriend. However, I find myself rejecting all of their advances because I cannot forget my crush James, and I want to remain single and available for James if he ask me to be his girlfriend one day. Around two month back, my younger sister (who is my only sibling) brought home her boyfriend and to my surprise he is my crush!

Since then, my crush will come over to our house for meal with our family regularly, and every time it is a painful experience for me, and I have to put on a 'happy face' in front of my family and my crush.

We vibe pretty well, and recently we've been texting each other a bit more than usual. Unknowingly, I started to find myself looking forward to his replies.  I really enjoy his company, way more than I do with my other friends. Every morning, the first person I reply to is him, while I take my time to reply my other friends. I know how wrong this is but I even started to imagine what its like to date him.I know for a fact that I dont feel any 'spark' with him, but at the same time I really enjoy being around him. Before I make a fool of myself, I just want to know what is this that Im feeling right now. As an evergreen girl with no dating experience, Im honestly confused about my feelings.Am I just lonely? Is this purely platonic love? Or do I actually have feelings for him? For the attached couples, how do you know of you like someone?

She graduated from private degree and due to the covid pandemic, she was unable to secure a stable and good paying job. Hence, she decided to become a wealth and financial advisor. I’m totally cool and fine with her decision and respect her job. However, recently she started to message my friends on Facebook and Instagram whether they want to know more about financial planning. I did not know about this and was shocked. My friends had to message and tell me about this. In fact, some of them unfollowed and unfriend me on social media. We had an argument because I felt that it was not really the right thing to do. She started pointing out the girls that I went out with last time into our argument and it became my problem. Her immaturity has become more and more obvious in recent months. I do not really see a possible future but I am too deeply attached to her.

But I can feel that she was hoping for better performance in general. Had FWBs before my relationship, they told me that I am not the best, but good enough. Maybe is because my previous fwbs on bed, all have better reactions than my girlfriend. Hence, my inferior I dunno. Long time ago, my gf also used to share to me before her ex is good in bed. Long and can perform several rounds. Hence, my inferior again lolol i dunno. I do know that we can use hands or tongue or sex toy whatever it is.

I find that he is already biased against me from the assumptions he would find opportunities to put me down.To provide some context, appraisal is coming up in my organisation. My appraiser rose through the ranks as career progression gives higher weight to staff who stays longer in the company.  Recently he made an untimely and unjustified feedback by making unfair statements (close to Appraisal) that I have not been tracking my work at all. I had to rope in my colleague to clarify that it's not the case. How ridiculous. For email write ups, he would write a LONG paragraph to highlight a one liner mistake, and use that as a justification to re-write everything. And yep, he will prob use that an excuse to give me a lower grade. I am wondering if he's insecure because of his 0% exposure private sector experience. He's also new to project managing and first time leading a small team.Last but not least, I found out that he was subtlety spreading gossip when he realised me and another colleague got along v well. I found out when that seniors' clique kept asking if that colleague of mine broke up and kept asking me if I was gg to be attached.

Stuck in a loveless marriage with someone who only cares about himselfI’m female in early 30s and currently a year into a relationship with a selfish man.

After the initial 1-2 months of honeymoon period, it feels like I’ve been giving and giving in this relationship without receiving anything in return and it’s starting to tire me out. Talked it out with him few times before, he just kept saying sorry every time, but until now nothing has changed.My parents are pressuring me to marry due to my age, yet somehow I already know I won’t be happy if I marry him? But at the same time, I’m scared of being alone when I’m old and frail.

#97744,17/4/2021,"hello, 22F just graduated from NUS this sem. (first post pls b kind...) I actually stayed in hall the past 4 years with the exception of (Y3S1 and Y4S1). my last semester in hall was truly one of the worst ones yet. I spent over half the semester crying and only one hall friend who knew had so many commitments that I ended up telling him that I'd stop confiding in him only because he was so bad at replying and constantly flaked on our meetings. I did tell him that if he was free I would be more than happy to talk to him though.. anyways, I guess it must be a lil unexpected that someone who stayed in hall all 4 years of her uni life would feel so shit in the last semester but the main reason why it was so bad imo was because of the friendship problems I had to deal with. to give some context, there's this group of friends that I expected to hang out with since we will be in the same block. I've known them for the past few years but the problem is that they (along with some others) were already an established clique from the previous sem due to zoning and I was really quite worried before moving back as I didn't really know how I would fit in especially because I was on awkward terms with one of the ""some others"" in the clique. moving on the the actual situation of it all: I was actually quite optimistic at the start even though I'm not really the kind to approach others, I did warm up to the group in the first few weeks. something I noticed however was how they would gather in each others' rooms even tho I was in, they never really invited me to hang w them (note: safe distancing was practiced throughout the sem). I did ask my faculty friends about it and they told me that there's no harm just popping by or taking the initiative to ask what time they will be having dinner but honestly, its much easier for them as a group to invite me too because I was often afraid of intruding their time since they didn't invite me even though its so convenient for them to do so. everything was going fine until one night when I asked some of them individually if they will be having dinner that night and they all told me separately that they were either going out for dinner or already had plans. a while later that night I found out that the clique went out for dinner without inviting me but what hurt me the most was how none of them bothered to tell me that I had to make my own dinner plans since we would usually eat together. after that incident, I emotionally withdrew myself a lot and when I talked to one of them about my concerns and how I felt so far, I felt even more alone because it seemed as if everyone only cared about how uncomfortable the other guy seemed around me when he does join the group and no one ever bothered to empathise with how I felt hiding my feelings and pretending that I was okay whenever he was around so that the rest won't feel awkward. At one point of the convo, it felt as if I was the only problem there, causing all the ""weirdness"" and I just felt so bad about myself. I didn't say anything about how I felt from the conversation because I was afraid that it might come off as them not even trying at all. but I really was grateful for the company tho it didn't change how I felt about the smaller day to day things that made me feel left out. after the conversation, I just treated as if everything was sorted out and tried not to dwell on the smaller things. we did hang out more afterwards and had fun times together but there were times too when they talk about their group chat or when I look over and see their matching wallpapers and ultimately feel like I'll never be a part of them. sometimes it felt like everyone already had common knowledge but I'll presume that its because I wasn't in the group chat that I don't really know what's going on.. I know it's stupid to nitpick on these small things but it really does add up especially when everyone is living together.I thought to myself so many times about just ditching everything and move back home earlier or just go home for 1-2 weeks without telling anyone. I think the only reason why I didn't do that was because it was my last semester in hall and I wanted to cherish my stay. I did end up spending more time with my faculty friends tho and I'm happy to have them through all these, especially one whom I ranted to from the start of the semester. now that the sem has ended and I've moved out of hall, I feel more relieved that everything is no longer in-my-face. even though I wasn't added into their group til the end and I still feel sad when I happen see their group photo from that night on social media, it was nice of them to have told me that they hope to be able to hang out in the future. despite saying all of these, I still genuinely think that they are nice people. perhaps they just don't have the capacity to empathise with me or be more tactful in certain situations. there are many other details and incidents that I didn't include (cos rly >4 months worth???) but thanks for reading if you've made it this far!-#97744: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97744",10,2,0,7,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

#97736,17/4/2021,"What is your opinion on trading stocks as a full-time career? I have graduated with a PhD from NUS. However, I am not interested in pursuing a career in academia. Additionally, during my PhD, I gradually lost all interest in the field that I was in (I was in BioMed engineering). I told myself, I am never going to do a job that is related to my PhD or biomedical, and started to think about changing career. During my PhD, I found out that one thing that interests me is trading stocks. Hence, after I graduated with my PhD from NUS, I started exploring trading as a career, using a part of my saving as the capital to trade. Although I have a few years of experiences with investing in stocks, when it comes to trading for an income, the difficulty level was much much higher. During the first year or so, my income was negative and I kept on losing money. It was a painful process. Especially when I see my friends who did not do PhD and have a regular office job drawing a fixed amount of money, sometimes 4 figures, every month. But I learnt from my lessons and understand what causes me to lose money. Now, I have consistent profit and have covered back the initial losses. I know of a few people who earn 6 figures a month from trading and I am confident I will join them one day. From my experience in trading, it is a job where you can earn much higher than many other regular jobs if you can overcome the initial stage of losing money (and are left with sufficient capital to trade). Additionally, the working hours are flexible and short (some traders only trade 15 minutes a day). The list of benefits goes on. Despite these benefits, however, I find that there are not many full-time traders. I am curious as to why is this so. I hypothesise that many people see trading in a negative light. Is this true? Could you share with me what do you think of a trading career?-#97736: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97736",27,5,0,0,3,21,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He is genuine and caring, and I really like him a lot in that sense. However, I realised that I am not entirely attracted to him in the physical sense.

#97733,17/4/2021,"As someone who has degrees in CS and Engineering, let me compare the 2 for those deciding which degree to pursue:Why CS > Engineering: - Better prep (training, internships, networking) for software jobs, which are typically much better paid and more comfortable than traditional engineering jobs. This disparity is only going to widen. - More prestigious (recently anyway). Also, you get to surround yourself with smarter people, which, over 4 years, makes a difference in your development. - Easier and more interesting curriculum (Sit in a chem eng year 4 lecture and you'll know what I mean) - More fun. I know this one is subjective but many CS students actually code for pleasure, often applying techniques they picked up in class. How many chem engineers calculate turbulent flow in their free time? - More career flexibility/ options: can build a startup/ freelance as a dev quite easily, or move to Thailand to be a digital nomad, if you're into that kind of thing. Try freelancing as a mech engineer. - Better use of time: being IT-literate will help you tremendously in your personal life anyway, why not pursue it academically/ professionally? Maybe being a civil engineer will come in handy when doing your home reno or something. - CS gives you a worldview and tools for thinking that can generalize well across domains (divide and conquer, abstraction, algorithmic thinking, complexity, learning from data), whereas traditional engineering tends to teach you narrower, domain-specific frameworks.Why Engineering > CS:None, honestly. Can't think of any disadvantages of CS that don't also apply to other technically rigorous courses such as Engineering and Math, esp in the SG context.-#97733: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97733",6,2,0,0,6,14,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0
#97732,17/4/2021,"My two cents on the new covid measures.Prior to the restrictions, restaurants and gyms were the few exceptions where individuals could remove their mask in a public space. Hence, the restriction on dining-in and the use of gyms are meant to curtail any opportunity for people to congregate in mask-less settings. However, it seems that a glaring omission remains - smokers. They are allowed (or encouraged) to congregate at smoking points to smoke, mask-off. The limited size of smoking points generally mean that social distancing of mask-less smokers is limited, because smoking outside of the demarcated area may result in fines. Why are smokers allowed this exception to the rule, to go mask-less in public? Unless clear scientific evidence is available to show that the consumption of cigarettes reduces the risk of covid transmission, this glaring omission should be circumscribed immediately. It hardly bodes well for smokers to be given such a liberty, when the majority of individuals who are non-smokers have willingly sacrificed their own liberty for social interactions in the name of protecting those around us from the risk of covid transmission. Hence, smokers should not be allowed to light up in public while covid measures are in place. Smokers should be reminded that on the bright side, such a measure will help to correspondingly reduce the strain on health infrastructure in the future for diseases such as lung or throat cancer.-#97732: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97732",0,1,0,0,3,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#97730,17/4/2021,"TL;DR, people should not behave with that holier than thou attitude over people who refuses to wear mask in public. Shouldn't dox others by digging out their past too.Since the start of this pandemic and the initiation of the requirement for everyone to wear a mask in public, there were some individuals who were caught markless in public. Some of these individuals even got aggressive towards the authorities and were rather stubborn over their beliefs regarding the donning of face mask in public.And of course, the reason why we were made known of such incidents were often due to someone else in public filming these people being caught in the act. Thereafter, these videos will be put up in a myriad of social media sites and may even be made into a meme for everyone to ridicule over.Yes, I do agree that such errant behaviour should not be condoned and the authorities should indeed take them to task. However, don't we find that the act of sensationalising these videos to be rather a rather low down behaviour too? Worse when there is some form of doxxing involved from digging up the past of these individuals and to make them a talking point over their behaviour.Just like the recent case of that lady who was caught maskless by the Safe Distancing Ambassadors and in turned questioned the authorities. Is it necessary to dig her past and go around plastering her days in the Navy? What's worse is when some commenters of these post went about equating her days in the Navy with her unruly behaviour. Our veterans are human being too and they are also entitled to their own opinions and beliefs. If it so happened that their behaviour is against the law, we should just let the authorities handle them. The act of judging an individual based on their past will achieve nothing but make you not much better as a person too.To think about it, these people who went about doxxing others are not much of a saint either. To these people, are you confident to tell the world that you are indeed following the rules strictly and is straight as an arrow? I don't think so. Nobody is perfect.I had often seen lots of people wearing their mask like chin straps or to wear one and to not cover their nose in public either. So I don't think anybody should go about sensationalising such cases of individuals who breached the mask wearing rule.-#97730: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97730",3,1,0,0,2,10,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
#97728,17/4/2021,"The view from a hospital pharmacy counterMy recent encounter with Mr LSF whose transplanted kidney, has started to fail again after 20 years, left me thinking. Of the sense of loss. Not long ago, perhaps five, six years back, this jolly sixty- plus- year- old man, became a regular at our pharmacy. For reasons unclear, he tended to linger at my counter, chit-chatting me up. To be frank, having to give out medications to so many people a day, I usually remember the medications they have more than the people they are. But this man lingered on so long, for so numerous the occasions, sharing his kidney transplant story, how proud he was to maintain his fitness regime, recommending me the brands of toothpaste on the pharmacy floor, I was not sure whether to feel flattered because it was me, he targeted those conversations on, or irritable (common sir, these are too long-winded to be exchanges between strangers on the train, or on the hospital pharmacy counter, for that matter. And there are the next patients behind, always …)His manners were impeccable, his good intention often shone through, so there were no reasons to be rude. I, though feeling slightly unease, politely listened through his lengthy convos on mundane matters like his love for crab cuisine, his recent cruise to somewhere etc, while trying to think of ways to direct his attention to the fuming red patients standing behind him. (They looked as if I were committing an indecency by lending an ear to him. They were longing for me to stop)Fast forward to today, I saw his script, his name on it, but instead of him, his wife and son came forward  collecting his medications. His condition must have taken a turn for a worse, to have BOTH the son and the wife accompanying this visit. True enough, the notes said his transplanted kidney was failing, he was back to peritoneal dialysis and was going to be admitted for a myriad of infections. It brought me back to that amorphous feeling, an uncategorized sense of loss, of the grief that is to come. Not a personal loss as he and I were not related, but dismal enough to put me in a melancholic mood for the day because he was a familiar face.How many more years, months he has, I wonder?After the death of another patient, a year ago, I had for some time experience a most vivid feeling of loss, a spot of bother that lasted surprisingly longer that I had expected. Mrs C was a perennial fixture in the pharmacy, for she came by every 2 months, an amputee in wheelchairs, to collect her bags and bags of medications and dressings, and morphine tablets and bottles of morphine syrups - the highlight of her every visit.She belonged to the categories of anxious people, who existed before immaterial time, had somehow got hold of my supervisor’s number and requested for her medicine to be prepared before arrival. This process was neither right nor was it our standard procedure, but her suffering must have felt so immense, and her irritation so palpable, we all scuttled to do her biddings every time she came. Definitely not out of fear, perhaps out of pity, I think? More certainly, it was perhaps because she was a regular - one that we thought belonged to the vampire caste, feasted on the opioid craze and would last forever till eternity.   After some time, I didn’t know why but she preferred me (apart from my soft-hearted boss, that one was definitely her favourite) to dispense medications to her. She usually asked me how I was, if have I eaten etc, questions that I classified under diatribes that didn’t merit a counter enquiry and proper response. I, again, usually just listened and nodded, out of politeness (and at any rate, I was exhausted with the crowd, making small talks was never my forte).The last time we talked she commented on how exhausted I looked. I chuckled as usual, and went on to explain about the change in the morphine syrup formulation we were giving her that day. Two weeks later, I heard news of her passing… A life extinguished.For me, it must be a very terrible thing, to see so much and to feel so deeply.Amid all the merry-making, pleasure-seeking, asset-accumulating life processes, when you are engrossed, so engrossed that you have no sense of proportion, no sense of awareness - of your cosmic unimportance, a life unfolding before your eyes suddenly interrupted, a door slammed in your face, a bold reminder “So this is what life’s really like.

I am not sure whether I want to marry him, because I don't know what is considered as ""husband material"" or a ""suitable pick"". Following your suggestions, I have informed my bf regarding my concerns of getting married/discussing about marriage so early (I'm 21 years old). For those that are asking me to complete my education, I am currently studying for my degree while my bf is working in a job where he does not see himself working in that industry for the next 5 years, and did not like the course he took in poly. So in terms of finance, it's a bit on the rocky side. I need some advice on what do you consider as a good husband, or some green flags in a relationship. I had bad relationships previously and learnt from my mistakes, and I certainly do not want anything bad for this.

#97713,17/4/2021,"My friend seems to be strung along by a guy she had a crush on since long ago. They have been together for about half a year and she was the one who asked him out,the situation sounds real similar to a post made earlier on .The guy in question never seemed to have plans for their future and always finds some sort of excuse to divert the question whenever long term commitment is being talked about.They would get into fights due to this, but the guy would always manage to sweet talk her back. He would not treat her very nicely, but would always seem to have changed for the better, only to revert back to a heck care attitude once things have stabled down again .My friend probably has a gut feeling that he is not serious about her and would frequently question herself and feel alone and burnt out from trying to maintain the relationship. Having trust issues, not seeing the result she wants But after everything, she seem to feel that he loves her , how he connects well with her etc and she would be giving him gifts and so on to keep him around. She had spent thousands on this particular guy over a span of around half a year. As an outsider, it is very obvious that she is being strung around and getting used. I have met the guy in question, and he gives off the feeling that he just wants to enjoy the moment but not have long term commitments. He is quite well spoken and seem to know how to sweet talk/ small talk , he works in a job that requires him to be able to teach or talk to people. I suppose he needs to keep up his looks and talk well for his ricebowl and my friend just got smitten. Our clique and even her parents confronted her about this, trying to help her see the truth that he is exploiting her affections for his own gains ,but she would find excuses to justify everything.Excuses that are borderline crazyTo the point where she had a fight with her parents and shut out everybody who tried to help. She had lost many friends, quit hobbies and fully became a housefly that flies around that guy.Is there anyway to wake her up from her daydream and see the truth?It sucks to see her suffer everytime those fights happen and she pretty much compromises and do things to make the guy stay and the guy just needs to put up an act and accept the ""apology"".

I mean it's his money I can't control who he lend to right. But it actually hurts me so much because the fact that he hide it from me. The reason I'm so frustrated is because that friend of his is not even his close friends??? And is someone I have never heard of, after all these years together with him. His reason of hiding - Scared I will nag at him for lending his friend money. His friend is a female and I think he is afraid I will be jealous. I have my fair share to be jealous tbh. He never even spend that much on me before and yet he lend this money to his friend without much thought??? It's not like as if he is super rich or what, all this is his hard earned money. I understand that his friend is in a bad financial situation, and he really lend out of good will. But why make it so shady by hiding from me? I emphasized so much in this relationship that I want everything to be transparent. This is not the first time he ""choose not to tell me"" cause he don't want me to nag or scared I will be jealous. HELLO but when I found out the truth, it just hurts so much. I'm not willing to let go of this relationship because it's not like as if there's a third party's involvement. But I'm not sure how should I approach this if something similar happened again. To me it is a deal breaker, because very often hiding leads to lying, and lying will eventually leads to deceiving. I do not want our relationship to be toxic by constantly paranoid over him lying to me. I trust him so much but right now my trust to him is never the same again.

#97702,17/4/2021,"Hi admin please don't filter this out. Really need to get this off somewhereim 20/F and my bf is 22 in the army. He recently graduated as a sergeant? We have been together for about 7 months and we met through tinder. He is to me perfect and always give in to me whatever the circumstances is. In fact i feel guilty being with him as he has always treat me with so much love while on the other hand, i always show him attitude. However to be honest, in the first place, we are 2 very different people leading different life. Firstly, I'm a Christian while he is not. I tried to ask him to attend church service with me over the weekend when he book out but he has never been interested to attend. Only once did he attend and that was only because i was going to be at church the whole day.Secondly, i'm in NUS while he doesn't have any uni placing at the moment as he did not do too well in poly. Till now, he still doesn't know what he wants to do in future and that worries me.Also, i feel like we don't get to spend much time together. Throughout this 7 months, i'm only able to see him only during the weekends. Sometimes we get to spend the whole weekend together and at times we spent only a few hours together. I really love him but it just sucks so much to wait for 1 whole week just to spend so little time and every time he books in, the same whole cycle repeats itself. its really frustrating. Sometimes when he is free, he will ask to go out with his friends or army mates. I feel like we are already spending so little time together as a couple, why does he still want to meet them just to drink or whatever. Furthermore, idk why is he always feeling tired. It's like he gets to sleep in camp after training but whenever he books out, he still complains that he is tired.While i really love my bf, i really dk is he the one for me given that even at this relatively early stage, we already have so much differences. After speaking to my parents, they advised me not to date during this period while im studying as he will be  a distraction. To add on, i recently met this guy who is my senior in NUS and is about to graduate with good grades. We have been talking to each other and in general i feel that he is someone more compatible with me then my current bf who can't even decide what he wants to do in the future and is still in the army.

#97697,17/4/2021,"This might come off as being an asshole but...I have been with my current girlfriend for very long. I am kind of a reserved guy (but kinda talkative when we're close), so when I picked up the courage to confess to my girlfriend >5 years ago, I was shocked that she agreed to be an item. Fast-forward to the present, we're comfortable with each other. We leave time for each other, talk to each other on a daily basis, celebrate occasions etc. We've always talked about settling down in the future (about marrying and getting a house, children), and now that it creeps ever so slowly closer, I have been having dreams about not committing. What I mean by not committing is not cheating. I have never been in serious contact with another girl ever since we got together, just during projects and stuff. My girlfriend and I have pretty different personalities and ideologies. She is less structured in life and likes social media drama, gossip etc. I do still listen to her and try to understand what's going on but they are not my interests. My interests are in world affairs (ethics, politics), or like hypothetical made up situations (idk one random example would be like the ethics of a panopticon, and understanding other's perspectives, one of the reasons why I like to read books). We do talk about my interests sometimes, but not at the depth I'd like. You can say that they are just dreams, but they have been coming over and over, over a period of a few months and its seriously bringing me closer to a mental breakdown. These dreams are me with another girl (the girl changes in these dreams. Sometimes its a primary school friend, sometimes its a secondary school friend. Both of whom I have not kept in contact with.) The dreams are nothing fancy, but rather just me just chatting with them. But whenever I wake up, I start to doubt my relationship. I cherish this relationship. We've been through ups and downs, but if I were to marry her and get bored of each other due to the differences being too much, I'd honestly stop wasting her time. I'd rather be alone than keep her in this relationship.-#97697: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97697",25,6,0,0,0,23,0,8,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#97696,17/4/2021,"There is always someone who go down the slippery slope of “biological differences” to justify unequal gender obligations. In any case, barring elite military branches such as commandos, most girls of average physique should be able to serve reasonably well. You don’t need superhuman strength to hold a rifle and shoot someone. Ask Israel etc., they tried and its possible. (and the reason why females are not put in combat roles are NOT due to “genetics”)If you argue based on “biological differences”, that the natural sexual dimorphism has significant bearing on suitability to do certain jobs (in this case, NS vocations as “jobs”), justifying why women should not go into armed forces, then do you realise what it also means? It is well known scientifically that sexual dimorphism does not stop at physique. Male and females’ brains are different too. In terms of behaviour, sexual dimorphism exists also. If “biological differences” are that pronounced that we could excuse females from NS, does not mean that there are well paid prestigious male dominated careers that females are simply “genetically unsuitable” (based on the same slippery slope logic)?How coincidental that “biological differences” only applies to things that females dislike? And when they dislike NS for reasons such as “its too tough”, does that not reinforce the societal expectations of women, the same thing that feminists are so eager to abolish in areas that suit them? It’s hypocritical to hide behind “biological differences” to escape from obligations that no one likes, but at the same time, denouncing it when justifying for minority quota or other privileges to access beneficial career opportunities.-#97696: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97696",5,2,0,0,2,14,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

#97683,17/4/2021,"Coming to the issue of girls serving NS, I would like to share my thoughts on this.Firstly people might argue that girls are biologically different and might not be able to handle the physical hardships in the tough environment. No doubt this may be true to certain extent, but I will say that it only holds for some girls. Why do I say that? Reason being, there are girls out there who are fit enough to lift weights, so carrying a weapon might not be of any difficulty to them, not even running since there are many fitspo gals out there who can run as fast as guys. (East Coast Park etc) These are in fact the girls who should join the combat unit.Another reason is that the girls in our generation are growing taller beyond 170cm. Before I get flamed on this, allow me to point out that being tall has always been a symbol of masculinity for guys. Since there is this gender equality thing, it should hold for the tall ladies as well who can be perceived as strong Amazons, doing their part to contribute to the nation.(The reason why I claim this is I myself is 170cm tall as well and I do observe my surroudings and there are many girls at my eye level so they should be around this height.) Instead of eat drink and making merry in shopping centres or restaurants, they should do their part to help guys out in NS and not waste the vertical space on this small tiny dot.Coupled with the fact that we are facing an ageing population with large no. of boomers, we need even more manpower to boost our defence capabilities especially from the younger generation where tall ladies can play their part.Some xenophobic people may ask why not the foreigners serve NS? Well the reason is simple. Your own country you protect yourself. They have already done their part to boost the economy, otherwise we wouldnt have the luxury of enjoying today.So it is not just guys who should serve, it should in fact be made mandatory for tall or fit girls to serve as well to prove their worth. Short girls are excused. Sorry.-#97683: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97683",29,5,0,0,18,19,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'd understand and will always give him space, and ask to talk it out again when everything is a little more settled down? but i'll always find that he will blame me for being overly sensitive and that he cant use his words freely just cause im butt hurt.. i feel like i can never get annoyed at something he does cause he will in turn, be annoyed at me for being annoyed at him.. i really enjoy my time with him, we laugh at the stupidest thing but just whenever quarrel happens, i get so mentally exhausted.. you guys would ask me to talk it out with him.. and yes we did talk about it quite a few times, but we are always back to square 1.. im just getting tired to the point i'd rather not hamg out with him, just in case we will get into a quarrel.. this is my first relationship and i dont know how deal with it.. should i break this up? but idw to break up.. but its 5yrs long, he met my parents, i met his.. i just dk what to do.. please help-#97672: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97672",24,7,0,1,0,11,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#97671,17/4/2021,"TLDR: Busy gf, bf doesn't seem to understand, how?My bf and I have very different educational background, he currently doesn't have a job and is still in search of one, while I've been working for a while already, in an agency. :"") If you're in the marketing/advertising/media industry you'll understand how tiring it is and how work-life balance is really difficult to manage when you work in agencies. On top of my day job, I have my own side-hustle, and on top of that, I'm constantly upgrading myself by signing up for courses, which means any time I get out of my usual working hours (I OT quite a bit) is used up. I try my best to accommodate to him and meet him as often as I can, I still meet him 2-3 times a week, at least for dinner, or stay over at his place, but it's really tiring for me, because to me, his home is not my home, his bed is not my bed, and it makes a difference. I don't even have much time to spend on my own, relaxing and doing things I enjoy, and yet if I choose to not spend an extra day with him, he gets upset and tries to think of ways to get me to meet him or stay over. I'm working hard because this career path is something I really wanted, I still have a huge uni debt to pay off, and my pay isn't enough to help me pay it off quickly, so I do freelance on the side to finance my loans as well, I take on courses because I believe they will help me gain an advantage when my bosses consider employees for a promotion, or maybe these skills and knowledge can help me get a higher pay.  Sometimes I just wish to have one entire week to myself to rest but when I bring it up, my bf gets upset. I have my own family, we're not married yet but he doesn't seem to understand that my family will get upset if I keep spending so much time away. I have no idea how to tell him this nicely and get him to understand, we've fought over this multiple times but every single time, because I don't dare and don't know how to put it across, I end up giving in and squeezing time out for him again, sacrificing my rest and all. I go home late on weekdays just because he wants to spend more time together, and then I end up having to take a cab to work the next day because I didn't get enough sleep and I can't wake up in time. Aside from this, he is a very caring and loving bf, he takes care of me, is super loyal and devoted, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, only plays games with me, doesn't look at girls, don't follow female influencers, he is like the nicest guy ever, just that he's super clingy and just can't seem to be away from me.

Actually I always wanted to keep myself busy because I have no partner to spend my time with, friends, I started to feel distanced away. So. yes I met someone I valued as important, but he doesnt really value much of my existence. He never initiated much outing with him, but days when I am busy, I felt guilty not having the time for him, or put in it another way, I want to see him although I am busy and tired. I truly understand how it feel and what people meant when they say no matter how busy a person can be, he/she will still make time for the important one. So, I actually didnt know what I need to do. I had too much of a ""down"" with him , but as he being an important one, even if there is one ""up"" moment, it seem to fade all the ""down"" moment. I am not important to him, so each time when we have good times together ( I enjoyed myself always), I often ask myself, is this our end. Should I end this ""relationship"" with him. Am I already satisfied with some ""memories"" with him? Each time I asked myself, maybe, maybe I can stop thinking of ending and just enjoy every little moment. But being an emotional person, I dont think I can stop thinking, when will this feeling of ""up and down"" end, because it is very exhausting. And so, I am really busy with work lately, although works had really started to drain me, and start to fade my smile, my cheerful self, it can make me move on from him, unknowningly.

#97656,17/4/2021,"When I first entered uni, I became fast friends with a girl in my course since we attended orientation together. We were both attached back then and our partners are in other unis. This girl and I have the same group of friends, so no surprise we hang out with each other a lot. My then girlfriend felt suspicious that I was always texting her and going out with my uni friends when I’ve always been someone who rather stay at home. It was then I realised that I developed feelings for my friend. On her part, she was constantly breaking up and getting back together with her boyfriend, and often relied on me for support during these hard times. Eventually, her boyfriend became aware of me and maybe at some point of time, I could have been the reason for their on and off relationship. I distanced myself from her which resulted in a lot of conflict between us, but I was determined to make things work between my then girlfriend and I. Ultimately, the hurt I caused my then girlfriend was too much and she ended things with me after 4 years together. The guilt I felt towards my then girlfriend was overwhelming, I would cry every time I think about what I put her through. It took me about 2 years before I could stop hating myself. Throughout these 2 years, as I was single, I managed to mend my friendship with this girl. While I continued to provide her with support when she needs me, I also reminded myself that she is still attached. We mostly meet to attend classes, eat meals, or study together. We hang out outside of uni probably once a month at best. There were times where this girl tells me to go and date, but honestly, I fear that I would put through another girl the same pain I put my ex through. It took me so long to be comfortable enough to share my mistake without breaking down, and to be honest, I don’t actually think I forgive myself. Anyway, last year, this girl broke up with her boyfriend for good. The dynamic between us never changed until recently, where we started hanging out outside of uni on a weekly basis. A part of me feels that I don’t want to give up on her after all the shit we’ve been through, hence why I stayed by her side all these while. Maybe all these while, I’ve been waiting for her, but I deny that to myself. But there were times where I look at her and I feel that we are not compatible and it’s impossible for us to be together. I’m not entirely sure. Though I’ve never said it explicitly, I’m sure she’s well aware that I am interested in her. I have asked her before if she was looking to date, months after breaking up. She replied that she would like to stay single because she’s not ready for a relationship. My friends say that she’s only making use of me for the attention because if she really likes me, she would have left her ex boyfriend long ago for me. On top of that, they say that that’s a common excuse given to hint that girls give when they are not interested. So now I’m second guessing the reason for her meeting me every week. Could it be because she’s single now and seek validation, or perhaps she’s interested in me? I honestly don’t know what to do with this entire situation. It’s been years and I feel like I never got to see the end of it.-#97656: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97656",10,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I tried to hate him, for his actions hurt me a lot but then I couldn’t. I still thought the best of him. I preached about wanting to just stay single and that I am not suited for a relationship which in turn saw me turning down a few guys and escaping from situations when the other party tries to go deep or take things up a notch. There’s still so much I want to know about him and for him to find out about me but at the same time doubting what could possibly happen or re-live the same ghosting incident. I guess it's better to lie low, reminiscing silently and hope to forget him than to chat him up only to waste each other’s' time and risk getting hurt again. Right?

Professor Ben, would like to get your insights as well, as you seem to be someone who knows his stuff. Please don't laugh, but I want to work for the ministry of foreign affairs, ideally as an ambassador or somewhere along those lines. As of now, I have two potential routes I could take, but I'm not sure which is better. Option A: Sign on to SAF after uni (or another uniform group) and after about 10-15 years of service, retire and get my foot into the government service door. This may sound like a stupid idea to most, but the idea of military service and protecting one's country has always appealed to me, and I would be willing to undergo all the xiong training just to reach my end goal. If any ex-regulars (doesn't matter which org.) can give some insight into post-service employment especially in the government sector, would be great. Option B: Try (and potentially fail) to get MFA midterm scholarship while in uni, which will inevitably secure me a bond with MFA post graduation. This might seem like the obvious choice, but what is the career progression like for this option, compared to the first? Also, is Option A a viable (and the best) way to go in the case Option B fails?Apologies for the long read, and I know it's a stupid dream, but it's my dream.-#97645: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97645",8,0,0,1,0,8,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

She doesnt rly make me feel loved, i receive the most dry ""gd morning"" text from her, it doesnt seem like she is excited to spend time with me too and never once gave me any reassurance, especially since she hangs out with alot of guys and even go out 1 on 1 afew times, and im not talking about sweet text(which NEVER happened ONCE throughout the time we dated). She also wears shirts that belongs to other guys which i personally feel is unacceptable( i wld understand if it was a new shirt given as a gift). She's lowkey a gold digger also because i realise i always end up spending at least half of whatever money i have each month on her. And while im taking time to heal now she's going ard seeking affirmation from other guys trying to fill the void i left which is kind of toxic in my opinion. That doesnt bother me though because her next relationship wont end up lasting seeing how she treats the whole situation and she'll probably end up continuously filling that void till she finally wakes up and realise her own mistakes. At least i get to laugh at her glow down while i have my glow up and watch my bank account grow and eventually find someone else to give the world to and spend my money on. And if she sees this i hope she'll realise that it is her loss because someone who she once complained about being poor is now 10 times richer and she lost someone that would do anything for her while all i lost was someone who couldnt give me the simplest words of affirmation. You may think u got the better end of the breakup but deep down you know u've messed up;)-#97636: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97636",10,2,0,0,2,13,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

Although I would not say that I am particularly religious as I never really believed in Buddhism/ a particular religion but I do go to temples etc due to my parents’ beliefs.

I enjoy learning more about God and reading the Bible yet I am also hesitant to let my parents know that I am going to cell sessions as I feel like it’s going against them/they will be very unsupportive of it.

To me, it feels like if a girl drives then I would feel a status less than that compared to the girl and would be intimidated when dating her. I do not drive because I do not see a need in my current lifestyle.2. Is the salary of how much he earns an important consideration?

#97630,17/4/2021,"I am having an upsetting issue with my marriage and I wish just to have a discussion with helpful commenters here.I am married to a woman whose older brother has inherited their parents' business. Let's just say he makes a shitload of money and I don't know how much he earns. He lives in a landed detached near Nanyang Primary School. It's worth mentioning that that company is split 90/10 between my brother-in-law and his mother. My father-in-law is dead, never met the guy. My wife got a 3-bed condo from her dad. We live in it now.My wife is a housewife. She became a housewife ever since we had our first child. Now we have 2 children, aged 5 and 2. I don't make a lot of money (I'm a civil servant), and my wife is uniquely high maintenance. Although I would be lying if I didn't also say that she has changed a lot since we met in uni. In those days, she would walk into ION, spend a couple thousand dollars in a few hours, and call it ""therapeutic."" I made it very clear to her when we were dating, repeatedly I might add, that I am low SES and she was the one who agreed to still go out with me, eventually agreeing to marry me. Recently, because of the stress of raising my two children, she has started to ask for significantly more money to spend. She started going back to cafes with her friends at Orchard, something she has stopped doing for a long time, and she has started buying branded stuff. The cost of raising children has also been more expensive than I had predicted. But to be completely honest, if I reduce my savings to negligible numbers, I can support both my wife's lifestyle and all the household expenses. I don't make a lot but I think I am comfortably middle-income. The thing is I want to save up for retirement. I think it is my responsibility to save up for retirement because I do not believe in asking anything from my children. So for a few months, I have told my wife that I have not enough money to give her apart from what I usually give her. We didn't use to fight. But we have fought more in the past 6 months than our entire history together combined.I think 2-3 months ago, she started having money to spend all of a sudden. She could buy all her branded stuff, go to cafes etc. A few weeks ago, we went to Takashimaya and my son saw this $500 toy that he really wanted. I obviously told him no. I didn't have the budget for it. He threw a tantrum and I held my ground, as I have always done. Without hesitation, my wife just came over and told him ""daddy doesn't have money, mummy buy for you."" I got so angry I just drove home, leaving them all behind.Two days ago, I finally found out my wife has been getting money from my brother-in-law. I found out by accident because she left her iBanking session active when she was cooking. In that past 5 months alone, my brother-in-law sent her $20,000 a month. Ok, let's just get something straight here. I don't have a good relationship with my BIL. He is really smart and really rich. Because I always feel very insecure about how smart I am, I always try to sound smart during family dinners. But he frankly just knows so much about so many things once he starts talking everyone just listens to him explain shit. It is frustrating and I really don't like being around him. So I can't talk to him about leaving my family business to me because I'm sure he would just say it's his money and he can give it whomever he wants.I talked to my wife about the money she's been receiving, and how we should review our household finances and she was adamant in saying that the money her brother sent to her is ""her brother's money,"" earmarked for ""her to spend"" and I'm not allowed to have a discussion on how it constitutes an increase in our household income.I'm not angry at the money that she's been getting. I'm just upset that I get the sense that my wife has lost all respect for the kind of money I make, the type of work that I do, and the person I am. For example, she'd suggest a place to have dinner, like a really expensive place, and I stopped being able to use the excuse that we cannot afford it because she'd say it's her treat. I feel like nobody respects me in the family and I don't even know what to feel anymore.-#97630: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97630",131,42,0,49,0,77,0,75,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
#97624,17/4/2021,"Should people who have spent too long in the SAF be considered good candidates to be leaders of private sector corporations?I spent quite some time in two highly profitable American corporations, where the spirit of constructive defiance of authority has been prized. Company executives have developed a culture of asking for opinions from the most junior employees in a meeting, so that fresh ideas can be thrown out and debated on in a sort of safe space. Project managers are also given ample room to test out their own solutions. Even though they risk being fired if they do a bad job of it, if their solutions work, they are rewarded handsomely. Here's the thing, even though the leaders know of the risk that project managers will do a bad job, for the most part, they create an environment that ensure merit, true merit, gets discovered. The SAF has a way of doing things, but the way the SAF does things is almost completely contrary to how a profitable corporation should do things. I have heard ex-SAF generals being lauded by party leaders for having led organizations of many people, which makes them qualified to lead large organizations in any industry. But it does not constitute a skill to be put in a position where your followers are 100% obligate followers. In addition, SAF is an organization that does not have to be profitable. Thus, very few things are mission critical. When the chief does something wrong, especially in a country like Singapore, the consequences are far less severe compared to when the CEO of Intel makes a wrong move. That's why it is dangerous for such corporations to give too rely too much on the discretion of their decision-makers, and strongman decision-makers are rarely preferred.I move to keep anyone who has ever been a regular in the SAF out of any for-profit organizations entirely. We have seen what these people can do to NOL, SMRT, I honestly don't want to see it happening to SIA, SingTel, or DBS.-#97624: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97624",14,11,0,0,12,72,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
#97623,17/4/2021,"Guy A and Girl B have been dating for 2 years. Recently, Guy A told Girl B that he feels that she is being self-absorbed and does not take care of him. Example he gave: he was busy with work and was sick (not infectious kind) but he still went ahead to meet up with his friends (for his dog’s socialization gathering). Yet he told her he didn’t have time to meet her. Girl B was upset about it and threw a fuss. In the past, Guy A would comfort her and make things better but now Guy A said he’s tired and does not want to have to deal with her emotional outburst. Guy A used to call every day after work if they can’t meet. But recently, Guy A stopped doing it after he said he feels she is self absorbed.Guy A accompanies Girl B for medical appointments, help her with her work woes, give advice on family drama (would stay up till 4am to hear her out if she has any issues), cooks for her or sends her food (but not every day - like once in awhile). But Girl B feels that he should be doing these things anyways and it’s his responsibility as a boyfriend so i he’s actually going above and beyond to be a good boyfriend. These are baseline expectations. He said that this shows her self-entitled mentality and he’s not sure of a future because (1) self-absorbed, (2) self-entitled, and (3) he wants to feel taken care of as well. Girl B disagrees that she is self-absorbed or self-entitled though she acknowledges that she may not be very good at taking care of him.He said that women are into equality these days (similar to what a previous poster wrote) yet women don’t step up and look after the guys. Instead, they want to be pampered (nothing wrong with that) just that they need to not be double standards about it.

#97621,17/4/2021,"Admin….hope you can don’t filter this…..because I need some answers.TLDR: I just don’t understand how I always seem to piss my guy friends off. And it always happen with the ones whom I’m closer with. Like for Guy A, we gotten really close; close as in will chat ABIT(maybe 10 msgs) almost everyday, will meet in GROUPS(got girls/guys) every week or every fortnight. But we almost never meet alone because I had promised my SO that I will try to avoid meeting guy friends alone in order to avoid misunderstandings. I’m happily married and everyone knows that. With my guy friends, we are also always prim and proper – no touchy touchy, no hold hands, don’t lean on each other, basically no skin-ship. After meet-ups, I also go home myself instead of letting them fetch me home. I always pay my own share too. I also call them by proper names, not “bii”, not “dear” and definitely nothing like “miss you” that sorta msgs. Guy A tends to ask me where I’m going on weekends and I usually don’t hide anyway. And gradually it became a habit for him to ask me where I’m going, doing what and meeting who. As we are good friends, I will just answer, for e.g, I will say I’m meeting my colleagues to drink, etc. Sometimes, when some messages are just before bed time, generally we will “good night” each other. Once, I didn’t reply his question on whether I’ve reached home after drinks, the next day he threw tantrum at me. I was shocked but I explained nicely I’m merely too tired. Things were back to normal but slowly, it became a daily routine which I grew abit tired of. So 1 day I told him why it’s like I’m reporting to him and I told him I’m not a kid. I was finally fed up and told him I’m just going to stop the daily “reached home” and “good night” reporting. Then he broke down and cried, saying he’s just worried about me as they are guys around who drinks. I felt bad and apologized… Sigh….then somehow more and more things popped up where he will get angry with me. I’m the kind who “eat soft don’t eat hard”, so whenever he’s fierce with me, I will argue back. But whenever when I’m too harsh then he will…be sad and affected. I will again get soft-hearted and pacify him again. It’s such a vicious cycle that I’m getting crazy.Then there is Guy B whom I’m also close with; our closeness is quite the same as Guy A – meet in groups quite frequently, hardly meet alone, prim and proper, but we hardly chat with messages. But the difference he has with Guy A is he has very strong pride. Which means our arguments can get very heated. But I really don’t understand why does he gets angry with me so easily either? There was once where I bailed out of a group meet up because I was too tired, he got angry with me. I’m so sure if it’s the other guys, he will definitely not mind at all because it happened before. He threw a fit by messaging me a few whatsapp pages until I had to make a trip down. There was another time where he also threw tantrum at me by scolding me via whatsapp continuously for an hr just because I sided with another guy friend in a game of cards. Sometimes I see other girls drop mild sarcastic jokes in jest, he can laugh and refute back but if it’s me, it’s as if volcano erupts. What the hell man…..Everytime we quarrelled about these minor stupid stuffs(everytime is him getting angry), sometimes he apologized, sometimes he doesn’t. THEN, it became so bizarre that he tried various ways to get me angry or hurt me by hurling really mean and condescending remarks infront of all our friends. I have generally a good temper(or rather, I’m just very bo-chup) but even so, I’m getting kind of exasperated through time! It's getting kinda ridiculous when he started to say things he don't mean, like ""I don't wanna see you!"" but still continues to ask me out. Sometimes I really dont know what he wants. I don’t really apologize to Guy B since he’s always malicious while scolding me, unlike Guy A who somehow explained his actions are for my own good and that I’ve hurt him etc. Since I've typed so much, then might as well! There’s also something which I don’t understand. There’s a Guy C whom suddenly out of nowhere said “You don’t matter to me at all” in a flat, normal tone kinda voice when he was intoxicated. I was stunned, said nothing but I was thinking like “What?!”. I’m thinking he must be drunk so I also didn’t say anything much. But it happened again on another group outing where he said again “You are not important to me at all”. Seriously??!! ,=)’’’ It’s so bizarre as I thought we have always been okay friends and he is usually very nice. Oh Common…. I know I’m not important nor matter to him but really necessary to say right to my face meh……it’s so embarrassing, and kinda hurting too.Why I have a feeling Guy B and Guy C just want to make me feel bad when I didn't really offend them at all........So what’s wrong? Anything wrong with me? Like why all this kept happening? I’ve consulted my female friends before and most of them generally asked me to give up the friendship to spare myself of all the frustration – there is that, but I just wish to know where’s the problem, else it’s going to happen again whenever I get close to a guy friend. To me, guy friends and girl friends are both equally important and the same to me. Is there any way to stop all this? How to…make guys stop…how to say….. – they seemed to take my words/opinions/presence abit too seriously or I will just somehow unknowingly piss them off whatsoever. Geez….I have so much phobia now until I dare not talk too much to other guy friends in case we get too close and such things happen again. I’m usually a happy-go-lucky and sunshine kinda girl. -#97621: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97621",37,1,0,4,10,12,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

#97617,17/4/2021,"My bf and I have been tgt for close to a year now. Both of us are working shifts so it’s quite flexible to meet up a few times in a week. I do see a future with him but there’s some issues that’s bothering me and I’m not sure if this would pose a problem in the future. I’m a person that has my phone with or beside me all the time n would reply almost immediately. One thing that bothers me is that whenever he has free time n we are chatting, suddenly out of nowhere he would just disappear. And the next thing I see is he’s online on FB. For the next few mins there will be no replies, then finally some messages n gone again. Whereas for me if I’m on phone or doing some other things, if his messages come I’ll immediately open. Is this a matter of prioritising or idk how to put it. I understand that during work there will be busy times, but when you’re finally free or have breaks, don’t u wna squeeze in abit to text your SO n chat abit? This happened many times n often I tell myself to just close one eye n do my stuffs, if he replies then so be it. Another thing is his family. His family is generally quite nice to me, never felt so welcoming before. The issue is about money, where they would sometimes borrow from him and till date none is returned back. Y’all may think like since it’s family, don’t have to be so calculative. Small amounts maybe forget it, but imagine lump sum like 4 digits? It’s his hard earned bonus money, and gone like a snap. I don’t see a chance of it being returned altho they promised to because it’s such a large amount. He don’t earn a lot also, and still gives allowance, leaving a tiny bit to the savings. Im not sure if this will be an issue in the future because money is impt and we have to think about housing.

#97615,17/4/2021,"To the OP of #97608, I feel that communication might be an issue between you and your girlfriend. My girlfriend of 3 years is quite similar to your girlfriend too, but to be honest neither do I see myself being replaced by a dog, nor thinking that she is being overly nice to her dog. She used to have a Labrador, but after it passed, she is now having a corgi too, and since it’s small, she can easily bring her everywhere, and this is where my concern comes in.I believe everyone views things differently. Some people may think that feeding your dog with average meal, bath your dog regularly, walk your dog on a daily basis, all these are sufficient to be a good dog owner, but some people take this to the next level by treating their dogs with kibbles, pricey food, baby pram, dog clothes, monthly grooming, which really incur shitload more money. Basically the OP has nothing against his girlfriend’s dog, but rather has concern on her spending that makes it difficult for them to settle down by buying house, getting married, etc.Frankly speaking I feel that bringing your dog out to nice places once in a while is fine, which is what my girlfriend does as well, but if she does it so often, together with the large amount of money incurred that actually affect your relationship, then you should really talk to your girlfriend about it. My girlfriend used to be like yours, she brought our corgi everywhere, literally EVERYWHERE including hawker, marketplace, etc. I actually felt that she has overdone and misunderstood the meaning of love for your pet, so I told her about it and elaborated whatever that bothers me. Like sometimes I find it quite burdensome to bring him out because 1. We had to keep watching him to prevent him from acting aggressively out of a sudden or running away from us, 2. We had to find a pet-friendly or outdoor non-air-conditioned places to dine in, 3. Due to the fact that we can’t bring pets into shopping malls, our outings became café hopping, beach walking, sightseeing, and I could no longer enjoy walking in malls, 4. People beside our table tend to be more aware and away from us due to the fur. At some food courts, we’ve been confronted several times by people beside our table, telling us that our dog fur flew to their table. Some elderlies even yelled at us for dirtying the seat because we let our dog sit on the chair. I’ve also seen people requested to change table so that they can stay further away from us. I knew these are the consequences that I will faced, so I always tried to put a smile on my face and just apologized to them. However, I knew this really should stop, because relationship is about 2 parties, and it doesn’t make sense to me if my girlfriend enjoys frequently brings our dog out but I feel the burden and totally didn’t enjoy the outings at all. I eventually talked to her about it and we had several big fights, but now she understands my points and does it much less frequently as before. I’m not sure how your girlfriend spends her money, but my girlfriend doesn’t compromise our savings, because she doesn’t mind cutting down expenses on her food, cosmetics, entertainment, so I’m perfectly fine with that. Some corgi/dog lover may disagree with how I treat our dog, or I shouldn’t feel the burden if I really love my dog, but that’s your fxxking problem, and I wholeheartedly admit I love our dog, and I walk my dog every single day, I make sure he is well-fed, I make sure I play with him whenever I can, I do what I feel is right to love my dog, just not up to your expectations. Just because I don’t spoil my dog as much as you “dog lovers” do, it doesn’t mean I don’t love my dog. It’s like buying your kids PS4, LV wallet, ipad pro, supreme clothes, yeezy shoes, just so that your kids will be happy, but not everyone can afford such luxuries.

#97611,17/4/2021,"How often do couples go on dates in a week?My bf and I have been together for 8 months now, we met via a dating app and things progressed from there. In our initial days, we agreed to meet just once a week due to school commitments and wanting to give one another enough time to spend with our own separate groups of family and friends. However, now when we are no longer have school commitments and have both started working; have more cash and time to spare for one another, he still insists on meeting just once a week, and only meeting twice a week in the event of emergencies or as a 'make up' for not meeting up on another week. I feel that our relationship is very organised. On every date we went for, we would also plan ahead for the activities and food to eat on our next date. While I have asked him to meet up twice a week occasionally (not every week, perhaps once a month or once every 2 weeks) with the extra date just spending some time together for dinner instead of spending long hours together. He declined, saying that he would have no time for his family or friends if he were to do so. While he mentioned that we could meet twice a week when there's an emergency such as when I needed him over to help with something, there's always a reason for him not being able to be present when the situation calls for it (~3 times so far), such as he will be having dinner with his family/friends later hence he is unable to come over to help me etc. Sometimes he would only respond 4-5 hours later claiming he is asleep or playing games and did not realise I was texting him. Whenever I turned to my friends for help instead, they often wonder why my bf is barely available in this case. I'm starting to wonder if i am even a priority to him, or just a once-a-week commitment. I don't think I am asking too much just by increasing the frequency of meeting up to twice a week occasionally as most of my friends and siblings meet up with their S.O 4-5 times a week on average.-#97611: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97611",52,10,0,0,8,36,0,16,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#97608,17/4/2021,"I really need to rant this out. I’m open to any possible good advice. Before I rant this out, I just want to let you guys know that I love pets, be it dogs or cats, or even smaller ones like guinea pigs or hamsters, and I have nothing against pets at all.My gf has a pet corgi, and as I mentioned earlier, I like dogs, so I love her dog as well, but I feel that my gf has gone too far in terms of treating her corgi to the point of where I think she treats her dog better than herself. Since this is her first pet dog, I thought it was okay to be treating her dog in such exaggerated ways, at least for the first few months, but apparently her dog’s 3rd birthday is coming up soon, yet I never see her stop splashing so much money on her dog.Not only does she buys her dogs snacks from pet shops that can easily cost like $20, she also feeds him with expensive meat like salmon together with branded dog biscuits. My gf doesn’t really take cab unless really necessary, but cos she is so into her dog that she wanna brings him to wherever she goes, and since public transport doesn’t allow pet, so she often takes cab just so that she can bring her dog along too. I actually asked her why can’t she just leave her dog at home, and guess what, she yelled at me for being a heartless person who has the gut to abandon our pet at home. She seriously thinks that leaving your dog at home when you’re out means you’re indirectly abusing your dog. When I told her, hey but you also leave your dog at home when you go to work, but she said that’s because she has no choice, else she’ll definitely bring her dog to work too. Besides that, she would also bring her dog to some outdoor or pet-friendly restaurants or cafes, including those at MBS cos according to her logic, her corgi will also enjoy the scenery and be delighted just like us. As you guys might have guessed, yes, as she dines at those restaurants/cafes, she would order extra so that she can feed her corgi with those expensive food as well. I kid you not, she even feeds him with steak from Bread street kitchen! You guys might be thinking oh well if that’s her money and she can afford, and she thinks that makes her dog happy, so that’s her business. The truth is her salary is slightly above 3k, and she is still paying off her uni bank loan, supporting her retired parents, and barely has any savings left every month. And also, sometimes I’m the one who pay for our bills but she still insists on ordering some meat of healthier choice for her dog. Right now we’ve been together for 2 years and we’re actually considering to settle down and buy a flat, but I have no idea how I should bring this up to her. I mean, it can’t be me the one who fully support the housing cost right? I don’t mind paying more than half of it, and in fact I tend to pay for our bills more often during outing. Given the fact that her corgi can easily spend up to $100-200 a week, I seriously think that she should be more logical and start thinking rationally for the sake of our future. I sometimes find her really childish for being so overly attached to the dog. She also gets all excited when kids run towards her corgi and start petting him or taking pictures of him. Any good advice peeps?-#97608: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97608",106,21,5,0,22,53,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
#97605,17/4/2021,"Hi all. I think my friend is somewhat delusional but i don’t know how to tell her. She believes she is a psychic/medium who can read ppl’s minds and claims she have spirit friends... I wanted to give her my support at first and tried to listen to whatever she has to say regarding her beliefs. I usually just listen without commenting much… But the more she tells me, the more i think she is just being scammed by the shops who are selling these things to her. For example, she bought a stone crystal (which can be found at taobao for $4, for over $1000 as apparently there is a spirit(like a vampire or something) inside which gives her powers). She also bought some spirits which doesn’t come with anything, claiming that it will be bound to her soul. She said she can see/hear the spirit and ask them to do things/favours for her… and she 100% believes it works.She even encouraged me to get a spirit but I don’t really believe in these things.. and I’ve made myself clear too.She is a very smart person in general, smarter than me i think… so idk how i can approach this topic with her while still being  respectful to her beliefs. Her partner also knows she is doing all these things, but he seems fine with it??? I am quite worried as she has spent probably more than 10k(very low estimate) on this “hobby”? Or should i not approach this topic at all and let her be? Thanks!-#97605: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97605",23,3,0,0,8,9,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

#97602,17/4/2021,"Now that I think about my JC and high school days, it seems that some teachers honestly take their jobs too seriously. Do some of them get a kick out of being rude and mean to teenagers? Don't get me wrong, being a teacher is a legitimate and respectable job, but some teachers really bring this ""I'm better than you"" mentality to their jobs. I had this teacher in high school who gained notoriety for being mean to every teenager. There was once I was asked to arrange the tables after school, and he told me that I could not go home until after he has come to make sure that the tables were in order. I waited in the classroom for 3 hours after school until he came, after held me there for an additional 2 hours. He would come to the classroom, tell me to think about what was wrong, without telling me anything else, and he would leave for an hour. By the time I reached home that day, it was 8pm. My parents were furious.My dad, who was a regional managing partner of an MNC at the time, found this completely unacceptable. He came to school the next day and demanded to meet this teacher. My teacher's justification for his ""punishment"" was so I could learn discipline. My dad told him straight in the face, ""I have greater ambitions for my son other than to become a teacher of children. If he follows your values that's where he will end up. This isn't discipline. This is just teaching my son how to be a slave."" I never saw that teacher again.I've now just graduated from an Ivy League university and my first job paid 200k USD in 2020, and I wonder if that teacher still thinks his antiquated army-style form of education is right. I'm sure many still do.-#97602: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97602",37,12,0,0,23,67,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

#97580,17/4/2021,"Hi again, Im the OP of 97554. I have read thr the previous comments and hear to answer some questions: Im definitely given birth by my mom and dad. Im not adopted. ( tho i moght as well be). My younger sister who is adored is only 16 years old ( opening a company needs to be arnd 18 i think? ) so thats out of the question. They cant use my elder sister as well as she is currently overseas and my mom said it is inconvenient if any documents need to be signed, she wont be here. My elder sis and I are beaten up since young. But my younger sister is adored. Long story short. When me and my elder sis was young my father just started is company. So he was in a lot of stress ( what my mom said). So whenever he is stressed he took it out on me and my elder sis. Since young (even until now) i was told to just suck it up and understand that he is stressed, and that i need to respect him no matter what as at the end of the day, he is my father. Since my elder sis left singapore. I was the only one he can sorta vent his anger out on. One reason why my younger sister is able to get doted on because she knows when to go "" dadddddyyyy pls get this for me.... i want this"" (idk what 撒娇 is in english pls halp). I dont do it to him cos i feel disgusted. As for those who ask if i have anyone whom i can talk to. I have an amazing bf, friends and my grandparents. I dont talk to my grandparents about this however, because they tend to over worry about me which is really not good for their health. My bf tells me not to agree too. But i just need some other advices. I have not talk to my friend because i just dont want to burden them with this. Plus they wont be sure how to handle. ( told them about a similar situation before but theu dont really know... which i dont blame them at all!!!)As for moving out. I was planning to move out once i graduate. Just because it is a good timing to do that. I can finish my studies and then just walk away. My mom said i have to give them 25% of my salary the moment i start working (it is unfilial if i dont) but im leaving for good after my graduation. So i wont be giving them a cent. They have 3 other children so money for them isnt an issue. My dad has a huge amount of cpf as well. I am from nursing. So sponsorship money is used to pay my uni. (1000$ per month).  So i technically dont have enough money to move out as of now. But i will have a job almost immediately after graduation. So salary/finance wont be an issue once i move out after graduation. My dad was bankrupt due to other party not able to return them money for a certain project, resulting in him not able to pay his supplier. He did say that after is bankrupcy (he has 2 or 3 more years) he will change the name back to his own name. Hope this helps u guys understand the situation. I will be saying no to then definitely. But the reason why i am so anxious abt saying no is because of the shit attitude and treatment i will be facing once i say no. I so tired to deal with that because as you know asian family, u are the biggest SINNER if u dont help ur family members especially ur PARENTS.-#97580: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97580",25,1,0,19,0,17,0,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#97574,17/4/2021,"Have been in NS for a few months now and my relationship is starting to take a toll on me.Obviously, I love my girlfriend and I see us getting married in the future. But her behaviour towards me whilst I am serving the nation has been very lacking.I try to text her everytime I get a chance to use my phone but she doesn’t seem to understand and appreciate the fact that I actually am unable to have my phone nor use my phone whenever I want to. Freedom is very limited here and it just doesnt seem to register in her.I am also often nagged at by her, being told things like im not doing things right or I couldve done xxx better. Being already tired to the daily training regime, her messages are often demoralising and I really dont appreciate her lack of encouragement and love.There has been times during lights out where she would unintentionally start a fuss (either at or not at me) right before I head to sleep and this often disallows me to go to bed on time and get ample rest. I would then have to stay up till she feels better before I feel like im allowed to go to bed. Initially, I thought it was fine because maybe she was unaware that I am tired. But this has been happening constantly and ive just so tired and I cant seem to tell her how I feel. Even on the topic of sex, she does not seem to realise that I am tired? I am expected to initiate and do ALL the work. Sometimes i would like it more if she would just give me a good time instead of the opposite.I thought it would be understandable that men serving NS are having a tough time adapting to the military lifestyle and through the physically intensive training.  All I want is for her to show me she loves me and supports me for what I do. To all women who have their significant other in the army, please do your part to tell them you love them and support them whenever you can. We do not receive a lot of emotional support other than from our loved ones being inside here.

#97558,17/4/2021,"I've met someone who I have gotten along with superbly. We flirt a lot and very often, though mostly in a joking manner, with a lot of physical touching given we're both touchy people. Recently, we've been spending a lot of time together, and I've found myself catching some feelings for her, especially since she's brought some much missed light back into my life. This is unfortunate, given she has a boyfriend (which I was only made aware of after a few months of us meeting, given she's mostly quiet on it, and is actually quite reluctant to mention his existence), though she's often communicated to me that she thinks it is only a matter of time before they separate given certain issues in their relationship. While this is obviously theoretically positive news for me, I do not wish to contribute in any way to their separation, and am extremely reluctant to comment on their situation to her, or act on my feelings in any form. But of course, it can be upsetting on my end finding myself in such circumstances, having to interact with her while keeping a lid on my feelings. Additionally, I sometimes worry that the time I spend with her, or that the joking-flirting might cross some boundaries, and lead to trouble down the road.While I would love to continue to be friends, given it has been a great deal of fun spending time with her, I am considering temporarily enacting the nuclear option to cut off contact with her in an attempt to suppress or diminish my feelings for her, and ensure no boundaries are crossed. I just wish to cause no trouble or drama, though it might potentially be a selfish course of action to do so. Obviously, I am unsure of what I should do, so I am here to seek out advice.

#97554,17/4/2021,"Hi, i have a pretty urgent issue that i need help with. Hope admin wont filter this. So background info. I was always violently beaten up by my dad, to the point he will use metal rods to hit me and throw chairs at me. He constantly verbally abused me, saying im useless and why dont i just go die. But me being in an asian household, i thought it was normal so i have to just suck it up. So it lasted till my 20s. As u can tell i wasnt his favourite... my sister has it totally different. She was adored and spoilt by my dad. Everything she wants she can have it. She can lash out at my parents and they wont even be angry. What a joke. So it has been a year since my dad ever talked to me. (Which honestly i couldnt care less... ) due to some trivial issues where he thinks i didnt help him in the way he wants me to. So since young we have the habit of greeting any elders whom we see. I greeted him initially. After almost a year... i stopped because i heard from my brother that my dad gives a disgusted look when i call him or when he sees me walk by. My mom scolded me for this. But she never understood me. Because if she did she will know i hate rejections and after being rejected with a disgusted look every single day for a year. Im so done with him or my family. So yesterday, i was the only one at home, and someone was at the door. I thought it was a mailman as i buy tonnes of shit from online shopping. When i was at the door, i saw my dad. So out of respect, i opened the door and greeted him. To my surprise, he acknowledged it. So that night i was kinda happy as i was like... is he gonna talk to me again (i hate him still, but as a daughter, i wanted to be acknowledged). At 4am in the morning, my mom came into my room (she wakes up arnd this timing) and told me she need to discuss something with me. So my dad needs to open a company. But due to him being  bankrupt, he cant use his name. So he has to use someone else. And u guessed it. He wanted to use mine. So it dawned on me that he greeted me because he needs me to do sth... so obviously I didnt wanted him to use. So i gave my mom an excuse that I was having a scholarship, so i wasnt sure if im allowed to do this. (It is a true reason tho). Then she said since im graduating next year, they can wait till next year. So i was like i cant give u promises. She then startes to guilt trip me by saying if i dont help, there is really no one else. Saying that i always dont help them when they are in need (which i do, but they dont care, do they). So i told her i will think about it. This morning arnd 8am she came into my room again and ask me to pass her my sponsorship contract  she will show it to their lawyer to see if i can open a company under my name despite me having the contract. So im at a loss. I definitely dont want to let them use. So can yall help me come up with a way to reject them. (Because if i reject. Im going to get hated for not helping once again). And if there is any law students, can you help me see if this is actually legal? Or will i have any consequences in my credit score etc as my parents are bankrupt. So im sure they cant open a company using their own name.-#97554: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97554",77,14,0,23,0,36,0,22,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I learnt a few months ago that she was seeing this other guy back then before we got together (who was already attach at the time) on the side, and they actually did it many times. To make matters worse she actually did very intimate things like swallowing his.. well you know.. she wouldn’t even swallow mine. I can’t help but constantly think about it, I mean firstly why wouldn’t she swallow mine?? Am I less attractive than the first guy?? and I found out from a friend of mine that she and that guy actually took videos of their acts together at the time (and this is also the friend who told me she swallows), and it’s like a ticking time bomb for me as to when these videos will surface. I can imagine someone doing a stupid prank on our wedding and airing the videos or something.On the surface I’m still trying my best to be gentle and attentive but I’m beginning to think that all this is because of how I find her physically attractive, which will eventually die off logically, especially since she is less intimate with me than with her “ex”.

I obviously do wanna date and have my first relationship, but is it worth it? Literally all the girls I’ve talked to just ghost, flake on dates, show interest for a while them lose interest. You get the point. It’s not like I’m socially inept, I’m not. I have friends, mostly guys, but the issue is about the dating / dating scene. And don’t get me started on the bias against guys (which I would probably see in the comments section) If a girl made this post, you’d be seeing tons of support from people / society saying “it’s ok, it’s not your fault. Men are trash etc.” but when a guy makes this “You not good enough for them. You’re not good looking enough. You’re not interesting enough. You don’t make enough money to show that you’re capable of dating.” What’s with this two faced, hypocritical nonsense? And this is a lot more common to hear here Anyways take online dating for an example, how good is it for anyone (especially guys) really? Statistics wise?

I cried in the toilet that morning cause I was so confused as to why a guy that I trusted, loved and respected me (he knows I’m very traditional) would treat me like this.When it happened for the second night, I was too scared to do anything but I gave some physical cues like turning away or pushing him slightly, but he just carried on anyway. He also kissed me when he thought I was asleep, this was my first kiss in my life and it was done to me without my consent. I was really upset because he asked for permission to kiss me when we started dating and I always said no. Mind you, it wasn’t the closed mouth kdrama kiss either, it was the sloppy af kind. I was so disgusted. I left on the third day by faking a family emergency. After the staycation, I sucessfully blocked the traumatic experience from my mind and everything went back to normal. Yes, I’m still dating him. I made excuses for him to why he would do this. I felt like the way I dealt with it was to pretend that it didn’t happen. I think I was in denial because I love him too much. But thinking back about the incident, I don’t think that what he did to me was okay. Am I crazy to feel this way?-#97536: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97536",172,47,31,34,0,43,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

If anyone’s from that hall, can you tell me how it is like? And how the other halls in NUS (like raffles hall, Temasek hall and Sheares hall) differ? I’m interested in the life and culture of all these halls, the hall activities, niche CCAs in the hall, and how balancing school work and hall life is like (basically everything). Also would be helpful if anyone could share their experience on how they got more involved in such extra activities if they are a bit more shy!

I find this very shocking, I always thought that Asian parents typically don't mind pretty much having their child around even past adulthood or even financially supporting them past adulthood.

#97480,17/4/2021,"Singaporeans, a majority of only worry about career and money and relationships the latter usually ignored. I graduated with a law degree overseas ten years ago, aged 31.I married a woman whom I loved a lot.At this time, I was living in a bungalow that my wife and I bought, I had a lucrative business on the side which I had sold a majority of.I secured a job at a law firm and after a year or so of 80-hour work weeks,I then secured a job as a counsel to a large MNC based in Europe. On a 2-year contract I left sg chasing a $1,200,000 a month job I was working 19 hours a day. I never replied to my parents calls nor my wife’s. I missed the birth of my son who died shortly after he was born.I didn't come back; I had no choice our firm was in the middle of a crisis.And I dare not face my family. To cover my grief, I kept working, I slept in the office and also sold off all my shares worth about $30,000,000 for $1 in the same I stared to my best friend, as she was the one I trusted the most to lead the firm also I had no interest in anything. After I had settled all the issues at work, I ended the contract and had to pay some money for ending it early, I also had to help find a replacement. I flew back the same day I handed in my letter to the firm.When I came home, I found a letter from my wife, she had left me, we then got a divorce. I did all this for my family they had a good life in my opinion. I sent my parents for holidays almost every month, I sent about. 50% of my income back to them. The remaining would usually be sent to charities. I paid of my sibling’s medical school fees too.And the rest to my wife, she got to live as a tai tai, over the years she spent almost $1,200,000 just on cars and Designer stuff.These are things I had no interest in but in my mind, I believed they kept my family happy. But no, I lost my family too. who moved overseas, they rarely spoke to me?I chased money the almost all the Cs except country club (totally hate most people there)All for my family, I think I never spent more than a day with them those few years.2 years ago, I found out form my in laws my wife had died (I will not specify how) but it was a dagger trough my heart, as I had intended to rekindle our love.I then wandered about for a year ...I have fixed my relationship with my parents who are now in their 70s, they are volunteer teachers, and they spend their time teaching students and helping build schools overseas, they had sold their own home to do this.I let go of everything 30% my money I put in a trust that will be used for charitable causes after I die 20%, I put aside for my SME that I founded to use, if I times of crisis. The remaining 50% I gave it away, I also gave away all the proceeds firm the sale of all my cars and homes and investments. I happy now, I help with my parents. And I work as a pro bono lawyer too.I still cry every night hoping I was not that rich that way my child may not have died. And my wife would be still with me.All the material stuff did not bring me any happiness, only for a second. After that no... just sadness What's worse is that I lost many good friends, and I didn't know and couldn't tell who my friends are back then.Please my fellow Singaporeans success Is best earned and achieved when you find true happiness and you have done your level best to contribute to society and made a positive difference in people’s lives. That will bring you much more happiness. Then any amount of money will.There is so much more to see and to do, let us not be blinded and distracted. by monetary and material gains Instead, please focus on your family, your children’s parents and passions you want to peruse. I hope we can start to value people better rather than who earns the most. or who has a degree or what not.I will give an example.In Singapore we see a Mercedes-Benz, oh wow we go that person must have lots of $$ and likely is successful.

#97476,17/4/2021,"I am so tired in my relationship.Last night my gf and I were on a date, and I was annoyed she was texting her friends during our date which I find quite disrespectful. Despite me expressing my displeasure, she did it multiple times. When I asked her was there an urgent matter, what was she texting about? She says ""forgot'. She even got super angry at me for daring to be upset that she is texting during our date. One childish move she did was when I was trying to take a photo of one of the dishes which just arrived, she immediately tore into it, as she saw me focusing with my camera. She also lashed out at me and said it must be my fault for being a boring person, which is why she texts on the date. She later retracted this statement and said it was said in a moment of anger, and the real reason she was texting was her friends and her were arranging a meetup for the next day.The next day I told her I barely slept the previous night due to me feeling hurt by a lot of hurtful untrue things she had said to me. She proceeded to verbally abuse me for the next 3 hours. Not only that, she flipped the tables on me and said I was the bad person because I got upset that she got upset at me. I feel so helpless. Over our 2 year relationship, everytime I tell her she hurt me, her response has almost always been to hurt me more. It seems to me that me telling her that she hurt me, shatters her image of herself as the most perfect person ever, so she gets excessively defensive and proceeds to protect herself by putting me down.The other day I also asked her over the last 2 years, she has never apologized a single time or owned any fault in any of our quarrels. I asked if she thinks there is any fault of hers behind any quarrel for the last 2 years? She thought about it then said her only two faults are allowing me to fall in love with her, as well as thinking too highly of me when we got together. Otherwise, every quarrel is completely my fault. I was honestly quite stunned by her response.Another thing she does is she loves to yell over me, insult me, then suddenly disappear or block me in any disagreement. I think it is a childish way for her to get the last word in and to frustrate me as then I have no way to respond. She will then proceed to have fun for hours or days while I feel anxious and stressed. She will then abruptly reappear at some point, write insulting or hurtful words to me, or call me to say these, then block me again before I can even respond. This cycle then repeats for a few rounds until she has had her fill.What makes me even more upset is she will always make me out to be the bad person. She will also lie and twist reality to support her version of what happened. She will then badmouth me to her friends then come back to me and tell me how ""everyone"" supports her. The interesting thing is she is a very popular person, with a very happy and outgoing public image. I often cannot reconcile how she can be such a monster behind closed doors. This also means that if I say out, no one will believe me also.Breakup is easy, can just walk away, so I am hoping not to have to do that unless really no choice. Is there any hope of reforming a girlfriend like her? 2 years is a lot to throw away.-#97476: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97476",152,21,0,11,0,48,0,34,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

Things are going pretty smoothly for us, both of us are pretty busy with our work schedules on a daily basis.Now we are just two very busy adults working non stop, things can get so busy with either of us that we can even not see each other for two weeks.His family is really nice and I really love his family. They are so loving and would invite me over for dinners. I have to admit I am at fault for being unable to attend the dinner sometimes due to my busy schedule.He would also meet his friends just for some casual drinks, almost every other day.His parents did mention to me that he had been drinking till late, and that they are worried about him drinking and smoking. They tried to hint me trying to make him quit smoking, but it’s not that easy given the fact that all his friends smokes. I’m not one who would control what he wants to do. I believe that he is old enough to know what is he doing. I mean he’s already an adult, no longer a juvenile. Just at times, I don’t know how to actually react to his parents “requests”. I understand his parents’ POV and “request” meant no harm as they just wanted him to be healthy too. They too, did remind me not to push him too hard if I were to ask him to quit smoking or drink lesser. They just don’t know how they can “remind him” anymore because if they do, they some how turns it into a nagging session and it kinda pisses him off. Till now I have yet to speak to him with regards to his parents “request”. I’m just afraid that things might turn not so nice between them as he is slowly getting a bit nicer to his family now as compared to before.-#97471: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97471",6,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Both my mom and dad asked me recently if my boyfriend (23) treats me food or if we pay for our own food. My mom thinks boyfriends should always pay for girlfriends and my dad thinks my boyfriend is too calculative. They both have a very traditional idea of courtship but ironically (or not) they are divorced. I didn't feel like lying to them so I just said that we take turns to pay, and tried to defend him by saying that he's still studying, like I am, and not earning any money yet. Chivalry sounds nice and all because who wouldn't want to be spoiled with gifts and free food? I wouldn't expect it because obviously times have changed but I feel bad that my parents are stuck in this idea and seem to not have the best impression of my boyfriend. Especially because he's quite introverted he doesn't usually make extra efforts to reach out to my family and my friends, so my friends and family always question our relationship. They don't challenge it outright and I've told my boyfriend about it whenever it happens as well....he doesn't seem to care...but it's not ideal because I obviously would like the people I care about to get along well (especially with my family, I wish I could be closer with them but these things make it hard).

#97469,17/4/2021,"Dear #96224, After reading your confession, I truly thought for a second that I was the one writing that.. My ex was exactly the same as your boyfriend. When we were together we met around once a week or slightly less. We lived really far from one another and he preferred to study alone. Although I did mention a couple of times he can come over to study if he wants, he would always say that he dont want and can only study at home. Because of his heavy school load, we would not have much time left for each other. Especially towards mid-terms period aand towards finals, sometimes we would only meet once a month and honestly I was ok with it as he was busy. I have told him many times that I prefer we met up more and we do not have to go out for fun dates (for long hours) we can just meet up occasionally for lunch or study dates in between our busy schedule.. or we can even just facetime each other.. but it never happened. Afterwards, he started a new business venture that took up even more of his time. We broke up as I could see that I am no way his priority and he said that going out with me has become more of a burden after a while. He claimed that he still loved me and I will still be his best friend no matter what. And let me tell you this, its all bullsht. We still follow each other on instagram as we are still friends. He has been going out a lot to study and just doing things he claimed he didnt prefer doing when he was with me. Aside from this issue of not spending enough time with me, there were other minor issues which would have amounted to gigantic redflags added together. But what made me waited so long before ending it was because even now after breaking up for almost one year, I still love him.To all the ladies out there, love yourself first. If the man does not treat you with respect and treats you well, learn to let go early. After breaking up, I thought, should I have compromised or maybe should I have been more understanding? If he has valid reasons for doing what he did, should I have waited for him to be less busy? Dont lower your standards for anyone is what Ive always believed in, but when you are faced with that situation, its damn f-ing hard to let it go.-#97469: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97469",4,5,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

So realising this, we (my ex and I) talked and everything was ok i got the closure I wanted but I still think of him.

She expects me to text her after she asked me to email her things she requested for at a certain time and then told me off when I didn’t inform her that I have emailed her. The last straw was she made a big deal in a group chat of other people on how 1) I didn’t submit something she requested by deadline(she sent me a lot of things 2) I did submit but I couldn’t access the link so I sent via email 3) she got a bitch fit and criticise me in the group chat that consist of few people including a store manager who reports to me. She said that I shouldn’t make her go into the file in and out for that 2-3 mins. I feel that she’s rude, domineering, micromanaging and just unrealistic. She kicked up a big fuss when she needed something from me but she took days to reply an email from me.My best friend advised me not to leave but to face her. I think it’s because she’s one of the most senior, most of the things get slided over.

We didn’t have a chance to talk to each other as M is in another department while I am in human resource department. The first time we had a proper conversation was when one of my co-workers from the same department asked me to join them at the smoking area. We were both introduced to each other formally for the first time and subsequently we have been smoking together with the others. M would always say nice comments on the outfits I wear to work or the way I style my hair, buying me drinks or treating me to me lunch but I always politely decline. At the start I felt uncomfortable, but he is married so I thought he treats me like his own daughter as he is twice my age. However, I was having finals a few weeks back and took a week off from work to study for my finals. After I return back to office, one of my colleague told me and said that M kept asking about my whereabouts and looked very sad throughout the week when I was not in office, and they conclude that it is because of me. I just brushed it off, telling them it is just coincidence as he is married and wouldn’t have interest in me. So fast forward, M asked me out for drinks 2 days ago during the weekend and said that the other colleagues are joining too, so I accepted the invite and went to drink with them. But turns out when I reach the bar, he already started drinking and said that the others are not coming as they have plans last minute. I wanted to leave as I don’t feel comfortable drinking or spending time alone with him, so I went out of the bar, but he chased after me and confessed to me and said he really like me. He was high from all those drinks and even placed his hands around my waist. I struggled to break free but he went ahead to kiss me on my lips. I was shocked and pushed him away and ran home.

#97460,17/4/2021,"Gonna be long, TLDR: Looking for advice on pursuing a private Data Science or Business Analytics degree because my GPA is trash (2.2), and I really am a blur fuck.First off, I have a bad GPA because a lot of unfortunate and unforeseen events happened in my personal life that have caused me to be unstable during my polytechnic years, and that resulted in my abysmal GPA, having to retake multiple modules because I can't focus on my studies (but also because I'm blur) but more on that later. I accept full responsibility for my poor performance and would like to carve a better future for myself by taking a degree.Personally, my interests lie in Data Science. To sum it up, I like the way it is so logical, and so rational. Data is literally an abstraction of reality and that I can see myself organizing and managing data structures yadayada, Also, someone with a Data Science degree can perform the roles of a Business Analyst and not the other way around, so I thought it'd be pretty good to study Data Science, so my knowledge would be deeper and my scope would be wider.However, here are the cruxes,Data Science is heavy on CS and I can't help but think that Professor Ben said that one's performance in CS is very dependent on their aptitude, and that has been holding me back a lot on whether I should pursue Data Science or Business Analytics as the former is more CS intensive, whereas the latter has a bit of Data Science and Business, which I am also fairly interested in. Given my horrible 2.4 GPA from poly, I am afraid that even passing the the degree would be unnecessarily strenuous and that I would always be constantly behind my classmates.Furthermore, I read that many Data Scientists often hold a masters degree, and unless I do so in a field already full of superhigh IQ peeps, I'll always be lagging behind the restPerhaps, I was thinking, take a Business Analytics degree, then take Data Science courses externally? I wish I could end things here, but I cannot.To make things worse, I am also insanely careless. I suspect I might have ADHD, idk. All along as I'm studying, I am often losing a solid 20-30% of my marks in my Math and Sciences because of stupid mistakes (wrote a + instead of a - or read the question wrongly, like 3 times??? ) It's ridiculous and I don't understand how I'm plagued with this. Even irl I am slightly dysfunctional, I keep dropping my phone, and I've been told I'm a type A neat freak, which makes it worse because even if my things are so neat and my belongings are in plain sight, I simply MISS IT COMPLETELY. It strains my relationships with those who I live with, and even army is stressful because I'm a total blur fuck. Looking for my water bottle high and low in bunk when I left it back in stadium, to the amusement of my platoon mates.Anyway, I have done some simple programs with Python and I found it incredibly enjoyable except for the parts where I took a solid 4 hours to look for a minor mistake. I am afraid that this part of me would be incredibly exacerbated when I take either of those degrees.Lastly, not sure if it matters but I have an IQ of 110 (taken multiple, free and paid IQ tests to check if the above happened because I am intellectually challenged) and I read that the average IQ of a university student is a 120.

#97458,17/4/2021,"Serious post. Anybody with experience lodging a complain to CASE under the consumer fair protection act?Recently I bought a second hand bike from a bike shop(it wasn't cheap). The bike shop owner/mechanic said that he ran all diagnostic checks and there were no problems. I rode it around the compound, no major issues so I bought it. But it gave me some issues immediately after I bought it, so I sent it to a workshop near my house and what I thought was a minor problem turned out to be a whole bucket list of problems. Basically this bike mechanic did not tell me what he should have been able to find out through his 'diagnostic tests'. Either he found out and didn't tell me, or he didn't even check it, or he was incompetent. Asked around and apparently a number of other motorists have bad experience with this mechanic. One guy's bike was destroyed after this mechanic failed to tighten a nut in the engine.(nut came loose and destroyed everything in its path when the engine was running). It was obviously his fault but he refused to own up. Unfortunately I don't have his statements on black and white. I was wondering if such a complaint would be successful with CASE? Or what can they do for me, and what else can I provide for then to  solve this problem for me effectively? In short, does anybody know what I can do next? Thanks in advance.

SMU would probably be the most sensible choice for me, but my dad desperately wants me to go to Wharton. I think the money he would spend on my degree would be far better utilised if capitalised in our business. Since his plan for me is to take over his business, I honestly don't see how much value a Wharton degree would add to my career. His rationale for going to Wharton is I will get a much a better education in terms of living independently, rubbing shoulders with students who were raised in highly successful families, and experiencing a foreign country. More crucially, he wants me to dilute my excessive ""Singaporean-ness"" with regards to army-style rule-following, risk aversion, and being penny-wise and pound-foolish, traits he collectively coins ""HDB mentality."" He explained that all of this will help me run a business much more competently.I am open to going to Wharton, I just want to do it for logical reasons. My dad is a lot older and has experience running a highly successful business. I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt that his reasons have merit. I have no way of knowing otherwise. Would also like to reiterate that I think SMU is the right choice. Can I just get some input?-#97450: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97450",11,1,0,1,1,7,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

#97439,17/4/2021,"I could not find any answers online so here goes.My daughter is too sensitive and mature. She is 10. We have a happy family. My husband and I are happily tgt. A few times when she told me she made plans with her friend (our neighbour) and I commented that I planned a family dinner, she would immediately cancel on her friend.Once she was on her way back from tuition (just across the street from our house), she texted me to say she saw some nice and cheap t shirts and asked me if I wanted. I said OK if they are cheap. I didnt know by the time I replied she already reached home! She went back across the street to buy. On the surface it looks nice to have such a great child but I have learnt that she listens so much to the point where she will sacrifice herself for others. Now I'm at a point where I have to think twice before I say anything. It's kind of tiring tbh. I'm not sure how many parents out there have children like this. My biggest fear is that I will unknowingly hurt or influence my child's decision somehow somewhere bcus she listens/cares too much. I don't want her to cancel plans with her friends just bcus of me. Idw to be the reason she doesn't have a childhood. Do any of you understand this situation? It's really more tiring than raising a immature child. You have to be so careful at every step. I have to specifically makes comments like  ""don't go if you are alrdy at home."" or ""Mummy can handle this alone."". Otherwise she will feel obligated to tag along. She feels that it is her responsibility to tag along. Once I told her I'm not cooking anymore and told her to go with her friends just so that she will go. I think even this hurt her. I could tell from her facial expression. Once in a while, she would use some of her saving to buy sweets for her friends. Tbh I don't like her doing this. Once is OK but... I told her she should spend the money on herself. I'm saying this partly bcus I know her friends won't reciprocate. I'm not saying we do things only to get sth back. Aiya Yall adults know what I'm saying lah. Idw her to become a laughing stock or sth. I'm sure yall have met people who give too much and they themselves end up don't get any help bcus most ppl don't care. I have been trying to teach her to protect her own interest. It is okay to give but we need to grasp the right amount. Once she gave all her biscuits away and lied that she still had some more in her bag. Good thing she has a good friend who knows her well enough. I asked her why she lied. She said she lied because she knew if she said she had no biscuits then her friends would have to give up theirs to give to her. It hurts me bcus the truth is most people don't care. Most people won't bother to ask if you have any biscuits. Just bcus they asked doesn't mean they care. Yall know what I mean. They asked just to ask. Even if you said you have no biscuits how many will share?? Do yall understand my frustration?? Those biscuits belong to her to begin with. She bought them using her own money. She was once accidentally locked in the classroom by the class monitress. She went to hide herself and rejoined the class when they were back from morning assembly like nth happened. I asked her why. She said if she made a fuss, the classmate would get scolded. Once she fell sick during some CIP. She refused to say anything until her good friend told the teacher. I asked her why she didn't voice earlier. She said bcus she wasn't done with her part yet and if she left her classmates would need to do more. I told her she should stop because of herself. She is really intelligent but gives too much.-#97439: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97439",74,82,0,152,0,185,41,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

He never wanted to tell anyone I'm his gf, but expected me to announce to the world that he is my bf.Fast forward, on my birthday, he gave me a couple ring. I was so happy that I decided to stay with him. Few days later, he laughed and said ""wow, I never knew anyone can be so stupid like you. $88 for a present can make you stay.

We are in different departments but our respective departments have to be in close coordination in order for the co to function well.She is a friendly, outgoing and nice girl. She's 27/28 while I am 24. We would always get to see each other in the main hq until somewhere late last year, she was redeployed to one of the co's branch. We are on very good terms and she would always offer me tips and advice how to adjust and motivate me to do well. We would sometimes stop for a short chat and joke with each other. I must admit, I am attracted to her but I have been suppressing my feelings for her. She mentioned she has a boyfriend and from the picture she uses as her W.A. profile pic, I can tell he is a good person. I am now stuck, should I let her know my feelings for her or should I suppress it for life until the day I die?

Whenever we meet new people and someone asks me what course I'm doing, before I have a chance to answer he blurts out 'FASS' and then changes the subject. I don't correct him because I don't want to embarrass him in front of other people, and when I ask him about it in private he keeps saying that he just gets FASS confused with Law because 'they sound similar'. I asked him if it was because FASS is lower than his course on the IGPs, but he says that's just a coincidence. Also, I can't watch Netflix with him anymore because he keeps trying to spoil every episode while we're watching it. I've asked him to stop but he insists that they can't be spoilers because he hasn't seen the show, he just has psychic powers. When I pointed out that Iron Man was unlikely to make an appearance in Bridgerton, he made some unintelligible screeching noises and left the room in tears. Another time I woke up to find him standing over me with bags under his eyes. As soon as he noticed I was awake he announced that he knew 'all eight digits of pi' and smugly rattled them off. I waited for him to finish before telling him that I didn't think the third digit was a 6, and a quick google search confirmed that he had spent the early hours of the morning memorising what appeared to be the telephone number for a massage palour at Parklane Shopping Centre. I love him but I don't know how much more of this I can take.

Wld like to ask some advice from homeowners: is it worth it to get an interior designer and go for a premium reno?We have been shopping around for reno packages. For a basic reno, we have been quoted from 30-50k. We have also approached a few interior designers and their packages ranges from 100-150k. We are particularly impressed by the offering from one interior designer. They are famous in this field and promised a luxurious experience after the reno is completed. They showed us many projects they have completed and the final product is just comparable to a luxury hotel. They would use premium materials and many of the furnishings are imported overseas. The price quoted to us is about 130k inclusive of all furnishing but excluding any electrical items. If we were to go for this, we would empty out any remaining savings we have and need to take an additional reno loan of 80k. Both of us came from humble backgrounds and particularly for me, have lived in a cramped and messy 3 room hdb in the past and really want to experience the luxury living.

She isnt trying to one up you, she would have just taken a law boyfriend rather than you but you dont seem happy, so just break up since youre inferior.

#97404,17/4/2021,"Is it impossible to accumulate $100 mil unless you go into business?I'm graduating next year and it seems the ""standard"" approach to life is to get a good job, and then work a salary your whole life. I ran the numbers recently and it seems like it is impossible for anyone to become rich this way. Even if you started out with a salary of $400K, which is typical for a partner at a Big 4 accounting firm, over a 30-year career, you would only have earned $12 mil gross. Realistically, it would take more than 15 years to make partner at a Big 4. In the same period, property prices would have doubled 3 times, assuming the adage is true that property prices doubles every 10 years. Even if it only doubles over a 30-year period (very unlikely), a 10,000 sq ft landed property in a prime district like Bukit Timah, which already costs $15 mil now, would be worth $30 mil. $12 mil isn't even half. So, even if you climbed to the top of the corporate ladder, which has a lower probability than being hit by a car, it is unlikely that one would be able to join the GCB-class in Singapore.I'm not saying being middle-class isn't already a good life, and I'm not saying money is everything in life, but it seems that if one were to aspire to own their own landed property in Singapore, the property ladder is already too high to climb for anyone starting out now. I don't even know if I'd be able to afford a condo of the same size as the 3-bedroom HDB flat I grew up in. But even in business, you use to be able to earn very good returns on simple businesses, such as running a chicken rice stall, or a corner shop selling sundries. Nowadays, the margins are so thin that it makes more sense to work a salary. The future seems really bleak for anyone born after the 90s to become really wealthy. I don't want to be an alarmist, but it seems really unfair to people like me, having not much to leverage from their parents, to become wealthy over a single generation. I envy my peers who are taking over their parents businesses, instead of having to slog it out in the workforce, when wage growth is clearly going to be outpaced dramatically by land prices and cost of living.-#97404: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97404",66,23,0,0,9,43,0,10,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
#97401,17/4/2021,"Hi, SoC alumni here. Seeing the posts about folks looking for internships and jobs, I want to showcase an alternative career path: do a startup. Make a unicorn. Whether you succeed or not, you would be enjoying each day.The general perception is that the chances of success are remote and it is a lot of hard work. Yes, both a true but they do not tell the full story.For one, you won’t be working harder than employees necessarily. I do not see how my work hours will change if I take a job. But what will change is that you will be more motivated if this is your company. And it is easier to then see the upside of grunt work.Also, it is a myth that raising money is hard. I am an average student and I did not even have a deck when raising the first round. You don’t need everyone to believe in your vision, you just need a few angels. And if you believe in the idea enough to spend all your time on it, why would others not? And Singapore is full of early stage investors. It is really a good place to start a company.In a job, you are expected to figure things out. In a startup, your investors will help you do that. You can hire people who know more to help you with whatever you do not know. A startup with a vision to be a unicorn is the only work environment where so many people want to do their best to help you succeed for their own good. I just pick up the phone when I cannot get a sale to close or when the website is taking too long to be built, and investors or advisors suggest ideas. All you then need to do is implement them and ask for help again. Unlike a job, asking for help is a virtue.You will never have a mid life crisis because you will be working om something that changes the world. There would always be purpose and a vision.You decide your timings, you decide the policies etc.. For example, we do work from home because I like sleeping late and starting the day right after I wake up at around 10am. I just need to fetch my computer to start work.And what is failure in a startup? You don’t get enough traction? You can sell the company any time, you will still have created value and you will already be ready to do your second startup after 2 years. It will be easy to do everything the 2nd time around because you are experienced.Finally, this is the only way to change your life radically. A well paying job might net you 250K in savings a year. But will that change your lifestyle? No. And you will likely be spending hours doing tasks you do not completely believe in. A good exit in a startup means your lifestyle will actually change.Boys and girls, consider chasing the unicorn dream. This is the best time in human history to do it. Everyone will support you. NUS Enterprise, private investors, customers, etc. etc.. And you will be changing the world in some meaningful way too if you succeed, how cool is that?-#97401: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97401",10,2,0,0,1,16,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Everyone often ask me, “Do you have time for your BF?” I always smiled and said, “He was the one who doesn’t have time for me.” I admit that I am emotionally attached to him, and I miss him sometimes so I really need to see him physically, not in video call, especially when we are both in Singapore, but he said that he was too busy and sometimes stop me from going over to his place, when he said he got “no mood” to see me, it really crushed me. I am willing to go over to his place at his convenience just to see him. I just don’t understand why he could not give me the time. And usually when we are spending time together, he is reading his study material and I am reading my Japanese class material, I don’t mind if he didn’t talk to me at that time at all. I just want him to be with me for some time. I already talked to him regarding this for a few times but it didn’t really wake him up until I told him I want to break up. Probably it’s the best that we part ways and hopefully he can find someone better or he can finally put his focus on study.-#97388: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97388",7,1,0,3,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
#97387,17/4/2021,"I have been seeing this guy for almost 2 months after first meeting him on a dating app. He's super cute and charismatic and is doing pretty well in his startup career while attending uni in nus. However, after every dinner date, he would propose to chill at his place, quoting that there was no one at home and he's lonely. I rejected it almost every time but the following day he would proceed to send this long wall of text to guilt trip me, saying that im not considerate to his feelings enough and that it is unfair for him. I've told him before that im not comfortable with progressing into physical intimacy so soon and would like to take some time to know him more but he would always refute and say sth like i can only get to know him better by going over. This has gone on for over a month and recently, he bluntly mentioned that if i cannot be there to satisfy his sexual needs im not the one for him. Would it be possible to change a guy's mindset or should i just leave him be??-#97387: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97387",80,6,0,0,17,24,0,0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
#97386,17/4/2021,"This guy and I have been seeing each other for 9 months and we're both in uni. This rs in particular is different to the two relationships I've had in the past where there's actually space between us, so there was a bit of an adjustment period on my part with regards to my abandonment issue, I can confidently say I'm doing a good job managing it though. I didn't bring it up to him because I knew it was a personal issue, and I knew it was something to deal with myself. I knew it was something I had to look inwards for. What I did bring up, however, was that I felt unappreciated and felt that he had no time for me, our conversation was literally only good morning and goodnight, he doesn't ask how I am etc., and I told him that mattered to me, that expressing your love towards someone isn't a grand gesture, but lies in the small actions you do. I told him several times, but although he apologized several times, there was no change in his behavior. I just do my best to understand him, I don't have control over what he does/thinks, but I have control over how I choose to make of things, how I choose to perceive or think of things as. I don't think it's anything personal. I mean, when you get too swamped with studies, you just drown, right? I mean, that's not the case for myself as I always ask him how he is etc even if I'm swamped in studies too, but that doesn't mean it's the same for everyone. He had time to play an hp game with his friends after class, staying up until past midnight - 4 AM, but not enough time to message me, okay, he's probably destressing from studies. There are times when I'm the same, and then when he messages me, it's just a goodnight. Okay, I suppose he's tired. I'd be tired too. It got to a point where I broke down and begged him to at least listen to me, reply to me, or hear me out because I felt like I wasn't being listened to or appreciated or anything. He just ignored me and was watching a movie, and that really hurt me. He told me he wasn't in the mood. Okay, I understand, I wish he'd told me earlier. The next day, he told me he was going through something and I understood, but he still didn't bother to reassure me and continued to ignore my concerns. He told me what specifically what he was going through, and I understood and comforted him and everything, with my concerns not having been brought up since. I guess it's something I'd have to deal with myself, right? I can give that reassurance to myself, I can choose what to think of how I perceive things, but honestly, it hurts a lot. I tried to bring up my concerns again a few times more, but I just get ignored or he tells me he's busy, okay, I understand. Whenever I asked him when it could be talked about, I just got ignored, and I told him that I want him to at least tell me when it could be talked about, but there was nothing again. I just understood him. He must not have the emotional capacity to because of how stressed he is. Okay, I'll do my best to be a supportive and understanding partner. I'll deal with it myself. Honestly, I feel like he has broken my trust in him.. He apologized so many times only for nothing to change. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells being around him, I can't explain it, but sometimes, I think ""is it okay for me to open up to him? Is he in a good mood? Is now a good time to open up to him?"" I know the last question is a good question to think as it's important to be mindful of other people too, not only of yourself, but I don't know if I'm able or I'd be able to open up to him again, the few times I did it, I was just pushed away. Sure, I understand, he had his reasons, but I don't know, it just hurt, and I'm scared of opening up only for the same thing to happen again. I feel like bringing up anything to him doesnt do anything either, since there's no change despite how many times I already brought stuff up. So what I do is just to look inwards. I just work on myself. I just do my best to reframe how I think about stuff. After all, I'm the only one I have control over. No point stressing over what I don't have control over, right? Might as well just accept it.Meanwhile, whenever he's down, even if I'm busy, I comfort him immediately/reassure him/listen to him/anything. When I get those uncomfortable feelings anytime at all lately, I deal with it myself. I don't bother bringing it up to him anymore. It's a me problem anyway. I just journal out whatever thoughts or feelings I have in mind and they go away. I think I'm doing great actually, I like that I don't seek reassurance from him anymore, and that I give it to myself.However, I want to ask, is this normal? Oftentimes, I think about what if I feel an uncomfortable feeling again in the future? I know he is not responsible for my feelings though, but what if it's about me feeling unappreciated etc again? Can I open up to him? I honestly cannot answer that question. I don't know if I can. I think I will just get pushed aside like nothing again, and I think it'd be better for me to not rely on him. I can rely on myself instead; however, I can't help but have a thought at the back of my mind:Is this how a relationship should be? Yes, you're not supposed to lose yourself in a relationship, there's still supposed to be space between the two of you; however, aren't you supposed to at least be there for each other, listen to each other's woes or anything? I know I've been doing that for him to this day without a doubt, but am I robbing him of his chances, ""ruining"" what we have over being scared of opening up to him considering his track record? Am I being too overbearing? Am I being too clingy for wanting time with him, for wanting him to listen to me, to feel appreciated even though he's busy? But I've been doing those things (time, listening to him, comforting him, reassuring him, making him feel loved and cared for etc) for him  I'm so confused  I don't understand myself and I don't understand if what I'm doing is right.. I know I have control over if I stay or leave, and I choose to stay, but there's those nagging thoughts at the back of my head..  I just want to give my best and do my best so I don't have regrets, I give it my all, but it hurts a lot, but even so, I just understand him and reframe my thinking into how I have control over how I perceive things, it's probably nothing personal..-#97386: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97386",9,3,0,5,0,6,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#97382,17/4/2021,"Prior to 2020, being a cabin crew was very sought after. But not many people know that actually there are a lot of foreign crews in Singapore Airline. I didn't know I have such a nationalistic sentiments prior to joining the airline. Out of my batch of 20, only 1/4 were Singaporeans. I felt like I was in a foreign land when I was in class. Majority of them are very nice people but a few of them did make unnecessary remarks while I was there. I remembered that there was one Malaysian trainee who announced to the whole class that she was only using Singapore as a stepping stone, so she can live and work in Europe next time. Fast forward many years, she is now married with kids in Singapore to a local. I guess Singapore has something better to offer to her than Europe after all. My trainer back then was a Malaysian born. She prefers Malaysian because she felt that they were more committed to the airline and had stayed longer. I felt that she could have kept the comment to herself even if the comment might be true base on her observation. The company rationale for hiring foreigners are such that there will be a local speaking crew in every flight. So if the plane is flying to Japan, there should be a Japanese speaking crew. So hiring of foreigners are not due to being anti-Singaporeans but there is a real business need. But I really wonder how many % of the crews are foreigners. And for promotion, would nationality be an important criteria for consideration? And if there are more foreigners being promoted, and people tends to be bias to people of their own nationality, would the culture be more favourable to foreigners in the long run.-#97382: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97382",17,7,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have been very understanding and patient with him especially when he is in NS now. We hardly have time to talk because he is always tired (he is in ST) whenever he dismount too. He would take naps during his breaks and we hardly even have a 10 min conversation daily. Sometimes when he is upset, he would cancel our plans and make plans with his friends instead.

I am a sensitive person and may overthink like maybe two weeks of less conversation as compared to usual long chats, I would wonder is it his interest is fading.

What surprises me is, during an occasion when I didn't display my doubts, he still assures me. I am quite interested in him because I realize that during the day whenever I came across something interesting, sad or happy I would want to send him, but of course at times I will hold back because I do not want to disturb his busy work.

#97372,17/4/2021,"Hi all(kind souls on the net), need some help with insurance matters.My mom went for a type of heart surgery(balloon angioplasty) some time back and I just found out that her insurance company denied the hospital claims saying that she has got heart disease before. But the thing is she never had any Doctors told her she’s got any heart diseases before the surgery took place? It’s the first time anyone even told her she has got heart disease before and it’s the insurance agent. The Insurance Agent said she went to check with the hospital for my mom’s health records and told her that her hospital claim for the surgery was not possible because of her prior health records. Only simple verbal conversations to tell her it’s a no-go and the case is done. How is this allowed and possible? My mom herself went to the hospital to dig for her records too to want to find out more but was only given some charts that only Doctors can read and understand. There are no written reports to state if she have had any heart related diseases before. Now she has to pay for the full amount of hospital fees despite being insured with relevant insurance policies. So she’s been paying all these years to the insurance company for nothing? I’m ready to call up/visit the hospital to ask for more reports for proof. Please let me know what I can do to help her. She’s very stressed out but did not want to burden me that’s why I only just found out about this by accident.

I thought about the whole situation logically and I do realized that the age doesn't matter anymore but when I weigh out the pros and cons of chasing him, more cons appeared I realized he might just be flirting with me cos I'm someone new in the team and now that time has past, we are getting further and further away. The both of us are at different stages in life (I'm a fresh grad while he is still in studying in ite) and dating would seem hard at this point.

#97332,17/4/2021,"Tldr- should I reject a guy who looks significantly different from his pics on a dating app?Recently I got matched to this guy on a dating app. A big part on why I swiped him is that he has that k drama star look. We chatted via whatsapp for about a week and found that we click pretty well. He soon asked me out and we will be meeting for dinner in a few day’s time. The problem is this, I just found out by chance about his very recent pics from other sources. Tbh, I was surprised and disappointed at the same time about how he looked. We exchanged ig and I saw that his dating app pics were taken 2-3 years back. His ig has not been updated regularly since then and most of his pics were of scenery and group pics where his face is too small to be seen. While he looked cute and vibrant back then, his face has become much rounder, his hair has thinned and he aged quite a fair bit. He’s a high achiever at work and I think it might be his job stresses that cause him to age but still I’m really disappointed. If he has used his current pics, I’d have passed him over srsly. At this stage, should I ghost him straight? Or should I go for the dinner and see, then decide if to ghost him afterwards?-#97332: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97332",80,7,0,0,43,29,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#97325,17/4/2021,"I am getting married in a few months to the love of my life. We are a few years apart (less than a decade) but it has come with it's challenges due to the age gap. Whilst my family has been very supportive and has advised me constantly on how marriage is and the values needed to sustain a formidable and sustainable marriage, my partner's family have created many issues for her. I am decently established in my career, working towards a trajectory of growth and my family has been nothing but forthcoming to my fiancée and her family. I have been long trying to find some level of acceptance with her family but it has been very challenging and disrespectful on their end. Even discussions about a banquet or customs become hostile towards me and especially towards my parents. I love her a lot and she has been through enough with her own family as it is. All I want to do is work on giving her a better life but a part of me sinks that I will never gain acceptance from my in laws and the other part of me is broken that my parents had to go through such levels of disrespect. My partner has affirmed me that we will not look back once we sign that dotted line and we have promised each other to continue watering our plant of marriage to attain bliss and happiness.But a part of me needs healing and I'd appreciate some advice on how I can heal better from all the hurt, berating, insult and demeaning and close that chapter.

#97317,17/4/2021,"Admins plz plz do not filter...I’m asking for advice. Long story short there is this girl that I’m friends with and used to have feelings for, but she’s attached now to someone else. I’m happy to just stay in the sidelines and continue to be that good friend to her. But one thing that’s been bugging me is that I became more and more aware that her boyfriend is not exactly what he seems over time. It’s not like he committed any grave acts, but it’s multiple small things that I find questionable - just a few egs. 1. My friend is devout in her religion and only wants a bf that truly believes in the same. Although he tells her he believes, and accompanies her to her gatherings all the time, there are just signs that he doesn’t truly believe that myself and a select few others have noticed. 2. My friend feels strongly against porn. Her bf watches porn all the time but she is not aware as he keeps quiet about it. His mentality is what she doesn’t know wouldn’t hurt her?? 3. One of my friends knows his ex gf, and whilst he doesnt show it obviously, he is quite money minded, based on what was told to me at the very least. One of the reasons they (he and ex) broke up was because he couldn’t see a comfortable future with her and constantly brings up comments about this every now and then about how she needs to work harder in uni since her family isn’t well off, which the ex couldn’t take any more - and concurrently, was confiding in her close friends about her issues with him (who were both male), and then broke up with him eventually. But he now cites that they’ve broken up because she was interested in one of her male close friend? This friend of mine comes from a wealthy family and I don’t want her to be made used of, even indirectly. I think the question I’ve got is, should I tell her these small things or not? What’s holding me back is I do not wish to ruin our long-standing friendship, and if she believes him instead of me, I’ll probably never see her again. Furthermore, I don’t want her to get the impression like I’m making these comments because i used to have feelings for her (which she knows) and that I am trying to ruin their relationship. I’ve thought about just leaving things be for quite a few months now but it’s starting to bother me more as they are potentially planning for a wedding early next year. I don’t want my friend to find out about all this after she gets married but at the same time I risk losing a friendship I really care about with her still potentially proceeding on and then finding out this crap is true later.

#97313,17/4/2021,"To OP #97251: I used to date someone who was the same as your girlfriend. This person I was dating was depressed and had suicidal thoughts. At first I was very supportive, did everything I could in my power to help him; constantly being there for him, driving all the way to his house to pick him up, bringing him out just so to lift up his mood and so much more. He did go for therapy. He was under medication but even then, he was constantly down, always had depressive & suicidal thoughts. Eventually, I decided enough was enough. I am not here to treat him to become better. I am not his therapist, I am his girlfriend. I had to take care of my own mental health as it was taking a huge toll on my health and so, I broke up with him. He threatened that he was going to commit suicide, called me names, kept pestering but I did not budge. If he had wanted to kill himself, he wouldn’t have threatened me. Anyway, after I left him, I finally felt a huge relief. I was so much happier, I worked on myself and became a much happier person.

#97306,17/4/2021,"TLDR: Am i the only one who things chewing noises makes my skin crawl?I used to not care when people chew loudly, up till a point when i noticed i have been chewing with my mouth open. Since then, I’ve always chewed with my mouth close and got super sensitive when people around me chew super loudly. Problem is that my parents chew super loudly and i have asked them nicely if they could chew with their mouth closed. My mom’s response is that “she is born like that, she is born in the year of rat so she eats like one. And also she have been eating like that since i was young, why should she change? Why i start to find her annoying?” And my dad’s response is that “he have been eating like that since young, nobody taught him to eat with his mouth closed”. It takes a mental toll on me as my skin crawls every time i eat with them and get goosebumps and feel really uncomfortable. To cope with it, i tried to plug ear piece to block out the sound of them chewing. That also caused me to not be able to hear them talk, which my mom gets mad at. How can i get some therapy or anything as i really cant deal with the sound of my parent’s constant chewing noise, its really loud and the lips smacking is just bad. I can even hear my mom chewing from the dining room when i am in my bed room with the doors closed. I dont want to be rude, so i really hope theres some solutionAny advice from Prof Ben?

#97298,17/4/2021,"I met my bf (or ex for now) through dating app. He is a PhD student in NUS and I am working full time. Initially when we got together, we would try to do all things together and spend times together. But recently because he needed to study for his exam so he stopped seeing me, and the only time we would talk is during the night time before we sleep, for only around 10 minutes. Usually if there’s nothing important, he wouldn’t message me during the day time also, I was told by him not to message him so often as it will distract him from studying. Recently things got worse when we fought over the phone, we patched things up after that, but within a week he broke my heart and told me that “I didn’t have the mood to see you now cause I really need the time to study.” But I merely need 10 mins of his time, and I am suggesting to go to his place instead of asking him to come over. I asked around my friends who got a bf/gf and they all said they would always make time for each other, and their frequency of meet up is at least once per week, while I didn’t even get to see him till his exam is over. And before that, our meeting is once every two week (after the honeymoon phase). I already told him that I don’t mind going to somewhere near him to meet him, and I only need 2 hours of his time per week and I still don’t understand why he can’t make time for me. I still like him very much but I couldn’t do this anyone, so I told him over the phone last night that we are not compatible for each other and we should break up, and I am sorry that I break up with him one month before his exam, and I hope he is not too emotional influenced by that. I initially wanted to break up with him after his exam, but few days ago he messaged me and told me that he wanted to get married with me, while I at that stage, is planning for a break up. So I decided that I should not drag it any longer. He said he still like me and didn’t want me to leave, and we will break up temporarily for now till his exam is over, and we could talk it out after that. I just didn’t know if my decision is correct? Should I break up completely or should I stick with him?

#97295,17/4/2021,"I have dated my bf for approx 1.5 yr. As a carefree person, i agreed to bto with him and we got a unit which requires a lease of agreement to be signed soon.I come from a very physically abusive family and while i am mostly cheerful and happy, the truth is, i have ptsd from the severe beatings and i do suffer from suspected high functioning depression (Dr's suspicion). My doctor cried when i told her what i went through and how i feel it affects me even in adulthood, and frankly, i felt quite pathetic and damaged. Certain Triggers will cause me to go into attack mode where i may lash out or be physically violent if cornered due to some traumatic experiences in the past. I spent a goood portion of my life trying to build everything back up and face my inner demons and for once, i feel as though, i managed to get a stable footing.My bf is from a happy stable family. Everytime we fight, i have told him multiple times (100x) to just give in to me, hong me and if need be discusd another time where i have cooled off. I also requested that he does not do my triggers that will cause me to feel frightened and act out.Yet he fails to. Recently, our fights have escalated to violent scuffles (he intimidates me, i act out when i feel threatened and he hits back violently). I recognise that this is not a healthy relationship anymore. Despite multiple talks on changes during fights, ie. I wanted him to be the bigger man and just give in when i am mad, so that things would not escalate, and talk about it when i have cooled off. I wanted him to stop saying paggro and hurtful stuff during fights. I wanted him to be understanding that not every fight, he has to make a point to me, even as i am there crying and pleading. I wanted him to keep promises to me and not be physically violent to me (even if i act out). He would kick chairs and tables when we argue because he is angry.He couldn't. He kept doing the same things that puts me in uncomfortable, hurt and painful positions. Other than this, he is perfectly ok and spoils me.I am at a loss as the bto payment date is upcoming. I have recognised that he is likely not the guy that can love and respect me (with all my baggages and pain) and probably is not emphathetic enough to my trauma. He doesn't want to cancel the house and wants to try and continue (tbh, he keeps changing his mind and im unsure what he really wants). He has called in to postpose the date to give us a longer runway. He has called into counselling hotlines upon my insistence but the violent tendencies is still there. He told me many times that he wishes to change so that we can have a future. But everytime things escalate, he goes back into the same actions. Longest he ever maintained a change was for 8 days. I find him very immature for his age in the sense that he always feels that he needs to argue and win, even as i tried bringing up things to him by stating that ""When you do this, it hurts me..."" etc etc. I cannot handle his defensiveness or need to argue, anymore. I recognise that i am not the normal girl like others and i am ""damaged"" in a way, despite me successfully hiding it on the surface. Yet i am pretty certain that this is not how i want to live my life. I do not wish to have my hard work, in trying to carve out a normal life as much as possible, to be down the drain. And for me to lapse back into depression.My friends are split, one camp feels that i shld think more on the longer runway, the other calls for immediate end now. Ultimately, the final decision is my call. Should i insist on the house termination since violence has occurred ? Or should i take time to reconsider upon this longer runway?I do love him, but i feel that a short term pain is better than a lifetime of abusive relationship, as i was in a abusive family and i do not wish to continue in a potentially abusive marriage.-#97295: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97295",135,23,0,31,0,54,0,35,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, there were some issues with my beau being an Indian of India national and 8 years older, and I'm from a local Chinese family with traditional values. I met him on my first job and he was my tech lead at that time. He had a dad bod and rich Indian accent that is hard to understand, coupled with this cheekopek look - as if he is checking out every single angle of me, I was really disgusted with this pervert at that time. However, me being fresh out of uni with some fire in me to seek career growth and with some confidence in me from my list of suitors since uni time, I tried seducing him in hopes that I can have a smoother route up the corporate ladder. I eventually succeeded and we hooked up. Our relationship started off as a fwb thing to me but little did I know that it was actually true love to him, as we progressed I also started falling for him. While he is definitely a cheekopek when in bed with me, at every other time, standing beside the petite me, he is like my friendly dark brown teddy bear which I just feel so comfortable and so warm with. I had recently accepted his marriage proposal and I am now cohabiting with him at his rented condo which he is working to buy off as our love nest after our marriage. We should be able to do so comfortably with both our salaries. He is happy to settle down with me in SG, as he plans to bring his parents over and has no plans to return to India.

However it might affect my reputation if my gf is seeing other men, its fine if we are FWB status, but not when we are official.All the little bits are starting to build up despite multiple talks to resolve conflictsI feel like I am being blackmailed to continue this relationship , but at the same time,there is nothing bad by staying around to get pampered all the time.All I need to do is humor her once in awhile, and even if we fought , things get resolved fast probably because she just wants to keep me around.I do not think we would last very long if this keeps up, but is it right for me to carry on enjoying the benefits while it lasts, while she lives her dream life with me? Its a win-win situationOr should I end it before it gets any deeper and free myself up for an actual relationship.Given her emotional instability,she might make a big deal out of it or fall into depression if I decide to breakup with her, it would be difficult to get off the stage.

However, recently I have been thinking twice about applying for new corporate job because no matter what jobs I'm trying to apply, it feels like I'm self-sabotaging, giving all sorts of excuse to reject interviews. I think my previous job has really left such a great impact on me, and I just can't seem to be more positive in this job seeking. If I don't look for corporate jobs, my degree will be simply a waste and I have a study loan to pay.. Any kind soul can give me some advice as I'm really lost.. I have tried to look for sales jobs, HR jobs, marketing jobs, BD jobs.. But either I'm underqualified or I realized that's not what I want. I will constantly think, what if I join a company that has toxic environment again?  The process of joining-resigning is really exhausting. How long should I give myself for this job hunt?-#97283: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97283",39,8,0,3,0,21,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
#97281,17/4/2021,"Am in a relationship with a surgeon recently. We don't meet up very often because he's busy at work and I have my own commitments like studying and hobbies. But mostly because he's busy, if I want to be honest with myself lol. So he's a really nice person but he kept disappearing? We would be texting and halfway through, he'd let me know that he has to go perform an operation. Then he will not reply until 2 days later! I try to be understanding. Afterall, he did let me know that he'd be in the operation theatre but... for 2 days? Am I unreasonable if I hoped that after washing up he'd at least text to update me or continue our conversation? Usually after 2 days, he'd just start a new conversation, like ""Hi, how's your day today"" and when I ask about his, he will talk about his work as if it was something that happened days back. Not like, ""oh I just ended a 48 hour surgery"".Other than that, it's been going great. We had fun dates and we text and talk on the phone like normal couples. I haven't dated a doctor/surgeon before and I am wondering if I have underestimated how busy they are. Any medical students/ doctors/ surgeons or people in a relationship with one want to shed light on this? I'm still early in the relationship and if he is indeed being sketchy I won't want to continue this. If not, I would love to try to be more understanding towards him!

#97269,17/4/2021,"My gf always resorts to lies and false accusations to ""win"" whenver we argue. I have tried many times to tell her this is not only not constructive, it just creates new problems. However, just by telling her this will trigger her as in her mind, she must always ""win"" every fight. It is really exhausting for me. Some more these accusations being false, just hurt me deeply everytime. It really affects me badly.So if we disagree on anything, or if she said something offensive or hurtful to me, just me politely and factually stating this will result in a multi-hour or multi-day fight. I honestly do not understand how come she reacts like this and over the last thirty months together, have tried all kinds of ways to communicate with her, be it more nicely, more politely, different tone, whatever, but the result always the same. I won't even be able to get 1 single sentence in once she starts her rants which can easily become an hour long monologue of her yelling and repeating at me. I mean she won't even let me respond even if she ask me a question? I will say two words to respond and then she will talk louder over me. I will wait for her to rant for an hour, then try to get one sentence in, only for her to tell me I am rude by talking over her.Despite the above, she will gaslight me like crazy and tell me I have anger management issues, because I am upset at the above. I asked her not to gaslight me. She then told me I am a gaslighter and even said her only fault is getting together with me, all other faults are mine in the past thirty months. I said let's be reasonable, in any couple, if one belives in thirty months, that party has zero fault in every quarrel, surely that party is not being honest. She disagreed and repeats her rants in response.When we are not fighting she is a very nice and fun person but little things trigger her and she becomes the monster above.

#97257,17/4/2021,"I am a 35/M and I went to a top secondary school and JC in Bishan.I grew up around teenagers who prided themselves on their academic performance, on their CCA performance, and believed strongly that they will become highly successful people in the future. I had 2 classmates in JC, now best friends, who told me that they will hit a million dollars in annual salary by the time they reach 35, both of whom went to Oxbridge. Every single straight-A type that I knew had this air of arrogance around them, because I truly believe that they believed that they were better than the rest of us, that they will unerringly turn out to be more successful than any of us.There was this girl I met in J1. She was a quiet girl who was from a neighborhood secondary school who happened to be in the same OG and class as I was. She was really timorous, really shy. She didn't have the best grades, and was notorious for skipping CCA. I was always confused by how nonchalant she was about schoolwork, how she always copies my homework, and how I have never once seen her studying. She eventually retained, and I lost contact with her.I was recently having coffee alone at a cafe. She was fiddling around with the POS system. I recognized her immediately because she looked exactly the same as she did in JC. She did her hair up the same way. I approached her to say hello, and she told a younger girl to make her a flat white, and she came to sit with me at my table. We started chatting about the old days, and I found out she got BCCC/B at A-levels, and did business at SMU. It also turns out that she owns the cafe, along with 13 other F&B establishments in Singapore and JB. Her share of the profits in 2018? 2.7 million. I was speechless for a while. Meanwhile my friends who went to Oxbridge, one of whom on a PSC scholarship, are now civil servants, both earning just a little between 10-15K a month. That's a good salary, but I was mediocre in JC (ABBC/A) and even I am earning more than 15K as a management consultant.We have created a system of flawed meritocracy where children are brought up believing that just because you are the best in school, you're always going to be best in life. The logic is flawed because being the best in school just means you're going to be ""good"" in life. In most cases, you're just as likely as anyone to become ""great."" If we think about it, kids become great in school because they understand the system well, and because there is generally a very clear methodology to become great. As long as you don't challenge the system, as long as you work within the ""rules,"" you'll come out on top. In the real world, there are several lines of work in which it is valuable to be able to work well within a system. The SAF for example. Probably explains why the word ""scholar"" always gets paired up with ""general"" in Singapore.I think we, as a nation, need more humility when we think that the best people in school deserve more praise than any other student. People are good at different things, and school, being able to follow instructions to the hilt, is just one thing.-#97257: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97257",300,1300,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So he asked if want to have another one, i rejected but he insisted to put give it to me. I reluctantly accepted. It was weird that he didn’t drink the wine at all but I didn’t think much because I have met him several times alone. Later I fainted without knowing. I was heavily drugged that I couldn’t really move myself or pull myself t wake up. So he started his act and I caught a few glimpse of what happen but I couldn’t move myself.

#97162,17/4/2021,"Hi, looking for advice.I'm at a crossroads & idk how to proceed into the next part of my journey. I've worked in sales all my life so I'm used to high pay, flexible (actly long) hours. I like my current job, good at it, clients are happy with me usually. But recently company has undergone a lot of changes and team dynamics have changed. Manager has become toxic, we don't even talk anymore. When we do in official communications, she makes it a point to 'lose my face' & shame me in front of other ppl. Tldr: it's time for me to leave. R/s is beyond repair at this point. I have 2 job offers from 2 friends now who hold me in high regard and know what I'm capable of. One is IT sales. One is corporate sales. The problem is the IT sales job was offered to me before the guy who offered it to me ended up sleeping with me. It's nearing recruitment period and he's been trying to buy me a lot of gifts. Basic is abt $5-7/k (I forget, I was drunk) + handsome commissions although idk what the estimates are. Company is big and booming and has been able to take advantage of covid situation. However, when I looked at the website, I rly cannot figure out like what kind of IT service they provide so product knowledge curve is gna be steep for me. He was telling me I'd have to go out for dinners with clients. I guess the only uncomfortable part for me is the fact we slept tgt a few times. I don't even like him. We were just drunk, bored, and horny. I wish we didn't sleep tgt but can tell he will definitely take care of me. It's just that this can also go really badly and he pimps me out or sabotages my professional life bc of personal feelings. Anw... other job is a corporate sales job. Basic is $4.5k/mth with generous comms but only after first year. Product training provided. Currently, I'm getting $3k/mth basic so both options are still an upgrade. Average covid sales match my current job's pre-covid average sales. Current job has not been able to adapt in covid. Average is $100k comms/year. Best sales is $600k comms/year. Sick. Working environment is good. All male industry and except for my friend who offered me the job, the other men are married, but this friend and I are platonic.I'm in a dilemma bc pre covid I used to rake in $120k/annum as a fresh grad in my current job but since covid hit, I'm barely hitting 30% of that. Most months maybe only 15% of that. Sucks... If I leave, I have to pay $20k penalty fee for contract severance. The only reason I stayed in this job is cos I don't wna pay the severance fee but after finding these 2 jobs, I'm seriously considering switching. Should I take the IT sales job or the corporate sales job tho? Have to send in my resume in next few days.

#97159,17/4/2021,"Need advice here !Tldr - My boyfriend's sister doesn't quite like me, couldn't really pinpoint as to what I have done wrong for her to have such a reaction towards me.I've been dating this man for almost a year and a half now. He is honestly nothing but sweet to me and I couldn't ask for anything better. He is my first official relationship but I am not his first. Everything is good between the two of us except that I have a little fear of going to his house because... his older sister doesn't quite like me.Just to give a little more context, whenever I go over to his house, I would always greet everyone, of course, that includes his sister no less. I would always buy enough food over for everyone which includes his sister's boyfriend as well. However, I was constantly met with cold shoulder or just a ""mmm"" whenever I was over. When I was invited to my boyfriend's house for the first time, I figured maybe she was just being awkward with me granted that that was the first time we met. But even after a year in, no matter how hard I tried talking to her, she would best give me a two words reply, if my boyfriend isn't near me, it would be met with silence and she would just turn away and walk back to her room.Before you all think that it is probably her personality, I thought so as well. Until my boyfriend invited over some of his friends for his birthday celebration and I saw the stark difference in her treatment towards his friends and towards me. You can imagine my face of disbelief when I heard her cracking jokes with his friends.After that party, it really did bother me quite a bit. However, I didn't want to share it with my boyfriend because then he would definitely confront his sister on that, and I wouldn't want to make his sister hate me even more! So I decided to ask my boyfriend a little more about his sister and he revealed that she was quite close to his ex (my boyfriend dated her for close to 5 years). So then I thought, she must have really treated my boyfriend's ex as her own sister, which it is understandable why she was so hostile towards me, now that I have ""replaced"" that spot. It didn't help when I found out that his sister is still in contact with his ex. Considered that my boyfriend did not really break up with his ex on good terms, and she had attempted  to get back with him, maybe his sister is trying to help her out? I don't want to speculate too much but I am also not a confrontational person. I can't just go over and ask her why she didn't like me when she barely even want to acknowledge me. I have tried many other means such as buying her gifts during x'mas, gave her handwritten cards, baked cupcakes for her (she loves pastry). At this point, I am really running out of ideas on what I should do next. It's been a year and I still can't figure it out! Please, I really need advice. Not a troll post...

#97133,17/4/2021,"I am lost at what to do. I grew up in a toxic environment where I was physically, mentally and emotionally abused. My father is a narcissist who thinks the world must worship him. He used to make my siblings and I do things against our wish i.e. dancing stupidly in front of him or other worst things for his entertainment purposes. And we’d be bawling our eyes out to make him stop but he wouldn’t and eventually gets angry and slap hard across our faces and said things like “get out of the room, I hate to see your face”. It got worst when I reached my teenage years. I got slapped so hard I couldn’t hear properly on one ear, kicked while I was lying on the floor because I wouldn’t stop crying from his slaps, called my friends to ask my whereabouts because he didn’t trust my words, threatened to hire PI to watch my moves etc. The list is endless. All this happened while my mother was watching whom we classify as an enabler. She could’ve and had that power to stop him because I have seen how fierce she could get with him if she didn’t get what she wanted but she did not stop him from raising his hands and voice at us. It came to a point where sleeping soundly was so scary because I’ll never know when he’d budge in to scream at me startling me from my sleep. The side effects from it now is I startle whenever I hear voices suddenly with my back turned or if someone touches me. I am in my 30s now and never had a boyfriend because of all the manipulative things they have done to me and the trauma I went through. I was always seeking their validation and approval that I forgo my own happiness and they started taking advantage of my generosity such as my time and money. I did not realise how toxic they were until recently, something triggered that all the childhood experiences came flooding through and I remembered all of it like it happened yesterday. I am still living with them and planning to rent an apartment because I am extremely unhappy with them. Not just my parents but my siblings too. I’m no longer talking to any of them and it’s hell. I do talk to my mom like nothing happened but inside I am reeling. Now, the question is, how do go none contact when I move out? Has anyone done it? Singapore is so tiny, I might bump into them and my relatives and I wouldn’t know how to react. I hate my family so much, there is no more love but hatred for what they have done to me. So to invite them over to my house for prayers or gathering seems hypocritical and I do not want them appearing at my door suddenly. I am also afraid they would depend on my for money and try all ways to keep in touch with me. They are also manipulative and could cry on command that I am grateful and how could I do this to them (when I reduced the allowance by $100) when all my life I was scraping to buy my own clothes and paid for my own diploma and degree.

#97126,17/4/2021,"TLDR; Do you think that Singapore has no more cards to play and is facing its decline? Lately, our news cycle seem to show that all that we are doing is to sit on the fence over the Sino-US conflict and about us welcoming Globalism as our way of life by sucking up whatever fart the west put out, in hopes to gain some from them through FTAs. (Think about those multiculturalism/ pro-immigration, environmentalism and feminism bullsh!t) Anyone agrees that SG will somehow turn into the likes of Taiwan someday, where people are underemployed everywhere due to the abundance of degree holders and diminishing job opportunities? Or we will simply turn into ""California""; a state filled with immigrants, disenfranchised locals who wants to leave and a very wide wage margin, albeit the creation of jobs by some foreigners? It appears that we are doomed when we lose our edge in several niche industries, influx of white collar immigrants that does not necessarily create jobs for Singaporeans and the resultant falling TFR.Please feel free to expand my list, but it seems like the following industries are failing:- Semiconductors was lost after CSM lost the race against the Taiwanese, Koreans and Japanese- Aviation industry due to covid or probably even to countries like Thailand and Philippines that can easily set up bigger ""hubs"" than Saletar- Marine industry to many other developing countries, due to its low skill barrier- Ports from the many emerging ones in China and probably even Thailand- O&G due to the push for all those environmental these, climate change that narratives- Biotech that never really took off despite the billions spent on biopolis-#97126: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97126",37,2,0,0,7,36,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

He would attend zoom meetings occasionally, but would stay muted most of the time. Even if he does talk, it is merely repeating after other group members. Even after writing in to prof earlier on during the semester, this situation has not improved at all. For the entire semester, his only ""contribution"" is appearing in the presentation video (which had an individual graded component btw). He is also from IDP if that matters.

However, today was different from any other day. Sneaky heard the sound of an Arabic music. It then followed the direction of where the music was coming from. As Sneaky got closer to the source of the music, the image of a bulky and tanned man began to surface. He was none other than HE. He was dancing happily in tandem with the Arabic music. Suddenly, there was a loud growl in Sneaky’s stomach. Sneaky was feeling extremely hungry as he saw HE dancing and smiling to himself. Then, an idea materialised in Sneaky’s mind. It decided to carry out the idea in its mind.Sneaky was feeling puzzled. HE was an obvious Eastern Asian Man yet he dressed like Aladdin with an awfully looking moustache. To carry out its idea, Sneaky proceeded to join him in the dance by moving its head along with the HE’s dance movement. Seeing Sneaky was moving along with his dance movement, HE was filling with joy. He felt that he was finally  able to influence living things around him. Feeling confident that he was able to influence Sneaky further, he decided to do something more risky. He descended his lip till it was few inches away from the head of Sneaky and did several dance moves involving his lip in close distance with Sneaky. Little did he know about the sneaky idea in Sneaky.As HE lips inched closer, Sneaky sprang forward to bit HE’s lips. Upon making contact, Sneaky injected all the poison from his fangs into HE. HE was caught by surprised as his dance usually would mesmerise snakes and will not cause it to attack. HE’s vision turned blurry as he started to succumb to the effects of the poison. As he lied on the ground, he saw a figure moving towards him.It was the Princess, well known for her benevolent and kind heart. Slowly but yet meticulously, she moved HE’s head onto her lap. At this moment, HE had passed out and his lip had turned completely black, just like the colour of charcoal. She knew that if no antidote was given to him within half an hour, HE would die. Princess knew that her physician had an antidote which was able to treat any poison. However, to get back to the palace, it would take exactly half an hour too.

He texts me good morning every day and was always the one to initiate a conversation. It was going so well when he suddenly just started ignoring me.

I don’t think I’m a dry texter at all and I have no idea how he could change this quickly when we were having consistent conversations.

Only saying hi in the same module and when she needed help, calling and expecting that I pick up to hear her rant about her stuff. Saying things like ""oh if I knew you were going to SEP to this place earlier, I would have applied to go with you"" and ""I'm always here if you need me!"" but poof! Disappears when I drop in texts to check on her while on SEP, short answers to my reply on her ig stories, etc. The difference is that she was emotionally clingy and isn't a player per se, but just a popz kid hanging out with anyone else.I cut her off basically everywhere. We only have a finite amount of emotional energy so we should spend it most selectively. Helping others is fine but not letting other people leech infinitely.

#97103,17/3/2021,"I’d appreciate some thoughts on this issue I’m currently facing.Last year in June (when COVID-19 was at its peak), my friend got retrenched from her job and borrowed $500 from me because she was financially tight and needed money to pay off some bills. I did not think much into it at that time because 1) She’s a very good friend and 2) I’d help with whatever I can help with.She found a job in January 2021 and said that she could finally return me my $500. Fast forward to April 2021, she still has not returned the $500.I did not pressure her about returning the money last year because she was jobless and I did not want to add on to her stress. However, when I reminded her about returning the $500 in February and March, she told me to give her more time as she is financially tight. I don’t get it… she now has a job with stable income now but still unable to return me my $500. I even told her that she could pay pay bit by bit, maybe $50 or $100 at a time, whatever is within her means to pay the money back slowly. However, she told me she would prefer paying back the $500 at one shot. Here’s the funny thing, she claims she is financially tight, but on her instagram stories, I see that she goes out for meals almost everyday (btw, she dines at cafes and restaurants), having drinks at a pub almost every week. If she is not doing well financially, is this the kind of lifestyle she should be leading?I raised this concern of mine to a few friends who are in the same clique as us. Some of them agreed on my viewpoint but some of them just went..“Aiya, you come from a rich family, $500 is peanuts to you..why you being so calculative?” Yes, I admit I come from a well to do family however, I have never seen my parents money as my money. It’s theirs and theirs alone. What they decide to do with it has nothing to do with me. My parents worked hard to get to where they are now so I don’t see why I should be living off them. Besides, I work hard for my own things as well. It doesn’t matter if I’m rich or not. What matters here is integrity. If you borrow money, be it $2, $20 or $200, have the bloody integrity to pay back the money you owe. What should I do now? I’m kinda at my wits end chasing this friend to payback the $500. Should I just let it go or keep pressurising her to return the $500?-#97103: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97103",16,7,0,4,0,43,0,7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

She is staying at the school hostel n about a few weeks back she got really sick. For some reason she decided to tell me about it. Told her to go see a doctor but she refused saying that it was at night n if she didnt get better by morning she would go see a doctor. Me being a concerned friend decided to get her some hot food n medicine. I decided to drop the stuff at the lobby n go home after. When we met at the lobby, she told me to follow her to her room. Initially i didnt want to as her floor is for females but after she convinced me saying a lot of guys come there too, i decided to follow her. We ate the food in the pantry area then i asked her to eat the medicine that i bought. I also gave her vicks n a blanket as she told me she was cold. Wanted to leave afterwards but she asked me to hang around for a bit since she was lonely.  We ended up playing some games on the nintendo n watch a movie on netflix in her room. Halfway through the movie she told me that she was getting sleepy so i turned it off n got ready to leave. It was around 2am at this time. She told me to sleep there first as it was late at night n its dangerous to drive back since i was also sleepy. I wanted to sleep at the common area but she told me to stay with her.So i slept on the floor in her room using her yoga mat n a cushion. I plan to wake up early the next day n sneak out of her room b4 anyone saw me but because we were both tired, we woke up around 11. She checked if there was anyone outside b4 i left her room then i left. Bumped into this girl at the lift when i was leaving but didnt think too much about it.

#97093,17/3/2021,"Notice a lot of posts about sexual compatibility in a relationship. Cant help but notice the double standard in the comments. When a male confessor said that he has a higher sex drive, a lot of the comments will be like go pcc/diy to satisfy ur needs. When a female confessor said the same thing, the comments would be like sexual compatibility is impt in a relationship. As someone who has been in both sexual n non sexual relationships, here r my thoughts. I think that sex is just another activity that u do with ur partner. Its like playing sports or watching a movie together. If u both enjoy doing it then good for u. Theres no min or max amount of times u have to do it. If u have different sex drives, u dont necessarily need to find a new person. Try talking it out n see why they have a different sex drive level. Maybe u can also experiment with toys etc. Lots of stuff u can research about online. Compromise n communication is key. Also as mention earlier masturbation is also an option. Intimacy doesnt have to be just through sex, there r a lot of other ways to be intimate with ur partner.

#97063,17/3/2021,"#97022: https://www.NUSWhispers.com/confession/97022Hi All,Thank you so much for your kind comments. Thank you admin for posting my story. I took a deep breath before reading it and cried in tears of happiness (I definitely cried alot, haha). Firstly I would like to address that I did not blame my parents for anything. Back on those days, I just feel really stressful that they were pushing me to get something that are not in my capability but also because of their perseverance, I have gotten a local diploma in Accountancy. Which I am very thankful of for the rest of my life. This is my biggest achievement. I remembered before my dad went for heart surgery last year and he cried to my mom saying that he was so worried about me or my future. Back then after knowing it, I am surprise because he never let me know all these. I felt very unfilial because among my other siblings, he worried about me alot. But I don't understand why? After all I still earn a decent diploma salary ($1,900-$2K), just not as highly educated as my siblings and wealth off. But I know my limit, I never feel like I was earning very little because I don't splurge and I only need to fed myself after giving them allowance.I have been working for 8-9 years now. I am still frequently ask by interviewer or head of the higher rank on ""why didn't I go and pursue a degree?"". And every time this question was asked, I can't answer it. Because I don't have any excuses. I didn't even tried taking the course and know I failed or gotten expelled but at least I tried. I find it a waste of money to study and dropped out. In fact, the 10 years time frame for a 12 modules Advance RMIT accountancy is coming to an end soon. Which means that I have to take all 24 modules next time. Since I have saved more than enough, I am considering if I should just take part time degree and don't think too much already. I am not ready for my mental health issue but I can't let it drag me or delayed me if I want to achieve it. My mom continued to convince me to try. The only thing is my friends find that part time studying and working is very tiring and too much distraction. And studying accountancy is really hard for me. The last time I studied diploma in accountancy, my weight has gone down alot. I am overly worried about not able to understand or do well or even my increasing worsen anxiety which led to the hesitation for so many years. I actually had a childhood goal being an accounting lecturer/tutor in ITE because ITE Nitec was the lowest point of my life. But because diploma was too hard for me, I eventually didn't get to go into a local uni. (My perspective during that time when I could not get in is actually bitter sweet, I am happy I finally freed myself from this endless study and can start going out working but also I know I've disappoint my parents). If I graduated with a private degree, I could probably go there and applied to work. Since I don't last long working full time accounting office job once things get really bored. I don't really care about the salary, I just want to get back to help people in their lowest point of life just like how my ITE lecturer helped me. My lecturer was also a nitec student previously but graduate from NUS degree. ITE lecturer has their own criteria for entry so maybe private degree cannot get in also. I cannot put too much hope in this career.Personally I think way too much and ended up not taking any steps because of my fear. These 9 years I've been debating, should I do it? Should I not? I envied people graduating because behind that certification is endless of determination and hard work. But some of my friends closer to me knowing my situation has told me if you can't commit, don't take it. They know I've come a long way in the education path. While people over their 30s are getting married and BTO or already with kids, I am still thinking of petty stuff like taking a degree. I really hate myself. I didn't want this to become a regret for not trying but I hate putting myself in a situation whereby I ended up suffering tremendous stress just like how I did in my poly days. My dad wants me to be in good health and happy, so he stopped asking me to get a degree. He know I stop eating and cried frequently, once I get too stressful. While my mom feel like I should try 1 sems and see how it goes. What should I do? :((-#97063: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97063",15,0,0,15,0,7,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#97062,17/3/2021,"(Admin please don’t filter this out) Hi guys,I am about to graduate from my overseas university international program (SIM-UOL). Based on last year, my seniors took more than 1 year to receive the certificate because of the covid situation in London. However, they did well for their previous (year 1 and year 2) modules and received before their final exam. On the other hand, I didn’t do well in my previous (year 1 and year 2) modules as I was coping school with part time job. I am wondering when do graduates in my similar position apply for their jobs? A. Do you wait for your exam results for your final year exam to be out before applying for jobs?B. Do you apply for jobs right after your final year exams (before the results are out)?C. Do you wait until you have received your degree certificate to apply for job? Out of the three options, which is most preferred by employers and likely to reap better results (getting an offer, better compensation package etc)?-#97062: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97062",4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

I'm single and live with my mum, and my aunt lives nearby and comes over for meals. Mum is still ok but now is starting to depend on me for more things. My aunt deliberately moved near us for a convenient arrangement. Taking the MRT is not an option as I can't wake up early enough. Changing jobs is not an option. My options are: 1) Taxi or PHV - the journey is 30 mins but sometimes I get stressed out when the vehicle takes too long to arrive, typically causing me to arrive minutes to spare before the starting time. PHV drivers have ever cancelled on me. 2) Buy a car and drive in the morning  - the driving is 30 mins but even entry-level models are expensive3) Show up the night before and sleep in office - I have a safari bed and sleeping bag at my workstation and access is via access card. Company has not said that I can't stay overnight. There are shower facilities as well. The disadvantage is that I need to have my access card with me if I go to the toilet or shower, i.e. consequences of forgetting that access card when going to pee is quite disastrous. 4) Rent a room 2-3 MRT stops away - this reduces my commute but the problem is getting my family to come to terms with this decision, due to the situation at home. Also, it is not everyday that I have to show up early to work. 5) Buy a flat 2-3 MRT stops away - this also reduces my commute, but gives me extra headache for renovation and similar problem with family accepting this decision. 6) Book a hotel room nearby whenever I need to - this is at least $100 per night for a room ...

Please don't filter.So recently, I met a semi deaf guy who was buying a pair of hearing aids as the previous seller that sold him ONE hearing aid sold him the most expensive piece he could afford. That bloody seller sold him just ONE piece when he needed TWO of it and told him to buy one side first, and when he saved up enough, he can go to him to buy the next side. LIKE SERIOUSLY? This type of money also good to earn? That poor deaf guy was working his ass off. I cannot believe there are seller like that. They are selling a necessity not a want item. How can they be so heartless? That poor guy is not even rich and he had to live with that stupid hearing aid that doesn't even help him at all for a few years. Imagine all the agony he had to live with. And wearing 1 hearing aid when he needed 2 is bad for his ear.Anyway, thank god he went to this brand (not here to promote the brand, so not going to mention the name), the consultant told ask him what is his budget and recommended him A PAIR that suits his budget and needs. Even though it was one of the cheapest pair, the consultant even spent time to slowly explain to him to the functions and what not. And even told him that there are hearing aids for all budgets. Doesn't mean the most expensive ones are the best. Guys, please spread the words, majority of the hearing aids consultants are salesman. They earn by commission. So if you happen to have a deaf relative or friend, please do get them to seek at least 2 opinions from different company before spending a bomb on hearing aids.-#97045: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97045",13,34,0,33,0,181,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Was rejected by a role that I was pinning my hopes on.Failed around 6 government job interviews, including some that I was quite confident in (relevant skillset and experience). Some (HR, panel) were kind enough to let me know that other applicants are more experienced. Which is not surprising cos some did not pay much attention to me during the interview. But it seems that it is not my interviewing skills either - one was quite impressed with my enthusiasm. I wonder if other fresh grads are experiencing the same? Understand that market is very bad and I heard that some are not even getting interviews - in that aspect, is it safe to say that I am quite lucky...? I have some that are still pending, some that I have yet to attend. Sometimes, I think that it may be because of my written assessments.

I even question my worth, and wonder if I am even worthy enough to apply for the government.I am really very dejected at this point and wonder if I should stop applying for the government sector and focus my time on the private sector instead, or try out internships and traineeships. I even wonder if I should just take up any SME job that comes by but pays below 3000. It is a pity as I am genuinely interested in the government sector for my first job. At this rate, I may really be swallowed by the disappointment and tiredness from applying for government jobs that demanded for numerous intense assessments.

When I went for interview, my interview was kinda fast game kind, it was like a 5-10min thing, maybe it's normal maybe not, im not sure. but yeah i gotten the job next day, so i had to go back to the HQ to get agreement signed, when i was signing that agreement i asked the HR if uniform was provided and she said there isn't my size (she didn't even ask me what size i was wearing) then i was kinda blur if uniform was provided cause i asked her if I should come back and take my uniform and she said no. but still, i think that company should have atleast a blazer or whatsoever uniform, so i texted her and she told me that there isn't any uniform. (that's 1st)Because as a recieptionist at the Beauty Industry usually they do have telemarketing also where you cab start earning commission, so I asked the HR if there's commission and she said no (that's 2nd) I asked if light make up is needed she said no too, as now we have to wear mask no one can see it either (that's 3rd)Now that I started working the CEO came down to the outlet and ask me why am i not wearing their uniform? why didn't i put make up? like huh?? your HR told me all this is a no need oh and ya when i went to the HQ the third time because the HR remember that she didn't issue any uniform to me when i went to try it doesn't fit me and she ask me to buy my own at the company and expect me to give $100 deposit (fyi. those who gotten the uniform from the company have to deposit$100) but thank god i did not, but well in the end she told me that office say no need to buy uniform just wear full black now that the CEO said why didn't i have any uniform .. can someone please explain to me if this is normal? it's totally bullshit tho .. i had enough honestly and i ain't happy here, i just work here like 2-3 weeks only .. someone please tell me what to do, it's hard to find a job either.-#97037: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97037",6,0,0,1,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

#97031,17/3/2021,"The whole reason why a lot of Singaporeans still believe in the obligatory role of children as caregivers of their aging parents is a symptom of the hangover from our Chinese/Asian ancestry. The thing about culture is nobody actually questions it because we have all been raised to believe that all culture is sacrosanct. In fact, it’s not always the case. Cultures, like modern ideas of communism and capitalism, are just world views. Some of them make sense, most of them do not. There is nothing inherently valuable about preserving a particular culture. It might be useful to preserve specific values from many different cultures, but it makes no sense that the entirety of any culture can be said to be always good. At one point of time, slavery was a societal norm of a large group of people. At one point of time we had to live in fear of tyranny from imperialists. At one point of time, communism had resulted in the greatest event of starvation in the history of mankind. These are all cultures, and if we want to choose to deny the bad and only invite the good, then what’s the point in being a follower of a single culture if you’re just going to re-define it as you go? Isn’t it far more helpful to free your mind from the dogma of tradition and to make moral judgements about your actions based on modern definitions of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?Even though Singaporeans are generally well-educated, fundamentalism is rather rampant. If we were to abide strictly by the dictates of our Chinese culture, then we will find ourselves also believing in rather backward views about human rights. Gender inequality is massively problematic in Chinese culture. Many of our practices are also based not only on core Confucian values, but also of a complete lack of understanding of the scientific method. i.e A large number of us still believe Daoism is literally true. If we can’t get ourselves to question the wrongs in our cultures, how can we ever hope to progress as a country?-#97031: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97031",39,5,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
#97028,17/3/2021,"Hi all! I’d appreciate some thoughts on this issue I’m currently facing.Last year in June (when COVID-19 was at its peak), my friend got retrenched from her job and borrowed $500 from me because she was financially tight and needed money to pay off some bills. I did not think much into it at that time because 1) She’s a very good friend and 2) I’d help with whatever I can help with.She found a job in January 2021 and said that she could finally return me my $500. Fast forward to April 2021, she still has not returned the $500.I did not pressure her about returning the money last year because she was jobless and I did not want to add on to her stress. However, when I reminded her about returning the $500 in February and March, she told me to give her more time as she is financially tight. I don’t get it… she now has a job with stable income now but still unable to return me my $500. I even told her that she could pay pay bit by bit, maybe $50 or $100 at a time, whatever is within her means to pay the money back slowly. However, she told me she would prefer paying back the $500 at one shot. Here’s the funny thing, she claims she is financially tight, but on her instagram stories, I see that she goes out for meals almost everyday (btw, she dines at cafes and restaurants), having drinks at a pub almost every week. If she is not doing well financially, is this the kind of lifestyle she should be leading?I raised this concern of mine to a few friends who are in the same clique as us. Some of them agreed on my viewpoint but some of them just went..“Aiya, you come from a rich family, $500 is peanuts to you...why you being so calculative?” Yes, I admit I come from a well to do family however, I have never seen my parents money as my money. It’s theirs and theirs alone. What they decide to do with it has nothing to do with me. My parents worked hard to get to where they are now so I don’t see why I should be living off them. Besides, I work hard for my own things as well. It doesn’t matter if I’m rich or not. What matters here is integrity. If you borrow money, be it $2, $20 or $200, have the bloody integrity to pay back the money you owe. What should I do now? I’m kinda at my wits end chasing this friend to payback the $500.

#97024,17/3/2021,"Sharing some rs advice here that I'd wish I had known before.My bf and I are in long-term stable rs. In the initial phase of our rs, I initiated breakup few times cause I couldn't manage my emotions well and also had lots of insecurities. But he always pulled me back into the rs. Until one period he could not take the damage of my words and emotions that he said if I want to, we can. That was a wake-up call for me because I didn't want to lose him, I just did not know how to sit with the agony when things got rough and cowardly sought escape. After that, I never initiated. I constantly told myself, if this rs is important enough to me, I will not choose the ""easy"" way out.Fast forward to today, I still have some emotional issues and there are also some fundamental issues in our rs which is taking awhile to sort out. Few times, our arguments got so bad that he initiated breakup but relented after I promised to see a therapist. Thing is, I did not expect the act of initiating breakup can be so damaging to the rs and parties involved, until I got on the receiving end myself. So damaging that, even weeks after, I have repeated nightmares of him breaking up with me. I wake up shocked, I wake up crying, I wake up feeling so insecure and miserable sometimes. But I had to sit with the agony, because some part of me feels that I brought it upon myself. I started this whole breakup shit. I do hope seeing my therapist would help with this. And sometimes I wonder what unseen damage have I done to him back then, and I really hope he heals from it.The message I want to bring across is, initiating breakup, for whatever reason, is so damaging and you won't realize it until it's too late. At the point of bursting with frustration and helplessness, you may think, it's just few words. Let's see where it gets us. Maybe he/she will give in. Maybe he/she will feel sorry. Maybe I will feel better. But trust me, even if it seems to work for one or few times, it does long-term, permanent damage that you'd wish you had shut your mouth then. What worked for me, and I hope it works for you if you get into such a situation is, tell yourself to wait one day. Just wait. Exit the situation if you can't stand the atmosphere - tell him/her you need some space, go to another room, go grab Macs or just go do whatever you like. And if you still want to initiate breakup after one day, then have the conversation.And to anyone who hurt so bad from breakups or near-breakups, I hope you heal from it, however long it may take.-#97024: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97024",6,22,0,25,0,113,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

Hopefully admin can help me post this so I can get advice.Since young I've never excel in studies. I am always the student in the last class since young, I always find myself crying for lesson on the start of new school getting so stress up to try to cope with lesson, piles of difficult homework. When I bought my homework back home, my parents are unable to help me too because they are illiterate. Our family are not wealthy so despite my bad grades since young they will still opt for me to go home tuition or group tuition at CDAC. Eventually I still didn't get to do well and went to ITE Nitec. When I was signed up for ITE Nitec, I begged my parents not to let me continue study. Of course they didn't listen because a kid this young with only N level certificate cannot survive well in this society. I still cried every time I am in a new school, restless, unable to sleep, depressed which seems unusual as this symptom continued. Eventually I finished my ITE Nitec and was offered a Higher Nitec with the help of my home tuition and a good CCA, GPA 3.5 in total I was offered to get inside a well-known full time polytechnic. My parents was elated but for me it is just many stressful and crying days ahead. I've never love studying because I find myself struggling so much learning new things with poor understanding. Even with the help of home tutoring, I failed common test and module back in my poly days. At one point I wanted to give up. I won't be able to get inside this poly and finish this if not for my parent's perseverance. In the end, my grades wasn't good but I still passed.Afterward my parents frequently want me to go for a degree since I can take the advanced RMIT. Back in those days I've taken toll in my health. I had panic attack and forced myself to sleep during my younger days. My heart beat so fast that I didn't know what is wrong with me. I suffered from my 2nd panic attack back in my ITE days, total blackout in my eyes. I remember not having any breakfast every morning and crying secretly behind that smiling face just to hide my unhappiness. I often came back to school sitting at the corner of my room, just sat there thinking how to break the chain of studying and studying. Is life really about certificate? And without degree the job interviewer always feel like you've not completed your study pathway. Not everyone can do a degree some people just don't have the ability to, some are just not smart enough or even not strong enough to persevere their education after failing module after module. This time round my mother encouraged me to go for a try to get a degree while my dad knows how much I suffered and is satisfied that I have a diploma at least. I know how all these torment are going to come back to me again. Thankfully I did not suffered all these symptom/phobia when it comes to work. I've also not touch any books after my last graduation for many years. What should I do?  Do you have a degree?

Things escalated when I was in secondary 3 and I often fought with him, to the point that he would call the police on me and settle the dispute. My dad and I have never ever spoken to each other, and he passed away when I was 18 during my poly common test period. I felt really empty with no emotions when he passed away, and it feels like I am a heartless person, even till this day. So I was in a relationship with this girl for 3 years who I met from my poly days. We started dating during my last year in poly. But things started to get rocky during the last 6 months of our relationship. I could start to feel the distance between me and her getting wider and I really tried to salvage the relationship but to no avail. It came to a point one day when we finally sat down and talk and she told me that a guy who she met in SIT had treated her really well in school and she feels tired of me. Obviously when I heard that I flared out at her (my mistake) and things ended really badly from there.Sometimes I would feel that my life has been really shitty and could never erase it. I try to live to the fullest every day but I would still feel this void in me. Not sure what advice I would need at this stage of my life but any advice from anyone would help me right now.-#97021: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97021",19,0,0,8,0,9,0,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

I ask why he like to see that kind of thing but he say everyone has their own preference about such things, just because he likes to see it does not mean he wish to harm people. I feel it is true as he is a very gentle and kind person from many years i have known him, and he cares very much for me and people around him. He has never hurt me not even verbally and always respects me and put me before himself.I feel he is a perfect partner just only this makes me think.

#97002,17/3/2021,"During my freshman year, I attended an orientation camp and met my facilitator, a girl, who was one year my senior. I eventually fell in love with her after the camp and asked her out individually as ""friends"". However, I'm not sure if I was being ""friendzoned"" or gaslighted for almost 3 years. 1-2 times a week, we would go out, watch movies, and have dinners with just the two of us. So we went out at least once every week to just go out and talk and play. But we didn't have any skinship at all and were moving really slowly. Texts were not often, although I texted her good morning every day. We just kept going out and things didn't really progress officially beyond friends- no hand holding, kissing etc. As I'm quite shy, I asked her if she minded getting the couple seat at Cathay. She said she's ok with it, so I got it, thinking that may be a chance to hold her hand or something. However, when I try to sit close to her in the cinema, she kept moving away. I respected her boundaries and just sat apart as well. I would send her back after every ""date"" although she lives in the West and I live in the East. It takes 2 hours to commute back via MRT/Bus. So we just kept going out for meals/movies/outings at least once every week for almost 1 year? I was perplexed so I texted her a long message asking if we were ""dating"", and she said that she treated me as a friend! Like wtf who goes out one-on-one like that and text ""good morning"" everyday to a friend? Despite that, I continued on for another year as a ""friend"" who keeps going out with her alone at least 1 time per week. I even took a Korean class (which killed my GPA btw) with her to meet her more often than 1 to 2 times a week. This is because she said that she is too busy with her CCA (she's in dance) and can't meet so often. Then I realised every Valentines' Day, she will get at least 1-2 ""confessions"" from other guys. One of them happened in the very same Korean class that I was in with her, and in the confession that guy said that she spoke to him often every night to confide in him? She denied it and said that I was being very toxic when I asked if she really did speak to this guy often at night. She said she simply treated that guy as a ""friend""?!So I took a break from her and started dating other people. After that, when she started working as an auditor, she said she's very busy and can't spare more than one night per week with me. I said ok. So around 1-2 times per week, I would go all the way to her condo in the West to play basketball/table tennis with her, or would go cycling. Then take the 2 hour train ride all the way home. After almost a year of doing this, I asked her if we were ""dating"" again, and she said we weren't, and that she was treating me as a ""friend""? I'm so confused. Is she leading me on on purpose? Did she ever like me? Which girl has so much free time to waste my time like this? It's almost 3 years of going out 1-2 times weekly alone, with no skinship.-#97002: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/97002",203,80,0,0,71,59,0,17,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

#96992,17/3/2021,"It's funny how someone so close could suddenly become a stranger. I guess this is the last letter to you which I will never send. Thanks for being my favourite person and best friend while we were still together. I still miss seeing your name pop up on my handphone screen, sending you milk & mocha bear instagram posts that reminds me of us, holding your hand and you being the first person I think of when I come across anything fun and exciting that we could do together.I don't know when cracks started to appear in our relationship. It might have been my own insecurity, the fear of losing you (irrational I know) that caused me to push you away. When you told me that marriage was just a formality, I felt my heart break because for me, marriage meant a lifetime commitment of weathering the highs and lows while still keeping our vows of ""till death do us part"". We once talked about couples and their ""honeymoon period"" and you said that you didn't believe in that because doing nice things for each other should be consistent in a relationship. But along the way, I started to fade into the background for you as you became more cold and critical towards me. Your friends became people whom you prioritised over me and whose opinions mattered more than mine.I knew that it was towards the end of our relationship on our anniversary celebration when you didn't sound too thrilled when I asked you how you felt about our 1 year relationship. When I asked you what you were looking for in a partner, you didn't want somebody who would build their life around you as you felt that it was too heavy for you to carry that burden. She would have to carry her weight financially in terms of equal contribution and you didn't want someone who was just a ""flower vase"" - looks pretty with no substance and she would have to have own passion and ambition. You were also looking for someone who could integrate well into your circle of friends. It took me by surprise because I never knew that you had such a checklist and that added additional pressure to what I was ""expected"" to be (being an introvert, not very career-minded & earning less than half of your salary) loved and accepted by you. I was hurt when you said that you didn't know that celebrating our anniversary was that special that it required a gift after I passed you mine. That night, my heart shattered from all the doubts, uncertainty and anxiety that accumulated from all our disagreements,  differences and feelings of being unappreciated & unloved. I felt that I wasn't ""good enough"" for you and knew that I needed a way out to love myself more. Even after all that has happened, I'm grateful that I had you in my life for that short period of time. It taught me more about myself, helped me to see my blindspots, and to grow. I've learnt that some fights are not worth affecting your relationship for and sometimes being kind is more important than being right. Although we are in different seasons of our lives and no longer in contact, I hope that you will be able to find your better half whom you will love and cherish and in return, do the same for you, always and forever. I will also try my best to get over and forget you even though it still hurts.-#96992: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96992",4,2,0,16,0,26,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

I don’t know if I’m lying to myself and should I give up? I think it’s really a pity if he cannot commit solely cause of his priority at this moment.

But this isn’t out of tradition, rather because my family isn’t well off and when I start working they would still be paying for my siblings. So I hope to relieve some of their burden.

My boyfriend was kinda sweet to me in the beginning when we were dating. He would usually shower me with gifts and take me out to eat good and delicious food, which I really enjoy.But anyway, after we got together officially in the 2nd semester, we started to stay over at each other's hostel room (thankfully we were both staying in single rooms at that time). I would say that things started to be more intense afterwards. He would start to introduce me to some adult films and we would watch it together, especially during Friday nights since we don't have school on Saturday. He would ask me to try out certain sexual positions while watching those films. I'm definitely new to it but I do love these intense actions and what he's doing to me. Furthermore, it's usually on Friday nights so not many people are in the hostel so we can be slightly noisy a bit.However, recently, I'm kind of feeling very drained as we are spending nearly 4 to 5 hours every week having ""netflix and chill"" sessions and I can't study during this period of time.

This kills my mood as well and I ended up not wanting it either. ???? It wasn’t like this in the initial phase of our relationship, he will always be the one to initiate it and the way he initiates it makes me feel wanted and ‘attractive’.

#96959,17/3/2021,"Admin please don't block this. I am probably going to get roasted but I hope people can still have a healthy discussion around the topic. I probably have a wrong understanding of the whole issue so I appreciate any help in helping me fixing my views.I have too main issues. 1) I am starting to find it really difficult and tiring to be in a relationship with a feminist. 2) After being with a feminist, I am confused and really wondering what exactly is feminism anyway.Don't get me wrong. I am all for woman empowerment. I am not perfect by any means. I was a chauvinist before going into this relationship and maybe I still am now, I don't know honestly. This might be a long post.I used to be a typical chauvinist. I did have certain ideas on how woman should behave, dress and interact with people. I always thought that I would only marry a beautiful and hot girl. Then, I met my current girlfriend. She was really funny and always full of energy. She was not pretty by normal standards but I did enjoy being with her so I thought I would give it a shot. She told me that my so-called ""selling"" point was that I was kind and caring. I loved to do volunteer work and help people, especially elderly, to make other's live better. I knew that she was a feminist. I told her clearly that I might have some chauvinistic views due to my upbringing and environment but I am willing to change my views. I did not want to make her feel as though she is treated unfairly or in any manner that would hurt her feelings. She agreed to take the leap of faith together and we started dating. It was going well when the cracks slowly started appearing.The problem started with clothes. I had no issues with her clothes until one day, she wore a really short fbt which was showing a little too much. I told her that it is too short and that it is showing inappropriately but she said that it is her right to wear what she wants. Ok, I apologized and backed off. Next, we were having dinner outside when I could see her bra strap showing. In my family, my parents would ask my sister to adjust their clothes if their bra straps showed and it is deemed as embarrassing. I told my gf that her strap was showing and she gave a lengthy explanation. Ok, I backed off again. So basically, I have no say in her clothes which is fine. We had gone on a overseas trip together before covid. There was this street to our hotel that had a lot of shady looking men. We walked through the street with no issues when my gf was wearing normal jeans and t-shirt. It was creepy but we did not feel any danger. Then, one night, my gf wore this skimpy outfit and we had to walk through the street. Everyone was staring at her, like literally staring without flinching. It was super scary. At that point of time, the safety of my gf was the most important thing to me. I instinctively took my sweater and covered her while quickly rushing off. Yes, I would have thrown my life to protect my gf but I might have only taken 1 or 2 guys down with me. There were at least 10 of them and they might even have had weapons. Back in the hotel, my gf scolded me like crazy for covering her. I was only prioritizing her safety. It seemed so unfair to me. At my brother's wedding, she decided to wear something very skimpy as well. Everyone was looking at her. A lot of them were looking at her inappropriately. It made me so uncomfortable and it was so annoying. I could not say anything because she would create a scene and I did not want to ruin my brother's wedding. I could not ask people to not look at her because again, my brother's wedding. I am fine with her wearing whatever she wants but she needs wear it at the appropriate place right? Am I wrong here to feel annoyed? I should wear boxers or just my underwear to her sister's wedding when it takes place.So if she decides to run around nude, I am just suppose to watch that happen without saying anything?Next issue. I can't help it ok. I like to look at pretty girls. Unfortunately, if a pretty girl walks past me, I tend to look at them. It is not something I do consciously. This ""chauvinistic"" and ""superficial"" action of looking at beautiful girls gets me into trouble with my gf all the time. I really put in effort to ignore but when I am really tired and in auto mode, my eyes just move on their own. I mean all the guys look at beautiful girls right? Sometimes I wish I can just pluck out my eyes so that I don't have to deal with this issue.Next issue, her constant nitpicking. I already told her that I had chauvinistic views but am willing to change. Every time, I say something chauvinistic, she blows it up into a huge fight where it ends up with me having to run after her or go to her house in the middle of the night or fights that lasts for days and sometimes weeks. I mean if I said something wrong, she could just correct me and explain to me.  I already said that I am willing to change. Now, I am very careful with what I say to her. I have to constantly think before I say anything, literally anything. If I offer to crack the crab shell, she might think that I think that she cannot crack the shell herself. Even if she is struggling, I can't say it because she will think that I think that she is not capable of overcoming it. I have to constantly tip toe around her and I feel like I am in a minefield. I just need to say 1, just 1 wrong word and it is just explosions all around.Then, sometimes, she would complain that I am not offering help. Then, I am like ""WHAT THE $&%?"". We had a few friends that are mutual. One time, one of the mutual friend got into an argument with her. I stepped in to help her and protect her. Then, she started exploding in my face saying that I am chauvinistic. Ok, then, I ****ing backed off. We had another similar incident again with someone else but this time I just watched while eating my char kway teoy, slurping every bite. Then, she complained that I did not back her up. What the *&#! am I supposed to do? After seeing her contradictory actions, I am really starting to wonder what is feminism anyway? Isn't feminism just being treated equally?I asked her since she wants to be treated equally, would she do national service? She just said that it is the men's duty to protect the nation. Then, I am like huh? She preached so much on equality.It is as if she just takes whatever that benefits her from equality and disregards anything disadvantageous that comes from equality. Is this feminism? Is the male partner of a feminist suppose to feel so cornered? Is this the future?I have worked on this relationship for 3 years. It is stressful to be around her and I feel quite lifeless. I am still holding on to the relationship because of the sheer amount of effort I have put into keep it together. I don't know if this will pay off or if am I just being a stupid idiot holding on to this.-#96959: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96959",86,14,0,18,12,34,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
#96947,17/3/2021,"Please don’t filter. Need some advice here...I (26M) met this girl (23F) from dating app in September last year and we hit it off pretty well. She’s smart, lovely and hardworking and that really caught my attention. We texted each other like long lost friends and never run out of conversations. We texted each daily and only in December that we decided to officially meetup. After the first meetup, we made plans to met up every other weekend to spend time together. We would take turns to plan for the weekend meet and over a short span of time, we travelled to almost all places where a couple can visit in Singapore. One night after our dinner in January, she officially asked me to be together. I felt so comfortable around her and of course I immediately agreed to it. To be honest, I’ve never loved someone so much in my life before and I was so happy to have found her. I enjoyed every second with her and I see her as a life partner. Then on, I started having tons of plans for our future and want to eventually marry her and start a family together.She always wears a gold necklace given to her by her mum and she always tells me how much it meant to her. This is her first relationship and wanting it to be special and memorable for her, I bought her a pair of gold earrings to remember our first Valentines together. Hoping that the earrings will be something meaningful to her, I intend to give it to her and put it on for her at the end of the day. We went for our dinner and walked around the mall. I was acting the whole time after dinner as if like I was looking for a gift for her. In fact, I already got her something. We walked pass a goldsmith and I just looked at the gold pieces on display. She held onto my hand and told me not to buy anything expensive for her or she’ll be angry and she pulled me away from the shop. Not wanting her to be angry, I kept the earrings in my car and only gave her a bouquet of tulips that I got beforehand. Till today the earrings are still with me.After being together for a few weeks, her text came in short streams and replies came in after hours. Back then I thought she’s just busy with work and doesn’t have time to reply and I didn’t think too much. Our weekly planned “dates” started becoming just a normal lunch and head back home kind of routine. She started being cold towards me and I wonder what I did wrongly to upset her... I wanted to find a chance to talk to her and fix things but never had the chance to do so. Just days back on our weekly meetup, she told me she want things to end. She told me she just don’t feel it with me, she don’t see a future with me and she’s sorry... That really broke me... From a life ahead of us, everything just crash and ended there... I started having sleep issues and a great loss in appetite. Whenever I close my eyes all I can think is her. Whenever I get some proper rest, I’ll dream of her and wake up crying... Sometimes tears just roll uncontrollably when I’m at work... I always look at my phone, hoping to see a text from her. This if affecting me badly and I just can’t forget her... I really love her and I don’t want to lose her. What should I do... Please give me some advice...-#96947: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96947",73,23,0,39,0,58,0,48,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#96945,17/3/2021,"Is it ever acceptable for a married person to insist on a divorce even though his/her spouse has done nothing wrong?My mom has recently suggested that she wants a divorce with my dad even though my dad is possibly the most responsible and faithful father and husband in the world. Since they've been married 25 years ago, my father has surrendered all income to my mom and received a small allowance every month. He is a freelance consultant and he earns close to $1500 every DAY, but my mom only gives him $3000 a month. Any more and he would have to ask for it. My mom deals with all the finances at home. The condo is paid off, a gift from my grandfather on my dad's side. My dad does all the cleaning at home, he washes up after every meal (even though my mom always cooks), he does the laundry, and he does all the repairs and maintenance. My mom calls herself a ""housewife"" but honestly, my dad has been more of a ""housewife"" for the 25 years I have been alive. My dad doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, he works his ass off for the family, and he also buys her presents/dinner EVERY SINGLE year on her birthday, on their marriage anniversary, and on the anniversary of the first time they met. He spares no expense, DESPITE the fact that he only has $3000 a month to spend. My mom, on the other hand, never remembers. She even had the audacity to say to me, after I asked her why she never once bought anything or even wrote a nice letter to my dad on his birthday, that ""[she] cooks for him every day."" I am speechless.But let's just set that all aside and let's discuss the institution of marriage for a moment.When we marry someone, we promise to be with them for the rest of our lives. It's a commitment, it's a contract. If anyone ever doubts that they will be able to make the commitment of time, then they should never have agreed to enter into that contract in the first place.My mom is suggesting a divorce because she feels, and I quote, she doesn't love my dad anymore. The whole framework of my dad was destroyed, and he still continues to work. I have not spoken to her for 6 months after I heard her say that to my face, and I will probably not speak to her for the rest of my life. Please respect the institution of marriage. When you're married to someone, unless he/she is unfaithful, or does anything illegal, please, don't mess around.-#96945: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96945",123,71,0,25,0,207,0,102,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

#96934,17/3/2021,"I’ve recently been diagnosed with a chronic disorder. According to the doctor, although its not deadly, it is currently still incurable. But I’ll still be able to lead a typical lifestyle except during relapses, which is unfortunately, unpredictable as there are no known triggers. The problem is, the doctor said that such disorders may be due to genetics, which means that if I have children in future, they might get the disorder. My boyfriend and I originally intend to have children in future. But because of this, I have expressed that I have changed my mind about having children for fear of passing down this illness to them. I’ll feel very guilty if our children’s lives are affected due to our decision (the pains of the relapses, having to live on medication etc). However, my boyfriend’s stance is that we should still give it a try since there is no guarantee that the illness will be passed down.  I really don’t think it’s right to take the risk knowing the possibility of passing down the illness, but he seems unconvinced.He is also not open to the idea of adoption as he wants his very own child, and that his parents are quite traditional and are likely not to agree too.I don’t want to go down the route of breakup as we really love each other alot.

#96930,17/3/2021,"So this happened today:I have ordered my food and looking for a seat while the food was prepared at one of the food courts in Jurong East. It was during the peak dinner time and the seats in the food court was mostly full, making it difficult to find a seat. After searching for some time, I saw this young couple in their early 30s who was eating with 2 empty seats beside them (it was a corner table) and I asked politely if I can sit beside them. To my surprise, I was promptly rejected and their reason was that they were not able to sit beside us as the rule was each group need to be separated by 1m. That made me really angry as firstly, I thought that it was only 8 people that needed to be separated by a meter, regardless of them being strangers or not (which I was wrong after I went to government website to check, they were in fact in the right to reject me) and also by the fact that this young couple was one of the only couple that rejected me in my days of eating in a crowded food court (post covid). I never had these kind of problems in town area during lunch hours and was not sure if it was a common theme among younger generations to be so anal, for a lack of better word, about these kind of things.For me, I've never rejected anyone who wishes to share a table for the simple reason that I value efficiency (I'm by no means a good person/saint). Perhaps we need to be strictly following what the government says about social distancing and the right thing is to suggest to the fellow diner to consume their food in the toilet cubical, especially so if you are rushing for time since I value my piracy too much to share this table with you. (or maybe the dude is really concerned about covid spreading). Eventually I managed to find another couple in their 50s who were VERY willing to share their adjacent seats with me. But guess what? After I've consumed my food, the previous couple actually found a safe distancing ambassador to speak to the manager of that food court who went to on inform me that our young Singaporean couple was indeed right to reject my request and she told me that I shouldn't forcefully sit with them which I didn't (though I did indicate my intention to sit with them to consume my meal). Note that this couple actually went around the food court to look for me as they had no idea where I went to sit at as I was at the other part of the food court (or maybe I might have already finished my meal, but these guys were determined!)There are some bits and pieces which I left out and I'm not fully proud of my actions as I sort of lost my cool when confronting the young couple initially, I admit that they are on the right side of the law and I was wrong to call them out when they are doing the right thing, but I'm just amazed at the lack of empathy shown to a fellow Singaporean. Maybe I'm completely out of line here and this couple should be the epitome of a good Singaporean, or maybe I'm representing the majority, who would volunteer their adjacent seats to others in need.

And now because of travel restrictions and quarantine, it's over a year and a half since I've gone back to visit my family, especially my grandparents, who cry to me every call, missing me because they're both increasingly ill and they don't think they have much time left. It breaks my heart every time, yet I'm powerless because I'm barred from returning home from all the restrictions. I miss the mountainous terrains of the countryside, the starry night skies and the fragrance of food that I loved.Academics and work are suffocating enough, the lack of prospect of when I can go home just put me in deeper despair. I can feel myself slipping and losing at every turn.

I'll be honest, I chose this course because it seemed attractive with good future pay, but now I think I'm just messing myself up.

#96907,17/3/2021,"Prof Ben, seek your opinion on work related stuff. I’m a fresh grad and had just started work for a year. In the beginning, I was happy and mix well with everybody. In work,I have a group of friends that I always will hang out with, not super close, but consider a family at work. Each of us will help each other and we work closely as a team. When I was new and not sure about the workflow etc, they will help me and I accepted their help.Slowly, I learnt more, and I have my own judgment on things and I do not need their help so much like before. But this group of friends think that I’m still a baby and always ‘help’ me on things that I should be making decisions by myself. There are so many episodes but I tahan and didn’t express because I think they are out of good will to help me.One day, this colleague she did the same thing again. I was working and I had an answer in my mind already, she jumped in and gave a different instruction to my clients that is totally not what I wanted to do. I stopped her in front of the clients, before she could further explain what she wants to do to them. I didn’t accept her help this time because I think this’s serious and if the client has any accident happen I will be the one people will place blame because the decision is made under my account. So I stopped her right in front of the client’s face. She angry. She angry coz i didn’t respect her, and cut her off in front of clients. I am angry too. So we fought. I was angry because she has been making judgment call all day long and without discussing w me, she directly told my clients what she wants to do, and all that decisions are documented under my name. I will be the one who will attend court if harm is made, not her. Professionally I’m right, my decision is in the best interest of my clients.I confronted her but she think she not wrong, she thinks it’s my fault because I refused to accept her help and I disgraced her in front of clients.I brought this up to my superior. But she is very good at talking. She told boss that the client may make complaint to our institution head because of the way I talk to her as client might think we dunno know our work well hence we have different opinions. And I kena scolded by boss for this. I explained my point of view to my boss that she doesn’t know the client well n yet making call without consulting me first. But I don’t know whether she got scolded by boss or not. Ever since then we seldom talk. We used to talk about life/bf/jokes but now we only talk about work related things, like we are not friend anymore. I’m worried that if I start to be friendly to her she will turn around and talk behind my back, which she always does. My concern is, I might lose my social circle if I’m not friend w her.  At work, we somehow will need to socialise and i feel sad of losing a ‘friend’ at work. Although she is not my good good friend but I stand a chance to lose my gang at work. I dun care about her because professionally I’m right, I care about my social circles. But I dunwan to be so fake like her. Idk I somehow turning to be the Adult I used to hate. I know I’ll keep changing to fit this world, and I dunwan  to lose ‘me’.  So prof Ben, how do I draw the line to distance them from changing me and at the same time keeping my social circle?

#96901,17/3/2021,"*apologise for any error or typo, and mentioning of race to try explain the story, and it might be complicated*I was at Bishan Junction 8 pet lover's today, 15/04/2021 at 7:28pm. My friend and I went into the store to get some hamster treats. When i first went into the the store, there was already a chinese lady who was with her son talking to 2 of the staff working there. There was also another indian lady at the payment counter. My friend and i didnt think much, we were just looking at the pets and then we started hearing this lady shouting. The chinese lady turned out to be a freaking KAREN LOL.KAREN kept shouting at the staff and shouted things like-""I'm very disappointed in you""""You will have to pay for it, you're responsible""""I will complain about you""""We are very sincere YOU KNOW"""" I CALLED YOU AT 12PM TO TELL YOU WE WILL BE COMING DOWN TONIGHT""""THEY HAVE PIANO LESSONS YOU KNOW""( referring to her son and her daughter who was with her husband which both of them were not there at that point of time )"" DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO COME HERE FROM EAST COAST???1111?1!11?1?1?1?11!!"""" DONT SAY SORRY TO ME SAY SORRY TO HIM"""" THEY CAME HERE WITHOUT EATING DINNER YOU KNOW?!?!??????!?""THIS karen was shouting and saying that she came in yesterday but because the store was closing, they couldnt make up their mind if they want this freaking rabbit, so they said they will come back today. I didn't get the any of the staff's name but the staff who talked to this KAREN on the phone told her the Pet lover's policy is that they are not allowed to reserve pets just by using words over the phone( they said the call was made at about 12pm ). common sense ?? no ?? no guarantee no nothing, just words? The indian lady also called up the store to give them a heads up, the staff also said that she also told the indian lady the samepolicy and there is also another customer who is interested in getting the rabbit.The Indian lady was there first and already bought the necessities for her new pet rabbit, like cage and whatever not. When she paid for everything, Karen went into the stall and found out that the rabbit was already sold. KAREN was obviously unhappy and started shouting those things above. She also raised her voiced at the staff asking"" WHO IS IT ?!? WHO YOU SELL IT TO ?!? ""and the staff pointed to the indian lady beside her son LOL this KAREN dare not shout at the Indian lady so she took it out on the poor staff ????The staff again, tried explain to KAREN why the rabbit was sold, and kept apologising. KAREN BEING KAREN obviously shouted even louder and louder infront of her son. So Karen called her husband down LOLOL typical Karen move. JUST SAYING, the husband did nothing at all and he kept quiet the whole entire time. So the more Karen couldnt get the cute rabbit, she kept asking her husband to do something about it.So KAREN and family was blocking the entrance, the staff who was being shouted at started tearing up but quickly wiped away her tears and went out behind them to welcome other customers in. Karen wasnt done so she stepped back and continue barking at the staff. The second staff went to call the supervisor and tried explaining the situation but also broke down. The supervisor told the staff to call security and then security came down. When 2 of the security came down, they asked the safe entry staff ( because he was the one who called them ) what happened and he just pointed to all of us. I pointed at KAREN. When Karen saw the 2 security officer, she asked them 'What's the problem?? can you solve this for us? no? I'm dealing this with her!1!1?!?!?1!1!"" and the staff didnt want to trouble them so she told them it's ok. So  basically the security guards just stood beside Karen's family and did nothing but kept quiet the entire time LOL thanksThe staff apologised again and said that she understand that she's very angry and it's her fault.  but KAREN pointed to her children and told the staff - ""DONT SAY SORRY TO ME!1!1!1!11!!11!!!!!!! SAY SORRY TO THEM""The staff didnt hesitate a single bit and step forward and apologised to KAREN DNA kids. LMAO the entire time when KAREN was inside the store with her son, he was just staring into blank space. Suddenly he 'cried' when the staff apologised and went behind KAREN. At this point, I told my friend about it and he stepped forward. He told KAREN to not raise her voice and to not shout anymore because there were many passerby who stopped and stare. It must have been really embarrassing for the staff what??? Karen not happy so she told my friend -""Keep quiet, I'm having a conversation with her""My friend fired back saying, "" No you're not, you're shouting at her and she dont have to deal with your attitude"" KAREN'S PRIDE MUST HAVE BEEN HURT at this point, and she asked my friend "" WHAT ATTITUDE?!1?1?1! ""My friend then told the staff-""just go in, you dont have to deal with her attitude""He then looked at Karen and told her"" if you're unhappy, you can just call the police.""Then at Karen's husband"" Please control your wife ""KAREN'S HUSBAND kept tapping her arm said let's go. NO USE LORRRR. AND SHE OBV DIDNT CALL the police la cause she knew she was out of line I pulled the staff back into the store and she kept telling me she was okay and it was her fault. Then i told KAREN she was abusing the staff, she's so crazy in the head she can ask me how is she doing that. HER daughter who is about like p3/4, said to me "" but we already called about the rabbit "" lmao and i answered, didnt the staff already tellyou about their policy ???I told her she have been shouting and raising her voice for 30minutes. "" ARE YOU SURE 30MINS ?!??!?!?! """" urm yes ???? ""and then she kept quiet LOL and then she ask me to SHUT UPso i was already very frustrated at how self entitled she is, i shouted back at her.i told her to stfu and shes a f*cking b*tch, i know it was unnecessary but she really went out of line by shouting at the staff NON STOP. demoralising the staff by saying she's irresponsible and unreasonable. telling the staff she will pay for itblah blah nonsense ????? this my first every time witnessing a karen. SHOUTING and fighting over a freaking rabbit. Then her daughter suddenly went from like omg we called about the rabbit to ma im sorry we dont want the rabbit anymore. One of the secuirty uncle looked at me and signaled me to keep quiet and not say anything. LOL OK THANK YOU COMING DOWN you can go back up and secure this mall. please restrict all karens next time thank you ????SO karen gave up after she was being fired back atand started walking away and mubling to herself. HOW is she not embarrassed for acting so rowdy and disgusting in public over a freaking rabbit???? Even when the staff cried infront of her, she have no freaking remorse or whatsoever LOLI hope pet lover's do not believe the shit this KAREN says LMAO-#96901: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96901",153,167,0,0,111,299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I love her very much, although she has a lot of body problems and seems to be unwell and unhealthy all the time. She doesn't have any serious sickness, but near every other day, she's not feeling well / got headache / feet pain cannot walk / chest pain / eyes tired and pain / stomach upset, etc, just generally there's always something wrong with her. I've tried to accommodate her as much as I can and have spent a lot of time and money fetching her to clinic and buying her vitamins and supplement hoping it will help.At this point it may seem I am complaining about her body problems but I'm actually not. I don't mind to care for her. What hurt me is the way she treated me when I myself am unwell. Compared to her, I am relatively healthy, I rarely got sick and am in good health majority of the time. But recently I got appendicitis, and even after operation the surgery area hurt a lot for almost 2 weeks. And she became very sarcastic and cold, telling me to ""not make pathetic looking face"" and ""please don't talk in that weak voice"". Once I twisted my ankle while playing badminton, and while going home she told me not to lean on her because it's very shameful for her.Similar things happened a few times before, she becomes very cold and tells me not to ""act weak and pathetic"" when I am injured or not feeling well. I actually brought it up to her recently and said it hurts a lot when you do that, as I try my best to care for you. And she got really mad and said I don't understand that girls want a strong man. She said things like ""no girl wants a guy that act weak"" and when I said sometimes it's really painful especially my surgery, she got even angrier and said ""do you think it is worse than period?"". I said I'm not asking you to care for me, just to understand it hurts, and she kept saying all girls hate guys who act pathetic and guys don't understand that girls get pain every month and we don't have the right to act weak.Do a lot of girls think this way? I don't have a lot of female friends. It's hurtful as, I mean her periods are not my fault, I've tried to be as helpful and accommodating as I can when she has them, which I feel is the least a guy can do.

#96863,17/3/2021,"Just a rant that many people might not like (maybe admin doesn't like it and won't bother posting as well).I think majority of Singaporeans are getting less and less competitive. Becoming more and more like the US, anything goes wrong just blame others, never their own fault. Blame others for taking away their jobs, yet never reflect and see if they themselves are providing more value to the company. If you can't compete on price because of difference in cost of living, then compete in terms of value. I've seen Singaporeans around me who grew up in low-average income families, and yet they can achieve high positions and comfortable salaries. Why aren't they losing their jobs then?Any positive data they the government provides, such as improvement in economy or drop in unemployment, it is always bullshit to them because they are not part of the % who have improved. To them, if they are suffering, means others must also be suffering. I don't even come from NUS, I'm from a mediocre university with mediocre results and no CCA or accomplishments to speak of, yet it is still not impossible for a fresh grad like me to find a job. Though the salary is not as high as some of the salaries I've seen on this page, it is still a job I want nevertheless. I even have friends who went for courses under skillsfuture and found jobs from there, without having a university degree. And yet there are people claiming that this is useless?If you can't help yourself, no one can help you. These are the kind of people they will claim that I'm being a government mouthpiece, because they don't have any valid counter-arguments.

Which job should I choose?Company A: $5k/ mth. No bonus so meaning I’ll earn 60k per year fixed regardless of my performance. 1.5 hr travel time from my house as location is a bit far. Highly related to my course of study. Relatively stable job and environment is friendly/ not very toxic. Progression is slower as staff tends to stay very long in their posts and lateral movement is also difficult. Job scope is pretty fixed and likely I’ll be doing similar stuff 5, 10 years later or even longer.Company B: 4.2k/ mth. Total Bonus ranges from 1.5-4.5 months depending on performance. 50 min travel time. Not so related to my course. Environment is more competitive and demanding but will have higher chance of progression and bigger pay rise if you perform well. Company likes to rotate its employees so I can’t expect to stay fixed to a role even if I love it. Has a history of retrenchments during bad times and also asking poorer performers to leave.

#96855,17/3/2021,"The pleasures and sorrows of hospital pharmacyTo establish my background, let’s just say I have served at an understaffed hospital outpatient pharmacy for what feels like an indeterminate infinity.The pleasures: first and foremost, the chance to observe life and be philosophical about it…My job provides me a unique position to interact with numerous people daily, the majority of whom have suffered from various diseases, some of which appear quite invisible to society, yet very obvious to me.The rich and the poor suffer illnesses alike, but as inequality strikes, the poor suffer more, for they often cannot afford their medications. Many are under government assistance. I can glimpse a glimmer of embarrassment in their eyes when they collect their free medications. For these deserving poor people, I try to make the process of not paying for medicine as blasé as possible, without embarrassing them. In other words, I have the pleasure to deal out hope and kindness in people’s bleakest of times.The ones that get my goats are the filthy rich who stay at good class bungalows and try to cut the registration line. Their stories are implausible, excuses laughable, often clinging to their status, wealth or connections to some VIPs. I am so and so and I know so and so. Likewise, some of the extreme poor, with little to lose, will throw outright tantrums at the pharmacy in order to have their ways. Under these circumstances, I can’t help, but strangely and un-regrettably indulge in the guilty pleasure of judging these people immensely.One after another, grown men and women rise to their feet, walking or hobbling to my counter to pick up the medications to alleviate their pain in one way or another. I observe first-hand how people suffer at different stages in life. For the female sex, their problems can be Flagystatin for a yeast infection, then Misoprostol for an unwanted pregnancy and at the later life stage, Vagifem for post-menopausal dryness. As for the male species, they may need minoxidil initially then sildenafil and may even progress to PGE injectionsFor the other poor unfortunate souls of both sexes, they may suffer from some obscure congenital diseases that destroy their kidneys and start them on the path of dialysis and transplantation and a lifetime of hospital visits. Perched from this vantage point, even my over-exhausted brains can’t help but feel saddened for those who suffer relentlessly, for the patients, for the carers… Somehow, even wedged in the middle of the maddening crowd, we nevertheless retain some compassionate reflexes, a remnant of empathy for a suffering human fellow.The patients, their bodies and minds, ravaged by diseases, often lead them to voice endless hostilities against hospital staff. Some of these people go to the hospitals daily, their eyes sometimes filled with hope but more often, despair.I go to hospital daily too. But unlike them, I am paid to be here. So, I try not to take any of the verbal abuse personally, even though they like to threaten to write my names in the feedback form, which may reach my management and may or may not affect my KPI. But frankly, I am beyond caring about pleasing the upper management who live in their ivory towers and care little for the “real” frontline staff.What about the sorrows?Towards the end of every workday, I am physically and mentally exhausted, from talking 8-10 hours non-stop to people, explaining not-always-logical healthcare policies to them, telling off the ones who try to cut queues, calling doctors to discuss the therapies, etc . All these are done under the disapproving eyes of impatient people staring daggers.  Some of them circulate like flies unhelpfully near the dispensing counters, demanding their medications to be given out immediately without regards to the other fellow patient beings.Little did they know, our upper hospital management subject us to the same waiting time criticism, yet neglect to point out that we are perpetually short of staff because the management cannot afford to employ more people because millions of dollars have been spent on an expensive IT system that has needed 34 updates since its implementation three years ago. I wonder whether the IT system might not be part of the very problem that it had been designed to address, whether its production was not indeed contributing to precisely the feelings of frustration and nervous tension which it claims to alleviate.I wonder out loud to my colleagues why in our society the greatest sums of money so often tended to accrue from the sale of the least meaning things, and why the dramatic improvements in efficiency and productivity at the heart of any Quality Improvement Projects so seldom extend beyond lip service.Staff are exhorted to complete the department feedback surveys multiple times. Improving staff morale rarely extend beyond endless early morning meetings and brainless engagements that in fact exhaust staff more.Never far from doubting the wisdom of my own career choice, I was quite pleasantly surprised when a friend at a gym commented “Meaningful!” when told that I work as a pharmacist at a hospital.When does a job feel meaningful, really? Whenever it allows us to generate delight or reduce suffering in othersTo be honest, I am jaded but, stoically I carry on because deep down, very few people can claim their jobs have a hand in reducing suffering, yet unlike doctors I would never have to do a digital rectal examination in my entire professional life. Suffice it to say, this works out well so far because I ,incidentally am also a germaphobia. What can I say to my junior? An understandable hunger for fees from potential students tempts the school to overpromise, like the out of practice prof who out of greed or sentimentality, sometimes imply that all of their pharmacy students could one day produce worthwhile career, rather than frankly acknowledging the troubling truth, that to achieve great positions is an anomalous event. Indeed, virtually everything the student believes to be true, because their teacher has told them so, turns out to be the exact opposite. Beware, for experience might just be the cloak worn by charlatans and humbugs.For the rest of history, for the most of us, our bright promise will always fall short; it will hardly earn us bountiful sums of money or beget us extraordinary fame. Resilience, Diligence and Intelligence are needed to redraw the map of our reality, which we ourselves must find the path.#nuspharmacy-#96855: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96855",16,31,0,22,0,163,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#96849,17/3/2021,"Hi guys! Can I ask you for your advice on how to deal with terrible neighbours? There is an 50 yr+ Indian uncle downstairs who has tried to blackmail us 2 times. We called the police but only reports have been made. We still have to deal with the guy. Background of this terrible neighbour:- He blasts 70s music loud until 1st floor (he lives on 10th) many times. Neighbours complain about him and it is in the police report.- He is alcoholic and often showed up in the lift with alcohol smells. - He has thrown things down from the windows (left-over food, rubbish etc.) One time it was a monitor. Thankfully there was a balcony at 8th floor. No one gets hurt so far. Neighbours complain about him and it is in the police report.- He often makes stories up and complains about other people. He reported a few to police. None of those stories were true. - He blackmailed my parents last year. He said the clothes they hanged were too wet that the water dripped to his phone and spoiled it. He asked for S$50. I wasn't at home. My poor parents were confused and gave in so that he won't continue to give trouble.Today he banged on the door again and said I made noise on the floor and he couldn't sleep. But I was napping in bed. So I politely asked him to leave. He refused and started to shout. And he started to ask if I am alone at home (I am a female) and ask me to open the door. He also tore the decoration on my door. I called the police and put the police on speaker mode. He got scared and threatened me he would come back. Then he quickly left my door. After 10 min, 2 police officers showed up and I explained everything to them. They went to the uncle's house to look for him. No one answered the door. Again, police made reports and left. I am thankful for the quick response of the police. Yet reality hits me that this uncle is still wondering around my neighbourhood. I believe that majority of our society is nice and kind. But it always has a few individuals that put us at risk. How do I protect myself before something bad happens as a small-size female? He dare to destroy the decoration on my door in front of my face. I am not sure when I am not around what other crazy stuff he can do. He knows my face too. I am scared to move around my neighbourhood alone now.My sincere gratitude.-#96849: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96849",56,8,34,6,0,33,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is with much regret that all his effort for previous test has gone to waste because 5% of the class choose to CHEAT on a LEVEL ONE module that was proctored. Dr Lee is offering the students who cheated a chance to own up for more lenient punishment, while those who choose not to own up (but are already discovered) who be brought up to the Dean and higher management for further punishment. I strongly believe that all the students involved should face similar punishment like those of the CS (https://www.straitstimes.com/.../coronavirus-nus-students...).

I did ask her why didn't she say no or get out of that place but she said she did, but he was forceful and did whatever he wanted. All she thought was to ""let this be over with so I can get out"". After he was done she hurriedly tried to clean it off, got dressed up and left. This was around 4 years ago.I was sharing my experience too when I was pulled to an isolated staircase with a random uncle as a kid... He also did unspeakable things to me and I didn't know what was happening until I grew up and realised. I felt very humiliated and ashamed of myself. This was around a decade ago.What I wanted to ask was is it still possible for either of us to make a report? I don't really want anything to happen but I just feel like some closure would be good for her especially.

#96822,17/3/2021,"Some people are so “nice”. They are always willing to do all the nice things for you although you didn’t ask them to do all those for you. But strangely, when you’re unable to fulfil their expectations, they will say that they are disappointed in you. A nice person won’t tell everyone about the things they have done for you. A nice person do things quietly and do not expect you to return the favour. A nice person will not tell everyone what they have done for you and then complain about how you disappoint them if you’re not as nice as them. Just because someone is nice to you, it doesn’t give them the right to demand something from you. If you can’t meet their expectations, it’s not your problem. It’s their problem for having expectations. Do not let someone guilt-trip you into changing yourself to meet their expectations. Be thankful and appreciate what they have done for you and that’s good enough. If you want to do nice things for them, good for you. If you don’t want to, that’s fine too. Some people do nice things for you, not because they want you to be happy but because they want something in return. What do they want? Compliance, obedience, control, power? Or they just want to portray a good image? Or they think being nice is an obligation or responsibility? Or they do not want to look like they are selfish humans? Some people are nice to you, not because of you, but because of themselves. Yet they think the problem is YOU when you are not as nice as them. They say you are a selfish person when you say ‘no’ to them. They say you are selfish when you cannot return the favour. They say you are selfish if you do not care about them as much as they care about you. They blame you for being ungrateful. They blame you for their disappointment when in the first place, they were the ones who willingly chose to be nice. What is a nice person?A nice person gives without asking anything in return. A nice person cares for you and does not calculate how much you care for them in return. A nice person will not set expectations and get angry when you don’t meet them. A nice person will not do anything that would hurt you and would genuinely apologise if they have unintentionally hurt you. A nice person listens to you patiently instead of constantly talking about themselves all the time. A nice person respects you, your feelings and your personality. They do not claim that your feelings are not valid and they do not ask you to change your personality.A nice person does not expect you to be as nice as them. They only hope that you would treat them with basic respect. If they are upset at you due to your lack of respect, they will gently tell you about their feelings instead of blaming you for their feelings. To have a nice person as a family, friend or partner is a privilege. If you have them in your life, please cherish them and do not mistake their kindness for weakness. Please don’t ever disrespect them. Don’t blame them if they can’t meet your expectations. They are just humans who are fighting their own battles. Even if you think their battles are insignificant, it doesn’t mean they are not struggling. And it doesn’t mean they have the capacity to fulfil your expectations. Being nice is not an obligation. Being nice is a choice and it takes alot of effort to be nice to people. If someone is genuinely nice to you without expectations, please appreciate them.Thank you KY & YT for being the nicest humans I have ever known. Thank you for always being there for me, listening to me for hours when I feel down, reassuring me when other people try to make me feel inferior, doing all these nice things for me without expecting anything in return. I’m not a good listener like the both of you yet you all have never expected me to be a good listener. I’m not as nice as the both of you but you all have never expected me to be as nice. You all have done so much for me, without complaints, without judgement, without asking me to change my selfish behaviour. Just quietly being there for me, listening to my problems, supporting me in whatever I do, and doing all the nice things for me without asking me to do the same for you all. I don’t even know what I have done to deserve you all. I only know I’m the luckiest person on earth because you two are in my life.-#96822: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96822",12,24,0,9,0,62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
#96815,17/3/2021,"How do people deal with it if their partner's personality changes, sometimes not for the better? I'd share the stories of my past 2 rs and would like to ask for advice on how to handle any future rs.Girl A, 2 year+ rs. She was a cheerful, happy-go-lucky girl. About a year into our rs, a close aunt of her unexpectedly passed away from cancer. From that point on, she gradually became depressed and lose her cheerfulness. At first, I was there for her, hearing her out and hope that her wounds would heal with time. However, as time passed, it looked like it was more difficult than first thought. She became more and more pessimistic about things in general. Our dates often are sombre and she would say something pessimistic or sad about virtually any topic we talk about. She couldn't laugh anymore. Despite professional help, her condition didn't really improve much. At that time, I was also having some personal issues on top of my stressful school work and these just add on to my worries. I realized that it was affecting my mental health as well and dragging me down and decided to end the rs once and for all. Girl B, 2 year rs. What attracted me to her was her simple down to earth and thrifty nature. We met when I was in my 3rd year and she was in her 4th. A few months after we got together, she graduated and went into the working world. However, over time she became influenced by her colleagues and the work environment and became more materialistic. She would start buying branded bags, makeup and clothes which she never did before. She was not satisfied with the simple pleasures of life anymore. We used to eat at food courts and hawker centres but she started asking me to go and eat those pricier food. I talked to her twice and while she did change her behaviour, it was only temporary and she would slowly go back to her usual pattern. Her work environment was stressful and being affected by the stress, she became a lot more moody and would throw her temper at the slightest things. I saw that she was no longer the person I knew and also fearing for my finances if I settle down with her, I ended things as well.When people first got together, each person is often attracted to some qualities of the other. However, as we know people can change over time. The person may not be the same 1 year, 5 years or 20 years later. I am afraid that if I go into the next rs, I may bail out again once the person's personality changes and affects me negatively and the cycle will repeat. I hope anyone can advise me how to handle such issues in a long term rs or is bailing out the only option?-#96815: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96815",83,9,0,0,9,37,0,7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Aren't you ashamed of all the emotional wreckage you bring to everyone you claimed you love or called them your friend? How much lower are you going to stoop?All i can say to you is you have done enough emotional damage to people. Quit going back to your ex lovers with all your problems and expecting them to solve them for you by manipulating them.

Telling you directly (multiple times) about your toxic behaviours doesn't seem to stop you from doing them, shall leave it out to the society to teach you the proper ways. Making people constantly think they are worthless by taunting them that you don't want or need them anymore, telling them that you'll leave and ditch them. People aren't toys for you to pick up when you need them and throw aside when they are done helping with your issues.

You aren't a christian yourself, but heed this - Proverbs 6:32I sincerely hope that you are aware and come to realise the full impact of your own actions and the toxicity you bring about to people.

#96791,17/3/2021,"Is it hypocritical for climate change activist to have children? The average lifetime carbon footprint of a single person is around 20 metric tonnes. Since having children is always a choice, especially since abortions are legal in Singapore, you will contribute 20 metric tonnes of carbon each time you decide to bring a new life onto the earth. The whole basis of environmentalism, the biggest reason why we do it, is to preserve the habitability of the earth for future generations. Yet, in deciding to create future generations of people, we also choose to contribute substantially to global carbon emissions. It is ultimately a little bit disingenuous to say that on one hand I care about environmental degradation, but on another hand I want to make a decision that will evidently cause continual harm to the environment, long after I am dead. I think we can all be a little more ethically consistent. If we're supporting environmentalism for the sake of the earth and animals, then we should stop making humans because humans are the problem. If we want to continue to make more humans, then we should accept that environmental degradation is an unavoidable byproduct due to the Tragedy of the Commons, and any behavioral modification on the scale of 7 billion people is either going to be an insurmountable challenge, or too late to bring about any significant change in our climate trajectory.-#96791: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96791",65,8,0,0,33,60,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

#96784,17/3/2021,"A few weeks ago I found out from my close friend that my gf was on a dating app. He even showed me her profile, and according to her profile description and photos, that profile seems legit and doesn't seem like a catfish. Not saying that my gf is ugly or what, but at least I know she doesn't have the look that people might want to use to impersonate. TBH I'm quite devastated when I saw that, cos we've been together for 3 years plus, and even planned when to BTO, so I decided to confront her to find out the truth and whether she is cheating on me. During the confrontation, she told me that she was just tempted to play with dating apps since her friends around her are happily meeting guys and girls through the app, but she has no intention to meet or talk to the guys that matched her. She said she only used them for a few days just for fun, see how the guys on dating apps look like, and partly due to curiosity as well, but she has already deleted the apps. Despite her assurance and explanation, I've been bothered by this situation for a few weeks, and I'm very tempted to see who she matched with and what she talked to those guys about. Is this considered a breach of her privacy?

#96775,17/3/2021,"Hello to the poster of #96745. I once faced the science vs arts dilemma back in JC. I took a more science and maths heavy combination in secondary school but was always much more inclined to studying the humanities and social sciences (in terms of interest and aptitude). But despite spending so much more time studying for my science and maths subjects, history and geography were my only A1s for my O-Levels.In the early weeks of JC I took a leap of faith and transferred from a Bio-Chem-Maths-Econ combi to a more humanities/social science-centric one. In retrospect it was one of the best decisions I ever made. In fact, if anything, I regret taking H2 rather than H1 math. I spent 65%-70% of my time studying for H2 math compared to my other subjects combined, and I have forgotten almost all the math I studied (although I still have a relatively decent understanding of the arts subjects I studied).In JC it is going to be even tougher. The students taking natural science subjects will generally be those who did well in those subjects for their O-levels (or the year 4 IP exams). And the same will be the case for uni. I am not discounting the possibility that hard work can turn things around, but you have to be aware that there will be students who will have a very high aptitude for the natural sciences who are willing to work as hard as you are (or even harder). Additionally, there are many courses at NUS that one can pursue if one’s strengths are in arts subjects such as those offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and Faculty of Law to name a few. I have seen far too many students choose a course in uni they lacked an interest in only to regret it afterwards (it can be a very long 3-4 years).You seem to be suggesting that you are more inclined to studying arts subjects. If so, you may wish to consider pursuing this route in JC. Studying something you enjoy and are good at is truly a double blessing. That being said, what subjects to pursue in JC is ultimately a choice only you can make for yourself and I wish you all the best in making your decision.-#96775: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96775",10,2,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

#96762,17/3/2021,"Dating advice Just some bit of context of my life first - I went to NUS for half a sem, didn’t enjoy the course I was doing but couldn’t get into the course that I wanted (med) hence I ended up going to australia to pursue my passion. I’ve since graduated and have been working as a doctor for 5 years now, and I’m now 30 and still single, and have just moved back to Singapore.I’ve been trading big in the stock market (I made some pretty risky moves with my salary and savings - basically I went all or nothing) and with luck on my side, I made pretty big gains as well, and have cashed out earlier this year post the bull run around the time I’ve moved back to Singapore. I’ve indulged quite a little and bought a $12M house in a posh district as an investment, and I’ve also bought a brand new jaguar for me and my family to share. (I decided with my parents that we were going to stay in our old place - a 5 room HDB flat in the east which we have been occupying for 20 years now), and rent out my investment property for more income.Anyways to the dating side of things - My friend recommended I use a dating app to try and meet someone and it’s just led to nowhere.  And this is where I really need some genuine advice.Long story short, I’ve realized that when my profile depicts my occupation and a better glimpse of my nett worth, I get way way way more interested girls (yes I’m a dude) than if I were to not. I discovered this when I made a profile in one dating app and another in a very similar dating app. In the first app I basically put in the very basics - eg a picture of me with friends, one with my family, me posing awkwardly with a selfie along ECP, my fav hawker meal, and I’ve just put down “lots of admin” under my job description as that was genuinely what I did, and my lifestyle. I then got about 5-6 matches (over the course of 4 weeks and probably hundreds of swipes later..) which apparently was not a lot but I didn’t know that since it was my first time using a dating app. The Conversations also died down really quickly. Anyway, my friend told me it was pathetic.Anyway, she then helped me remake my profile in the next dating app - which was extremely similar to the first one. I couldn’t redo my first profile as the swipes were permanent. Anyway this time round she set up my pictures of me with my new car (which I barely drive at all since my parents used it way more) and my new house (which I’m not technically even living in) and put down my occupation as “doctor”. I just laughed it off and left it as that. Oddly enough, I received likes in nearly 30% of my swipes (yes I swipe right to most people as I thought I didn’t stand a chance anyway) this time and got about 70 or so matches in 1 week. Within the next 2 months i had dates lined up nearly every day or two (which was pretty difficult given my work schedule). And to be honest I felt like I got along well with many of my dates - ie we were compatible? But I can’t help but be troubled by the fact that some of them potentially were not genuine with me? Reason why I thought so was because there were a couple of them that I remembered swiping right on in the first app, and I didn’t match with them? I thought it was a coincidence initially - eg maybe they didn’t see my profile, but then I started recalling more and more profiles from the first app I never matched with after swiping right. There was also one date who asked if she could come back to my place, which I said no to since my parents wouldn’t like it, but I caved in on the second date and brought her home, and she was a bit off and wanted to leave early from my flat. Basically it started going downhill after she asked about the house I took a picture with in my DP and I just told her that I don’t live there and laughed it off. Another date also totally bombed when I showed up after toking a bus there.My question is this, what should I do?! I did not stand a chance with anyone from my first profile and I did with my second but i am now feeling that it wasn’t who I am that attracts these girls. I am really lonely and want a companion and potentially future wife - which I can’t get at all from my first profile since I can’t even strike a date, but on my second profile it’s the flip side, where there are heaps of girls who are interested but I do not know if they’re genuine. I would want to know for sure that the other party is genuine before progressing any further in a relationship and marriage.. any advice would be greatly appreciated.

#96708,17/3/2021,"I've known my spouse for about 10 years now and married for 4, going 5. No kids, and we are both professionals with full time careers. Seems like the perfect couple, but only we are not.My world came crushing down couple of weeks ago when I found out about an emotional affair, apparently over the last few months or more.I should have seen it coming, the change in behaviour, the mood swings, the secrecy in texting, the sudden bursts of gifts (to me). To the effect that I've expressed concern about our marriage and this friend, to which the replies were, ""I can very happy and contented with our marriage, why do you keep over thinking and complicating things?"" or ""it's just a platonic friendship why can't you give me the freedom to have friends outside of our marriage?""I respected that, and gave both of us the benefit of doubt. Until one faithful weekend. Again secretly texting the other party right while sitting beside me and our friends, sending photos and smiling at the phone. I lost it and went to snoop further the next day (I know this is wrong but I just couldn't take it anymore). One can imagine the rage, anger, despair, fear, disappointment, hopelessness when I found out about it all. And no doubt there were screams and tears, endless tears till now, and I am still feeling like an empty shell. It felt like I'm the third party breaking up a pair of perfectly in love couple. It felt like I've been living in my own little bubble of lies. It felt like all the joke's on me. I asked if they have thought of divorcing their respective spouses to get together, I asked if they were truly in love, and I was only met with silence. And this silence speaks louder than words, and felt like a sharp blade stabbing at me, repeatedly. Yet my other half proclaimed to be really sorry and regretful for all the hurt imposed on me and was willing to end it and refocus on us. I might be an overthinker, but I also don't want to go down without a fight. Even if it does end up with the inevitable, I want to be honest with myself that I've given my all to try and make it work. A no regret move, I suppose. If anything, I realise I still love my other half deeply, but the pain on some days are just so hard to bear. The triggers, the behaviours, the associations... How long more can I take this? Some days when I look out the window I'd think maybe if I just jump down, all my problems and pain will be gone, and they can be together and be truly happy. But then I think of my parents and those who care for me, I realise that's a very selfish move. But who else can I turn to? I can't tell my family or friends, because that's an immediate marriage suicide. I can't keep talking about the pain I'm feeling else I'll be the nagging spouse only to push them closer together. I came across some marriage vows the other day, ""... in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others keep thee only unto her/him as long as you both shall live?""Am I the only hopelessly naive individual to think that people still enter a monogamous marriage willingly, and has the discipline to stay true to the other party? Or has the times changed so much that marriage is no longer sacred and we ought to be more chillax and frivolous, because, YOLO, ya-know.. I need help. I need assurance. And I need hope that everything will be alright. But who else can I turn to?

#96694,17/3/2021,"I got pregnant and was forced to marry a guy who is a cheater as well as a gambler with tons of debts, or choose to get disowned by my family. He has been jobless for months and tried to scam my parents money previously using sympathy and out of my parents love for me. My love and respect for this man has died ever since.I have more savings compared to people my age group, as I am someone who is frugal and works hard in life, the only mistake I did in life is to not open my eyes big enough and fell for the wrong guy, but I do not regret getting pregnant as I have always wanted a child. Initially, my plan was to wait and see how this man would value-add to my life, change or contribute towards helping to raise the kid as the stigma of being a single mother is still there, but as time passes, this man whom I once loved has been jobless for almost a year and haven’t really been trying hard to find a job nor contribute in any way. All he does is play games, gamble online, don’t even bother to return his loans to me or my family, and watch Netflix all day.It seems like even though I’m pregnant and giving birth, he does not seem to worry that he has to work harder to contribute to the family, he can’t even feed himself, and expects me to pay for all the expenses just because I have savings. And whenever he finds me, he expects me to have sex with him and pleasure him even though I’m close to giving birth.I have read a lot of nus whisperer stories that say that singaporean girls are materialistic and go for guys with good prospects and income, whereas foreign girls do not. However, I would beg to differ. All girls would love to be doted and taken care of by their husband, which girl wouldn’t? But in this case if the man doesn’t step up, until which point should a foolish wife continue to stay with him despite his disloyalty, debts and attitude, I don’t think any foreign girls would be foolish enough still to stick around, and I definitely do not want to have to work harder in future to feed an extra mouth just because I was forced into this situation.-#96694: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96694",65,16,0,55,0,89,0,39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

This may be the cause of his obession. Initially he bought 2 cars, one for my mom n one for him. When my sister got her license, he bought another car for her. Doesnt really make sense as my mom doesnt drive often so my sister could have shared it. When i got my license he bought another car using the reason that the first car has only about a year left. Now my younger sister is taking her license n instead of discouraging him to buy another car, she is encouraging him as she wants this specific car model. Obv he got excited as someone in this family is into cars as well n most likely will buy her that car once she gets her license. Also he loves antique cars n has 2 of them stored in Malaysia. Am i overreacting or is this getting out of hand?  Btw the first car has been scrapped n the second one has less than year left, hopefully he doesnt buy any new cars after this.

My wife's uncle is a Malaysian and he has nearly S$100 mil in real estate, earning roughly S$5 mil a year on rent alone. He is single, without children, and he wants to move to Singapore because he thinks the infrastructure in Malaysia is not suitable for retirement. He has never worked a job. He started a distribution company in his early 30s, which he sold many years back, after which he used the money to fund his purchase of a commercial office building in KL, worth around 330-350 million MYR.

#96673,17/3/2021,"My dad is very conservatively Chinese and he has already passed on his entire asset portfolio (shares of an investment company) to my elder brother, who is 30 this year. I’m a girl and my dad has told me categorically that I will get nothing. Not that I feel I am entitled to receive anything, it’s ultimately their choice. But I just don’t like what it is doing to my brother. My brother is now a 100% owner in an investment company with a passive revenue of a little more than $2 mil with an extremely high margin. As far as I know, the business requires very little effort to run. My dad has been doing it for years and it doesn’t seem like he’d been working. My brother has quit his day job as a management consultant at an MBB company a year ago, and has since been doing nothing at home. It can’t bear the sight of watching him waste his life away.I’ve always admired my brother, who is 5 years older than I am. He went to RI/RJC, and then he graduated summa cum laude from UPenn. He had always wanted to become a professor but decided against that life the minute he inherited my dad’s business. I had always imagined he’d go on to do great things with his life, but now he has no life. My brother is also the extremely frugal type. He probably takes after my dad. He still lives with them in my parents’ 3-bedroom HDB. He spends very little on things and eats out at hawker centers on most days, dolled up in his secondary school PE shorts and army singlet. He hasn’t had a girlfriend, he doesn’t go out with friends, the last I asked him he told me he doesn’t want to date or to be married. He has always been a massive loner with very few interests, so it’s just really sad to see how boring his life is. Since he took over the company, he has given me 200K every year. I appreciate it very much because he has always doted on me. But I just wish he had someone or something who could give his life meaning. My best friend, Sara, has been close to my family for years, since we were in P1. She recently showed a bit of interest in my brother, since he is really kind, really loving, really loyal, really smart. The only problem is she’s very outgoing and my brother is honestly just very boring. The way I see it, I don’t think it will work out but she says she needs the stability in her life. Is it advisable for me to set her up with my bro, knowing that she’s probably going to end up very frustrated with my brother’s lack of desire to do anything? I also wouldn’t want to make things difficult for my brother if he really enjoys his reclusive lifestyle.

#96663,17/3/2021,"Am I an asshole for scolding my bf for selling investment plans to my parents?So my bf has been an insurance agent/financial planner before we even got together, and I'm supportive of his career choice. We've been together for slightly over a year and we've met each other's parents a couple of times already. Still, he has only met my parents about 5 times since we only meet up as a family for gatherings like someone's birthday or CNY.My bf had told me that he wanted to sell insurance/investment plans to my parents and I said no, because I didn't want my parents to think badly of him. You know, the stigma around insurance agents/financial planners. Then, I just found out that he sold an investment plan to my parents. He waited for me to leave the house to settle some errands and then talked my parents into buying the plan.Thing is, the plan looks absolutely horrible. My parents have to pay 50k a year for 5 years. They will then get a lump sump back at the end of the 5 years with interest. My parents are retired, and they have about 300k in cash savings. This means they have to set aside 250k in their bank to pay for these 5 years, which means this plan is locking their retirement money which could be put in some other investment plans/stocks. This also means that they only have 50k to spend for the next 5 years which I think is definitely not enough. I feel like this plan is more suited for people who are still drawing an income and can set aside 50k a year to save, and not for people with the actual cash in hand now in retirement. If anything, they should be buying a plan that dumps 250k in now, then withdrawing X amount a year instead.Now my parents are quite happy with the plan, saying that it has a good interest and all, and my bf is happy that he earned the commission and has somewhat gained respect from my parents as a financial planner. My parents are really not financially literate and the money they have now is from their lifetime of saving. They do not have much cpf because they were self employed (small provision shop). I have not told my parents how stupid this plan is because I'm afraid they'd start to hate my bf or they'd just not trust me, but I feel like it is my duty to protect my parents' interest. Also, they are very stubborn and I feel like I will not be able to convince them to cancel the plan.There's still time to cancel the plan without any fees but I'm in a real dillema now... My bf is disagreeing that this plan is stupid, and he said my parents have the right to invest in whatever they want without my approval, and he emphasized that they are happy with it. What should I do? I've told him to bring up cancelling the plan instead else I'd do it instead and he said I'm putting him in a spot.-#96663: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96663",273,95,98,0,28,109,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

#96649,17/3/2021,"Just a few thoughts that I have. A disclaimer: They definitely won't apply to everybody but these are just some of my feelings!  Sometimes I feel that life is essentially made up of challenges, obstacles, and situations that help to determine my role within it. These past couple years, while I keep on trying to find a certain type of happiness within life, I keep encountering situations that seem to suggest to me otherwise, that the time has not come for me to attain that yet. I really cherish the friendships that I have forged over the years and I will always remain grateful for them  Now, after all this time, I feel that my path has been becoming clearer and clearer: To help my friends attain the happiness that they deserve and to always be happy and there for them once that have achieved it. Even though I can't seem to possess what they have, I should and always remain by their side and help them to greater heights while I hide my present emotions. As each day passes, this role gets clearer and clearer. Deep down in my heart, I still hope that one day, I will be able to experience what they had. Then maybe, my role in life will be changed to a different one! So sorry if this sounds so weird haha. Thanks for listening and have a safe and great day yall!

I have spoken to my supervisor two times to voice my concerns, and I was told not to worry that I don’t have any big projects on hand now, and was asked to read up on more research. I feel quite useless because of this, and I feel sad that I am quite free (I know it’s weird that I’m actually complaining that I am stressed over not having enough work to do when others are stressed with too much work to do). I am naturally someone who likes to keep myself busy and I would prefer to be stressed over being busy than stressed over being too free.

#96642,17/3/2021,"Pardon me, i really just need to rant and let it out somewhere.I've been in a vicious cycle. I'm a very introverted person, a homebody, and someone who has a superrr small social circle. Heck, i dont even talk to these friends very often as they're all living their own lives and are at a different phase from me. Because of this, I often feel lonely and want to have someone to talk to. Everytime i make a new friend (mostly from online, we havent even met irl), we chat a lot at the beginning, maybe the first few days, sometimes 1-2weeks. During this period of chatting, I feel really happy because we get along well and i want this newly formed friendship to last a long time. However, I get emotionally attached super easily and will start to feel sad when i realise that we are running out of things to talk about. I understand that it is natural and friends do not need to talk every single day, but it just doesnt feel good. With my type of personality, I always end up thinking that the person has lost interest in me and i'm going to lose another friend and feel empty all over again. (Clingy/needy af, i know)I try my best to carry the conversation, ask questions, share about myself, send links to new food places, dog videos, funny memes etc. Even if we both expressed that we want to maintain this friendship, slowly i can see the other party's replies getting shorter and responses are no longer like before. I get tired of being the only one putting in the effort, eventually the convo died and i lost another friend.Now, i'm back to feeling empty and alone because after a period of daily chatting, i got no one to talk to again. And then this whole vicious cycle continues...I'm drained from this whole shit but idk what to do...

We were introduced by my ex bf who’s his friend, and got closer cuz we went to the same poly and spent a lot of time together. I don’t know whether he ever had romantic feelings for me back, cuz he admits he treats me specially (delivering free bubble tea to my work & home, sending me home, picking me up after drinking etc). He also introduced me to his parents & some of his close friends to try to help me open up & meet new ppl. When I talked to his friends, most of them tell me they suspect he has feelings for me but he won’t admit cuz of the special way he only treats me and shares his secrets with me. He also still brings me to his meetups with friends and work gatherings, we support each other emotionally and go out a lot though he is busy with work.While he rejected me a few years back when I confessed to him, we both stayed single since then. I’ve tried going on dating apps but it never worked out cuz I know I still have feelings for him. I think he’s tried dating too but he says he has no time & interest now cuz of his job. He claims he sees me as a younger sister that’s why we’re so close and he takes care of me. We both don’t talk about romance tho we’re very comfortable with each other and can talk abt anything else having long convos every day.

However, some part of me wonders if that’s enough. I had an interest in the past who I had a unique connection with, where we were always in sync and could connect over anything and everything. Other than just sharing very similar life values, we had very similar thought processes and worldviews which made it easy for him to understand the life trajectory I’m on and why I make certain choices in life. While it’s not like I want to return to this past interest, I just wonder what is enough in a long term relationship. Often, I see people say that love (feelings) is not enough if there is no effort. What if the effort is there but we are just not fundamentally in sync? For eg, maybe sharing about some things, I know he will support me and encourage me but he does not share the same thoughts and may not understand why I choose to do certain things. I want the r/s to work and I’m grateful to have such a good person in life - and that’s why I want to be sure that this will not become an issue in the future, or perhaps I’m just looking for some wise words to dissuade me from constantly thinking about that one sync connection that I know a part of me craves.

#96603,17/3/2021,"Recently my ex-boyfriend broke up with me and I really find him extremely unfair to me. We’ve been together for almost 4 years, just a few months before we hit our 4th anniversary, but he decided to end things with me because of this fxxking covid-19 issue.Ever since we are allowed to hangout and dine-out after 2 months of lockdown last year, things began to change. He hates hangout out and waiting for long queues. Because all eateries have to practise safe social distancing, so restaurant, cafes, and even hawker centres and foodcourts can’t accommodate full house dining, so like 50% of the tables are empty, therefore people have to queue outside. Just imagine popular places like ding tai fung already have long queue before covid-19, now it’s just getting worse. My ex has very bad patience, so whenever we hung out, he got very frustrated whenever we had to queue, and there were many times we ended up eating at less popular eateries that we don’t even like. Even at foodcourts also we had a hard time finding a table. It’s like everywhere we go, be it shopping mall or restaurants outside, there will always be a queue, so he just got sick of waiting.My ex is quite fit, I would say he is a gym junkie who workout 5-6 days a week. Even on days when I just want to chill and rest at home, he would go to the gym too since we can’t meet. Although he is muscular, he also does cardio activities like cycling, HIIT and jogging. But he dislikes wearing a mask because it gives him breathing difficulty. I know this sounds ridiculous because my friends and I who don’t even gym or exercise have no problem hanging out with mask on, but when I saw him sweating so much, face turning red, and gasping for air when we hung out, I feel guilty for hanging out with him. He told me that he doesn’t like to hangout anymore because wearing mask just makes him difficult to breathe. Even after trying different masks, it’s still the same, he doesn’t seem to be able to breathe normally. Another problem is when he gets hot and stuffy, his mood would turn bad too, so those happy meet-ups actually turned out to be moody and sad.As he can no longer accept this kind of dating lifestyle, he initiated to breakup with me. He said given this fxxked up covid-19 situation, all he wants is just to stay at home and just takeaway simple food nearby his place during weekend. I’m actually fine with it too because I know this is not gonna be permanent, but he feels that this so-called new normal is not going to end anytime soon, and we are expected to be masked on for at least a few years, so he doesn’t want to waste my time.Enough of ranting, I just hope you guys can give me some advice on how I should approach him because I really want to patch back and be with him again.

#96594,17/3/2021,"Rant post here: Having been married with my wife for more than 7 years, had two kids, our precovid years prior were more or less happy and satisfactory although not entirely smooth sailing. Due to covid and issues at her workplace, my wife quit her job and she starts to have doubts in the marriage. Minus off all the details and complicated stuffs, we decided to go open relationship to maybe bring some sparks and life to our own lives and marriage as well. The bottom line is even if we have puppy love with outside lovers, the spouse and family comes first. She initiated this arrangement with video chat with others first, then into irl meet ups. Of course I wasn't initially happy with this arrangement but she wasn't feeling happy no matter what and I thought by doing this she would be happy. How I've erred. The current bf she's with initially I've met with him as well and I was OK with how she described him as a person with a sense of justice and positivity. I've should have known a person who's willing to sleep with others wife even if she's in an open relationship wouldn't have these traits. Before long, he started to ask her to divorce me, even though he doesn't like kids, he's willing to take care. He even mentioned to her he's willing to sell of his assets to take care of them. It was also after that my wife found out he's inheriting tens of millions from his deceased stepfather.During the whole process my wife's hinted that she had fallen in love with him, and it was never about the money. Then came the most selfish and heartbreaking moment I've experienced in my life. On the day of my birthday, she told me she had wanted to arrange for some nice starvation event for us but since I've arranged already she never went through(she never even mentioned it before aNyway till that day). Then she told me she wanted to divorce amicably.... I was devastated, who in the right mind would say such things on a person's birthday. After we talked it out, she says she will head to the bf side to talk things out and try to break it off. In the end, she only went back to our room late in the morning.... With love bites all over her body that she purposefully asked her bf to plant... And suddenly the entire marriage there wasn't anything I did right and all the things she did was not wrongIn the end, I told her if she want to divorce, she can pack her bags and leave the house immediately. I will also cease all the money that I give her and pays for her. Yup, during this whole time she was also using the money I gave her while unemployed to go out with her bf. After a series talks, we agreed to break off any arrangements we have outside of marriage after a month. In this month I wouldn't care about what she does. But... The betrayal and the hints that she gave... Makes me doubtful she will entirely break off, even if she really does breaks off, if it's just me who wants to fix out marriage but she doesn't want to put in the effort to fix our marriage, I do not see the future as being happy. Now I'm at a dilemma to whether to divorce and fight for the care and control of my kids, or try to trust her and fix the marriage. I do have some friends who advice just let the judge decide and if she takes the care and control, let her n her bf take care while I go free and single. But for me my main concern is I want my children to have a whole loving family that neither of us have (she says her bf family is really loving and is the kind she's looking for, unlike my family whose dysfunctional as compared to a normal family).-#96594: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96594",22,2,0,0,0,14,0,13,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

Idg why people want to project this idea of the materialistic gold digger vs selfless women, sacrificing all, being loyal even if the bloke has no money, nothing and even glamourise it on dating apps. It just sounds like you are lazy and does not seek self improvement. Times are changing. Ladies are working and earning their keep. They dont need atms, but a emotionally mature individual who can support each other. But they still get the short end most of the time. As for why ladies may still go for the traditional patriarchal route of being the ""lesser"" earner.... well keep that insecurities and ego in check and confidence up if you dont want to unconciously end up on the wrong side of statistics. And when you make a decision out of pride, dont regret it and make a fool of yourself.https://www.sbs.com.au/.../women-are-more-likely-to...-#96591: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96591",15,2,0,0,4,30,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
#96584,17/3/2021,"Advice needed!! Currently I'm in a 2-year master programme in urban planning, and studio work takes up a huge portion of the curriculum. There is this girl who always free rides and I've grouped with her for studio twice already. Last semester I accepted fate, but this semester I'm really angry that it's still group grading for this 8 mcs mod, and it's just super unfair to us. In the first few weeks of the semester, when our studio group was having discussions, she always talked about useless things such as ""the other day I did something"", or she would only say ""ok"" or ""I tried but it's too hard to find what y'all want..."". Then these weeks she attended our group meetings, but she was there just to do other things!! She did her individual assignments, she was chatting with friends, she was even shopping online... Then we cannot tolerate her anymore, so my friend went to talk to her, asked her if she could keep up and if she could contribute to our studio work. Still, she talked about some useless stuff, trying to make it our fault that we always agree with each other so she doesn't want to speak up (actually the rest of us argue against each other a lot on studio). Nothing has changed even after we talked to her.So we reached out to the TA for help, see if there's anything the tutors of the studio can do. Then we were told that this stupid studio is still group grading (but the tutors said it's indiv grading at the beginning). We asked for a peer evaluation for indiv grading, but the TA said the tutors think peer review is biased and they don't want it. I was like:????? Last sem was zoom lesson so I can understand indiv grading is quite hard as they can't really observe each person's contribution. Then this sem they meet us every week for a whole day, they still say it's difficult to observe? The whole class can tell the girl is free riding, but they can't???Our group has been doing quite good for the studio since the beginning, and I think our grade is not gonna be bad. It's just so unfair that the freeloader can share the grade as what we've been putting effort into, and she literally did NOTHING. I'm so angry now, and we tried everything we can do. The tutors are just lazy to deal with this thing. I didn't meet any professors and lecturers like this during my 4-year undergrad in NUS. Now I know the tutors in master programme in NUS are so irresponsible... We just want an individual grade that is fair to everyone................. What should I and my group do now? I want to email the programme director for this thing but I don't know if I should do it.... The final crit is in week 13 so I have to solve this issue asap.......-#96584: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96584",11,1,0,3,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
#96581,17/3/2021,"Can a girl and guy really just be close friends and nothing else ?We’ve known each other for close to 3 years. We met through a mutual friend and have been hanging out since then. We do not meet every single week or rather, the frequency is pretty irregular, due to her studies and my commitments.We usually meet up for a meal to hang out and she would offer to drive around too. She had already caught my attention when I first met her which was the reason why we remained in contact after that first encounter. It was after texts and time spent together that got us knowing each other better. But I know she just treats me as a friend. Confessed to her once and.. yup u know what happened. Let’s just call my crush dinosaur. She would often asks me for advice as what she should do because she liked a particular guy. Sometimes I wished she was hinting that it’s me, but it’s not. Lol.After confession, things went back to normal and as if nothing happened. After that period I started hanging out with this colleague and things didn’t went really well. Meanwhile, Dinosaur and I at that period of time was rather quiet and didn’t hung out as much as before too. We were both busy with our own lives. But we were aware of what we were going on with. Eventually I broke things off with the girl.Honestly I really liked dinosaur but I knew both of us are kinda impossible. I had good impression of her, goods feelings but tried to not fall deep into it because I know both of us are likely going nowhere, judging from the questions she asked me before. To cover up the fact that I’ve gotten over her, ill often pop questions like ways to ask a girl out or whatever it is to cover up my feelings for her. I didn’t want things to turn awkward. There was once she asked in a rather timid manner about how are things going between me and the girl, and I just said it’s over. She gave me the impression that she’s wanting to try, maybe I’m thinking too much. When we hung out, i really felt we were a couple, except without holding of hands, lol.I know I’ve kinda screwed things up. But sometimes the questions she asks me makes me feel like I’ve a chance. We’ve been hanging out together, Idk if u would even call it a date. We are good now and idw to make things awkward if i were to pop any question to ask if we are really just close friends, or there’s a chance of becoming of than friends. Right now, I’m just staying by her side and always there for her.Rather annoyed, lost, and disappointed. What should i do? Are we really just friends?

#96568,17/3/2021,"Okay so i have been holding this for very long. So basically i met this girl through a friend and online game. Basically we were playing game everyday ever since we talked, and we can be in the same call for almost 10hours or more. So slowly i developed feelings for her and decided to just confess. Then slowly we became closer and closer and sometimes i will go to her house. Even though like it was quite far but i just went. So here's the thing. Last time when we just started talking she'll stay online to maybe text for 10-20 mins max. But now we when text, at most is 1-2 text then she'll go offline and reply maybe 5mins later. But now whenever i see that she is able to reply others instant but not me it just felt really depressing. And she told me that she don't reply instant but after those incident (still happening) idk what i should even feel about it. Now that we've gotten closer, and we started playing with our friends, most of the time she'll ask me to call them instead of like last time where the call will be just the two of us. We even spoke about jealously this matter and what i don't really like. I just don't know how to react to these situations.  I personally don't like to see my gf having so much laughter and fun with other people.

We both love the independent and carefree lifestyle. However, he recently asked me if we want to get married at least in name. His parents have been asking him about settling down even though he doesn’t really want to. If we were to get ‘married’, we could have each other’s company and have someone to rely on in times of need. We would agree not to have any kids. Financially wise, he holds a high paying job and is from a rich background so he is okay to support me should I lose my job etc, which gives me some security. It is a special marriage where we could keep each other company when needed and yet can lead our own independence lives and free to go out, party with other friends etc without any question from the other party. According to him, we can also enjoy privileges such as getting a bto (if not each of us have to wait till 35), grants, reliefs etc for married people. I am very tempted to accept his proposal.

#96537,17/4/2021,"After 6 years working in public service, I feel stagnant and interest in my work has nosedived. I think many of my peers feel the same way and we wonder if we should make a career switch into the private sector. Especially with the hypergrowth of the tech industry, FOMO is real and we fear that this would be our last chance to try jumping out to the private sector, before age catches up in our thirties. While we are thankful to have a stable job, we also wonder if there is more to life than being a servant of the bureaucracy.I have seen many public servants toiling at the same job for decades. Many stay on because of the stability, but most of them have grown jaded and resentful, simply because the sense of stagnation has eaten away at them. To all those who have faced this crossroads before - should I take a gamble and make a switch now to the private sector, or should I just stick it out and find opportunities in the service? I have no debt and no kids at this point in time, so financially I have some leeway. However, moving also entails losing out on career progression in the service (simply by virtue of seniority). My interest is in tech and data analytics. While there is huge demand for this in the private sector, the competition is also intense and I worry about job prospects and stability. I have honed my skills through constant self-practice but I’m now at a stage where I find it hard to improve further without learning from the industry.

Most of our dates involve chilling at each other’s houses, just quietly doing our own things. While I try my best to accommodate his preference of staying home, once in a while I feel a tinge of jealousy when I see my guy friends excitedly researching on nice places to take their gf to, planning and dressing up for special occasions etc.I did try to plan our dates before, but always met with reluctance from him. For example, when I tell him about food places I want to try, he coldly replies the food is most likely not nice and overpriced, and he prefers home cooked food. When I tell him about some events or classes I am interested in, he just brushes it off, or sometimes he claims he can’t go because he needs to stay home and do work. But in the end he just wastes the time away playing games / surfing the net, very frustrating tbh.FYI I don’t even suggest very expensive places to go to, don’t expect him to pay for everything although he earns a lot and can afford it, and also not very often (once a week). I am thinking perhaps doing things together outside our homes once in a while will help us de-stress and spice up our relationship. Also, honestly I’m very tired of cooking for him when we’re home, moreover he doesn’t help with the washing/cleaning after.

I would suggest you really talk things out with him and explain your feelings (you don’t know his rationale for such actions either). if he makes it clear he’s not interested, it would be much easier on yourself to give clear boundaries on how you should act around each other eg. maybe give a longer break inbetween meeting up, keep physical contact at a minimum, only say things to him via text or irl that you would say to any regular guy friend. basically treat him exactly as you would any of your other guy friends, and make sure he treats you similar to how they (yr guy friends) would treat you. niceness is one thing but its not going to help in your situation. it does take time for your mindset to switch and it doesnt help at all when both parties actions make it fuzzy.finally, know that you certainly deserve someone willing to take a definite chance on you! and that you are strong enough to deal with whatever happens. good luck! -#96507: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96507",0,3,0,1,0,18,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#96505,17/3/2021,"Dear #96393,Reading your confession and all the comments/advice that came with it was really helpful, and made me feel less alone. I think I found it really striking that there are so many similarities to what I've been going through - or maybe I just feel so desperate and alone that I'm drawing up links to whatever I can.Like you, I've spent the last eight months pining over a guy I cannot have. Like you, I don't have anyone I can talk to about this. Except he was the one who confessed and chased me, and the reason I haven't been able to talk to anyone about this is so I can protect his identity. Long story short, he is not someone available to me, and even despite the confessing and chasing from his end, he has made it abundantly clear that we can never be together, that he'll never be able to choose me. The words have been laid down from the beginning in black and white, and never mind that he was the one who initiated this, who pursued this, but he was also the one who refused to let go, to let me move on. Maybe it was hard for him too, because I know his feelings were real, and he was constantly battling between his heart and mind. But the truth is what it is, and the mixed signals were really tiring - he would be saying one thing, but doing the complete opposite.  Every time I thought I could move on, he would suddenly resurface in my life again, and I would get dragged back into the same cycle, over and over again. He completely messed with my mind - I was so exhausted, not just physically (from not being able to sleep), but also emotionally and mentally. Not to say I blame him - in reality, I'm to blame too, because I could easily put my foot down and cut him off, even if he shows up once again. But it was hard, I won't deny... when his words hurt me I think there's no reason to hold on, and then he shows up and his eyes and actions say something else. Then there're also the times when his words are everything I want to hear, but his actions cut me to the core. Or sometimes everything is in sync, and then suddenly, something happens and he awakens to reality/has a sudden realization, and then once again, everything is not. I don't know which is worse - not having your feelings returned, or having your feelings returned but knowing you'll never be able to be together. To be honest, I also have a general sense of feeling cheated, because why even stir up these feelings if you know you'll never be able to give me anything? And if you know you can't give me anything, why not let me move on?? He kept giving me mixed signals - in both words and actions. He tells me to move on and find my own happiness, but every time it seems like I'm moving on, he holds on even more, and then he'll say or do something and all of a sudden I'm back at that same spot once again. I've cried all the tears there is to cry, over the past eight months. At first it was every day, sometimes multiple times a day, but now I don't even cry anymore- I'm just numb. I've learnt that life still goes on even if you're desperately sad, that you can still function. Is that a sign of healing? Right now we're in this pocket of space where we haven't talked for awhile, as agreed - will it last this time? Do I honestly want it to? It would be so easy to just go back to that time and place, to that space where you forget everything and everyone else. So easy to just cave... Honestly, that would make me very happy, even if it's just hearing his voice or seeing him again, but deep down I know that that's just short term happiness, because it would just mean even more pain in the long run once again. Sometimes I confuse even myself...But I think eventually I realized that even if both parties feel the same, it doesn't matter if the other party isn't willing to fight for you. You don't need to wonder about the reasons why - why it can't work, why you have to let go, why the other person is doing this, what the other person can possibly be thinking or feeling. In the end, if they're not going to fight for you, then you have to be the one to walk away. That's the rational side of me speaking. As you can see, my mind and heart are in constant battles with each other too. But let's both walk away. I hope we're both able to. (I'm so sorry if this is all over the place, but understand that it's eight months worth of pent up emotions and thoughts. I hope you feel better soon. And everyone, if you can just give some advice / constant reminder of what I should do, please do. I'll be so grateful for any little encouragement, because in all honestly, this is really hard, and there's no one I can talk to or confide in, no one who can whack some sense into me. And I'm so afraid I'll cave once again, because really, that'll be so easy to do.)-#96505: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96505",7,2,0,5,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
#96502,17/3/2021,"Dear admin, pls post this.To the guy who's been in love with me for idk how long (I wonder):I find that one of the hardest things is to not reciprocate/move on from someone who has a lot of love for you.. It pains me so much to try to walk away from you..you are starting to make me see what true love might look like. What did I ever do.. for you to love me so much? You just make me lose my words sometimes. Why do you keep showering me with affection? Why me?I am scared to even speak to you, I am scared I might fall in love with you. I don’t want to. What if things don’t work out in the long run? I am not ready to lose you and this friendship. I am scared to reciprocate.I don’t even mind me getting hurt, but I will definitely not do anything to cause you pain. This is the least I could do after all the affection you have shown me. You might think I have forgotten all the things you have done for me in all these years.. but really, never ever will I forget! You are as precious to me as I am to you. The first time we spoke many years back, I definitely felt something different about you. I have never told you this, but I knew you were not any other random guy I would come across. At that point, I didn’t think of it as a liking of those sorts but I liked your presence at the very least. Still remember the last time I met you tho. I think it was at a bus interchange haha, it was a coincidental meet. It was a quick few minutes of talk that we had, but is still a good memory on my mind. Seems very nostalgic now. And then, when we got in touch, I liked this friendship and you as a friend..I still do. You haven’t told me this directly but I know. I know you have a lot of love for me. I am scared everytime I come in contact with you..scared you might ask me if I reciprocate your love. Now, I have started to create a small distance between us but I really hope you don’t think it is because I hate you or whatsoever. This distance is for us to not feel as hurt if we have to part ways eventually. You don’t understand how much it pains me to even say this. There is a lot of fear in me with this friendship and the uncertainty about the future. I don’t even know if I am doing the right thing by creating a distance between us. I wish I could make this situation better..Any opinions or advice on this situation is greatly appreciated.-#96502: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96502",16,10,0,8,0,23,0,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
#96501,17/3/2021,"Opinions needed! I had physical intimacy with a guy whom I like, 6 months into my first relationship. I love him, he loves me, I don't see why not. Today during a heated conversation with my parents on other issues, I let it slipped that I had sex with a guy. They tell me honestly that, they don't think I have enough self love and that I'm like a prostitute, having sex with random guy that I like only 6 months in a relationship. Then they expressed their disappointment in me. (And hatred for the guy, saying the guy did not respect them by having sex with me without even meeting them yet)I really don't know what to do. It makes me feel really sad and I wonder if this is really the case, that I may have been too rash and I don't have as much self love as I thought I had, orit's just how the old people's mind set. It's just kinda sad for me to think that my parents now have this opinion of me. I'm so ashamed. I know they love me still but this really makes me doubt my self worth. It's also my first relationship, so I'm not sure if I had done this right. Friends, is there really an unspoken rule on how long you have to wait before you have sex in a relationship?

#96500,17/3/2021,"TL;DR — Bf (26M) did some shady shit that broke my (23M) trust, I am not so sure of our relationship anymore. Known and got together with my current boyfriend for less than a year. 3 months into our relationship, bf went to meet online bff (female) for dinner — told me was supposedly 3 pax but last person went MIA. I didn’t feel right in my gut but tried to be understanding. I couldn’t hide being upset, voiced out and he came over to my place to talk things out. At this point my mentality was “you came because you did something wrong and now you feel guilty”. Anyway, this was resolved the same night. I found out earlier this month this was false. The dinner was planned with only both of them in mind right from the start. I didn’t voice this out to him since it’s long over so I’m penning it down here. It really fucking sucks to know about this lol. Next, on the same day when I found out about the above, I also found that my bf and this guy (whom he only knows for less than 3 months) were talking about/planning to go to sleazy massage parlours in Feb. THIS I obviously could not keep mum about this because what the fuck????  We talked about this and came to a conclusion: for obvious reasons he will cut off contact with him. Of course, my bf also had to work on himself for whatever he said to the guy, or for even entertaining it. I gave him the benefit of doubt based on the timeline of response which was also his defense — he was merely entertaining the guy and tried to respond at odd intervals so it doesn’t ever pan out. (Conversation ends early March, no texts to one another) Now, although the situation above has been resolved, I have been deeply affected by it. Before this, I trusted him wholeheartedly. Now, I find myself doubting and wondering if he is actually hanging out with whoever he says he is with (even with telegram short videos) and what he is doing. From the start, He does things to show that he loves me, tells me that, gives me reassurance and what not. We were even planning our future and started saving together (no joint account, just our money in my bank). So for this to happen, you could say I was pretty mind fucked. I couldn’t process it lol because I was so confused. I am not experienced in a relationship and consider him to be my first, so I don’t know if I should continue being with him and rebuild back the trust I had while working on our future together.-#96500: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96500",55,10,0,4,12,18,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

#96494,17/3/2021,"In reply to #96474 (and I hope this gets posted, thanks admin!) Reading your confession stirred my emotions so I'd also like to share my story and take. TL;DR: boyfriend of 3 years dumped me after emotionally and physically cheating on me (with three different girls), and I have since moved on from that douchebag. 25F and 29M. Met in our previous workplace but had no initial feelings for each other as I was attached. Broke up shortly after because of differences (younger guy still in school while I was in the workforce, couldn't meet much, different places and stuff). We got closer about half a year later because of all the opportunities we had to work together, and got together after dating for about 2 months. Everything was good. I met his family, went out with them often (even without my ex) and stuff. Fast forward to 2018, he joined a sales role and basically started to build connections with his teammates, and then started to get close to a few female ones (whom I'll name A B and C). He got close to A, to the point that they'd meet almost every day to do cold-calls and door-knocks together, they'd invite each other to their house to take a shower before heading off to their next destination, he'd drive to her house to pick her up. When confronted, he says that it's normal because he doesn't like to go to his next destination feeling all sweaty and sticky, and his/her house is nearer so they'd head to each other's houses as a pit stop. Quarreled for hours over it, had a cold war and then I decided to let it go (stupid). Next, girl B. Girl B is a friend of ex's close friend (hence friend by extension). Girl B was never really in the picture, but they would hang out from time to time because they're in the same team. And on xmas night, he told me that his team was having a party and he couldn't spend it with me, so ok, we did it in advance. Then, girl B kissed my ex, and they spent the night together. (did not know of this until we broke up) In that same time period, my ex and I both got to know girl C (he introduced me to her when we met up after I finished work nearby). Girl C and him were ""really similar"", and they spent a lot, a lot of time together. Going on roadtrips to malaysia, cooking food for each other (and a few others), having dessert and supper time together all the way until 5am together. He slowly stopped replying me, and I confronted him again about this. He told me to stop overthinking, and started to give me the cold shoulder saying that I was too stressed at work, too paranoid, a pain in the ass, etc. and basically gaslighting me like crazy without me realising it. It took me a lot of courage to take the first step to ask for a break. But when I did, he readily said alright. We took a break for 2 weeks. While I spent almost every night feeling sorry and getting overwhelmed by my emotions, he was probably out frolicking happily. 2 weeks later, he came down to my place and we had a really long talk. He confessed everything, all the lies, about girl B and C. He liked C for a good 3 months by then. He kept justifying himself saying that I'm too overbearing, too clingy, too negative, too much. He then said he no longer feels the same about me. I was pretty lost on what to do at the point, honestly. I went home and broke down, I was a wreck for at least a month. I couldn't eat and sleep, I went to work with puffy eyes, barely conscious. But fast forward to now, I've come out so much stronger than how I was. It really took a lot of effort on my own part. Seeing you in a similar position as how I was, I just want to say: please don't go back to him. Delete him, everything about him. Remove and block him. You won't feel better if he reaches out to you or replies to your messages. You won't feel better seeing him post new photos on social media flaunting how happy his life is. Once the door has shut, it's time to move on. He has someone new and won't spend an ounce of effort trying to even talk to you unless he's lonely. You don't need to stoop so low. Be better than that. There are much more greener pastures for you out there. Keep your head held high. It may take weeks, months, or even years, but someday, you'll look back and realise that he never deserved you.

Some time back, I found out from the third party that my bf was going to meet her to sleep with her and like that in itself was a huge red flag but because it was the first time and he didn't show in the end cuz he said something like he realized he didn't want anyone else, I let it go. But like after that incident, he's been feeling really distant and it hurts? Like we used to hang out everyday and now he just wants to hang out with his friends and he goes out alone to arcades and stuff and tbh every time he does that I get a lil insecure cause that's what he told me that time, that he was going to go out to buy something, before disappearing an entire day... Not sure how to react anymore, this is the third big drama we had in the few months we were tgt (first being that his mom found something in his phone she wasn't supposed to, then second being that his ex contacted me to tell me he was on okc) and like he claimed to be clean and that he didn't text any other girls besides friendly chatter but he gave me access to his tele and I saw him talking about nsfw stuff? Not sure if it matters but the reason he gave me for cheating was that he didn't want to keep guilting me into ""satisfying"" him every time we had a sleep over (which he did regularly before this) and like because I didn't really feel ready to give up my v card just yet. Honestly I just feel really tired right now, and yeah that's what he says when I try to talk to him about it too - that he's tired and doing his best. I don't really want to give up this rs cause beside all this, he had a lot of good points. So I'm kinda just really lost right now, while he goes off and has fun with his friends and whatnot.

Last year, we broke up again and he told me he didn’t love me anymore. after a while, we got back together and everything was fine. i even thought that ever since december last year, everything was perfect. i thought this was our best year yet and we are gonna have a future together. until february 2021, he and his female best friend which i will call A got really close because she broke up with her boyfriend and she was leaning to my bf for support and advices. i know her personally and she is very much in love and loyal to her bf. but they got really close to the point he stayed up till midnight to call with her listening to her cry and complaining even though he have work in the next morning. they even went out for drinks with another friend frequently. they text almost daily and he replies her instantly too. at this point, i got fed up and a lil jealous of their relationship even tho i know they are just friends. so me and him fought about her for a while and took a break. after a day, he msg me and told me that he is tired of our breaks and asked me if we will have a future tgt. then we met up the next day and he told me that he’s tired of our relationship and he felt everything was different since 2019. he told me he wanna break up with me, so i asked him to reconsider as i really love him despite we fight a lot. he then told me to wait until 2nd of april and he will give me an answer. i agreed, but the next day he came to find me after drinking and told me that everything he said the previous night was a joke and said it was a lesson for me to not say break up so easily everytime we fight. i then believed him and we got back together. then 2 days later, we went out for dinner. when we reached my house gate, i told him that i wanna spend more time tgt as it has been a long time since we get some quality time together. he then told me he’s really tired and he really wanna go home. i then complained and fought about him and A’s relationship. he kept quiet the whole time and it was only me who’s shouting. he kept giving me cold replies like ok, i wanna go back, whatever. obviously i got even more angry and heated. at the same time, it was the first day of my period so i was a lil crazy. he then snapped and said he wanna break up for real this time. then only i realise the seriousness of his break up. then we went home, he told me the truth that everything he said 2 days ago was fake and he really wanted a breakup but he felt bad and gave it another try. but after seeing me fighting and shouting at him today, he said he can’t do it anymore. then i wrote a long essay and list to compile the problems we have in the relationship and how to fix them and told him i am very serious about fixing our relationship and changing this time. i also apologised for all the bad behaviour and for that day. then he told me to give him a week to reconsider his decision which is until today. during this week, he followed the girl where he emotionally cheated on me before on instagram, followed few other girls and deleted our pictures on his account. i felt horrible and crushed as i know his answer will still remain the same. today came and we met up. and yes as i expected his answer is still to breakup. reason is that he’s really tired of me and our relationship. he doesn’t wanna be in a relationship or do anything now he just wanna enjoy his life as a single person right now. he also admitted that he had a “hao gan” to his female best friend, A. “hao gan” is like a good impression but not necessarily have feelings. we discussed everything rationally today, there was no fighting or crying just now. so i agreed to his decision to break up today. i am really in despair and i really want him back as i really think we could have a good future. i am thinking of starting a no contact rule to get him back. is he gonna come back after i change into a more positive person? after being together for so long, it must be hard to get over someone. has anyone ever tried no contact with their ex bf and eventually their ex bf really came back? how long does it actually take? what advices do you have for me, please don’t just ask me to move on as i know i should and will be trying to while on no contact rule. thank you for reading until here. i really need some advices here!-#96474: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96474",84,18,0,13,12,39,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#96472,17/3/2021,"To #96417, been there in your place. I used to think that getting a girl friend would be awesome. It can be, but it also has a lot of cons. You would realize them later because you would find the perfect girl but you might still be unhappy.I had also not properly kissed a girl till I had graduated. And yes, kisses are great, especially when you are asked to close your eyes, you really dunno what to expect and you get the first kiss. But having a girlfriend is very troublesome too.Eventually, you would want to live together. Cuddling is great for a few minutes but it gets really sweaty and uncomfortable after a few mins. Your girlfriend might not like that you like to play games. You have to be considerate and turn off the lights when she wants to sleep at night. She would like to have meals with you and maybe you like your meals with Netflix.I know you would think these are small cons, and you will not believe me that the above is more annoying than sleeping alone. Therefore, let me tell you this. You will be having many relationships. Keep swiping. Use all of Tinder, Bumble, happn, OkC & CMB and when you go running, swipe in between. Use your super likes etc. You will eventually match, you will go on dates, you will have a lot of sex, but at the end, you will realise it is a waste of time. The experiences are great, but the thrill does not match what you would experience if you built something or raised funding for your startup or received great reviews from a customer.You are beautiful. I was overweight, young (3 years younger than girls in my batch), from India (did not know many good bars or places to go) and did not have a good dressing sense. I was so noob that I literally asked permission to kiss and kisses are not great when the other person is laughing. You will have great relationships and then you will realise that what you wanted to do all along was be Elon Musk. Then you will set out on your real dream and change the world.-#96472: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96472",8,5,0,0,21,31,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
#96471,17/3/2021,"I share the same sentiments as post #96362 (no job, no home, no spouse, no kid, aimless). Perhaps it all started from being jobless and work defines so much of a person, there’ll be lots of negative thoughts going through your mind, can’t sleep at night, it affects your self worth, your identity and all other aspects of your life, including the confidence to build relationships with people, your finances, and it is easy for things to go downward spiraling. One bad thought leads to another, it’s easy to then make bad decisions which leads to more bad choices.For me, I had to let my new found job go as they were pushing me to work on a case which I had a conflict of interest (could get sued). Looking back, I don’t think I made the wrong choice, it was my integrity at stake. But in the midst of a recession, all of a sudden, the career which I’ve taken steps to build up is gone. It’s also easy to say look for a job, have been trying for 4 months already. Similar to other jobseekers, sent many CVs (tailored to each role) everyday, went for some interviews, nothing so far, perhaps the whole industry talks and all the recruiters have seen my CV. Part time job – yes doing it now but not long term, the contract will end soon. Courses – yes also went for 3 different certifications learn new things but everyone is also upskilling. Savings – have been trying to scrimp and save also. Reached out to my network, after a while people also wonder – eh why this person still can’t get a job, is there something wrong? That’s probably when you wish to run away and hide in a hole, demoralized, beat yourself up over a past decision made, or wish you have a SO to talk to, or a kid to fuss over, instead of posting on an anonymous platform like this, haha. Sometimes I feel that too. Maybe the stress in Singapore is really too much. The only thing that keeps me going is to carry on because I am my strongest advocate.  If even I give up on myself, no one will help me already. And since we are on this topic, if anyone has any permanent roles to recommend / career tips to share, please do let me know also ya.

#96470,17/3/2021,"I honestly dont know. What did i do that was so wrong that i had to be subjected to such ridicule and harasssment. All i did was just confessing to a guy that i really liked, and it took me a lot of courage to do so. He was single too, so there were no issues. I used to have a pretty good relation with the person i liked. We talked a lot as friends and shared a lot of laughters. Just that he was a popular guy, that is all. Is it because im slightly overweight and not pretty at all? I dont match up to him? That u people had to overly tease him to the extend that i didnt even get any replies from that said confession and we dont talk anymore. Making fun of me, photoshopping pictures of me and sending it around. Do u people think its funny? Even though it happened a few years ago, i have become afraid. Just thinking back on all these memories still makes me cry.  I have become too afraid to take the first step in forming a relationship with someone. Now i have another person i like, but i am too afraid to let my feelings be known so that we can just stay as friends. As the dumb person i am, i maintain a certain distance from the person i like and say things that i dont mean. I dont know what to do, i know i need help to get over the past.

I think my introversion has already been causing some issues. When I spend time with people, just anybody in general even with family and my closest friends, my energy and enthusiasm gets drained super fast. I can be enthusiastic and talk normally for the first couple of hours, but then my energy gets drained quickly and I’ll need to be alone for a long time to recharge. I went for a few dates with my bf and showed this behavior as well. He thought that I was depressed or he did smth wrong and doesn’t seem to get it even though I explained my condition. He is an introvert as well but his condition is not as serious as mine and he can spend time with people normally for hours. Also, I have to keep thinking of interesting and appropriate replies and topics when talking to him in person and texting, which tbh is an additional effort on top of other things I have in life such as studies and cca. I know it’s just the way I am and totally not his fault. I can’t imagine life if I were to get married and have to eat, breathe and sleep with someone 24/7 and idk if it’ll drive me crazy.

#96465,17/3/2021,"I’ve been in love with a girl for more than 5 years now. Have you ever been so in love with someone that you don’t want to have a relationship with anyone else, even if it means you will be single for the rest of your life? That’s how I feel about her.In the past 5 years, she has been in 2 relationships that ended badly. It was heartbreaking for me to see her put on a strong front, even though I knew she was dying inside. In those moments where I could sense how much anguish she was hiding underneath, all I wanted to do is to be a shoulder for her to lean on. I’ve been told that the purest form of love is when you just want her to be happy, and that’s the only thing I have ever wanted for her.I’m just an acquaintance. But I’m good friends with one of her best friends, through whom I have always asked about her (casually). As long as I have known her, she has been with someone. Even though I couldn’t bear seeing her with someone else, she appeared to be happy, and that was enough for me. She was always happy until she suddenly isn’t.She is pushing 30 now, and has now decided to take a step back from relationships and to focus on her career. She is happy again now, and I’m happy for her.My feelings for her has never changed since the moment I fell for her 5 years ago. I want to marry her and no one else. I want to be everything for her.As I have never dated anyone before, I am terrified and I don’t know how to approach her.

I feel like after 5 years and even paying down payment for BTO together, he got quite complacent in our relationship and takes advantage of the fact that I will always be here. This thought came to me because in the past year, I feel like he rather spend more time with his friends than me. We are both in our final year in uni now and are super busy with our own courses, so we don’t spend a lot of time together let alone, see each other (maybe only 3 times a month). But when we do have free time, he’s always hanging out with his friends who he sees everyday in school and he never invites me to join his friends, and I’m not the kind who like to be like “bojio” because I don’t want to impose on people if they don’t want me there fully. And even if we set aside a day to spend time with each other (can be one day in two weeks kind of frequency), he doesn’t treasure the time I set aside for him within my busy schedule as he tends to cut our time together short to go hang out with the same bunch of friends afterwards. And you would think for someone in his final year and spending so much time with friends, he might be doing work with them. Nope. They really just hang out for fun like drinking until morning kind. Also, he can even go the extra mile for any of them like go over to one of their houses late at night for something as simple as talking to them when they are feeling down, but he never does this kind of thing for me? When the same thing happens to me and I text him that I‘m feeling down, he just tell me to sleep it off, tell me he love me and then say he got a busy day tomorrow goodnight, meanwhile his friends get special treatment? He used to also go the extra mile for me during honey moon phase but that faded away after awhile and I guess it got transferred over to his friends. It’s making me insecure because he’s not making effort in showing me he still loves me other than just saying it and actions really does speak a lot louder than words. It doesn’t help that his friend group is mixed guys and girls as it adds this extra layer of insecurity that he might just be more interested in one of the girls. He didn’t even remember my birthday. Breaking up with him over this also feels stupid because we’ve been together for so long and I don’t know if this is just a passing phase, and now there’s the additional burden of the BTO down payment that will go down to waste. So yeah, I will definitely talk to him again and hope that he will actually listen, but I just wanted to know what are the general opinions about this first and whether anyone has overcome this kind of problem in their own relationship?-#96454: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96454",60,16,0,32,0,55,0,17,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

Many times after our breakup she would often give me false hope and mix signals. She do know that I still have feelings for her even till now. She was on dating apps (ss of her account was sent to me by a anonymous person definitely not catfish because the pics used are not found on her social media) not sure if she even dated anyone while giving me false hopes.

#96440,17/3/2021,"Hi everyone, sorry for the rant ahead but I really need some advice and perspective I am currently living with my parents just like many single 20s out there. But my mother is really controlling over every single aspect of my life - from the time I wake up to the time I sleep, from the time I do my school work to what I eat everyday. It’s just this imposing authoritarian presence that I am so stifled in my identity, potential and lifestyle. If I am out and about, when I get home, I have to go through this long questioning about what I eat, what I do ... basically every single detail of my life. And it’s honestly damn tiring. I get that she care about me but there is totally no personal space and boundary to the point that it takes an emotional and mental toll on me. Recently, I watched John’s video on Zula and realised how common this is (from the comment section)https://youtu.be/PtALB_dQGR8Aside from that, my mother has this gender bias whereby the girl (in this case, me) has to do all the saikang/shit job. I have to do all the chores around the house while my elder brother relaxes on the sofa watching tv and playing mobile games. She doesn’t give me a specific list of chores to do. Instead, I am at her every call and demand. So every time she calls me to come and do xyz, I have to go and get it done immediately. When I finally sit down to watch a video or eat, she then ask me to get up to bring her a drink etc. It’s so frustrating - I feel like I am her slave or maid instead of her daughter. I am no financial position to move out on my own or to my relatives (the adults fell out with each other and I am not close to them).

We have expressed interest in each other and have been continuing to getting to each other. But recently he became too stressed up with his school (assignments, exam) and started to communicate less. I can see he is stress (usually he is like that). And he said, he wanted to take a space from me to reevaluate what he wants and he will get back to me (we 'departed') in a nice manner. But idk, if he will be back and idk if i should wait. So guys, truly what to know what does it mean when a guy say he wants his space?-#96433: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96433",20,2,0,3,0,11,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
#96430,17/3/2021,"I am in a long distance relationship with a guy on the other side of the planet. Due to the pandemic, it's been hard on the both of us as we can't be there for each other physically if something happens. We have been together for 6 months and it's been a little rocky... I'd like to get some advice from you guys on my situation...I think I'm quite low maintenance and I'm not materialistic at all. I like hearing words of affirmation and spending quality time with my loved ones. He is also quite similar. I'm in my early 20s and he's in the high 20s so there is a 8 year age gap between us. Since we can't be with each other physically, we hang out in the call for long hours and we would play games sometimes. He loves playing OSRS so I'd try playing a little and I would watch him as he screen shares his game. Whenever one of us needs to wake up at a certain time we would wake each other up instead of the usual alarm. We would eat and watch shows together too.The relationship overall has been rough and we almost broke off a number of times as he is a little insecure that I'm not there physically with him.. He's worried that I would leave him for someone else (which I would deny every time). He tried breaking things off with me as he says he ""isn't rich"" and wants me to leave so he doesn't have to. He's also worried that he would be making a mistake being with me because what if it doesn't work out? He'd be wasting time. He thinks he's old and I'm too young and he'd be robbing me of my freedom. In one of our ""fights"", he said ""you're going to screw over my life""/""if you're not going to screw me over now you'll do it later"". What I don't get is why did he say all that when he says he's afraid of losing and hurting me? Why does he push me away sometimes? I felt so used and neglected whenever he hung up on me. He has his depressive bouts and would always give me short replies and ignores me for a while. He did tell me once that he wants to die but he's just afraid to do it. It makes me worried because what if something happened? Is he going to leave me again?He's a sweet and thoughtful guy and he makes me feel so loved and cared for even though he's so far away. I try to make him feel the same way but I don't know how. I tried directly asking him but he says I don't have to and that I'm already perfect to him. He would always try to help me in any way he could and if I needed a little money for lunch or dinner he wouldn't hesitate and just told me to get whatever I want. I wanted to get a pc recently and he helped me out a lot which I really appreciate.I tried to make plans in March to head over but it's crazy expensive. Flights are at least 1K and I have to account for the days I have to self-isolate here and there. Not to mention it costs 2K to isolate when I get back now... I am still studying and he is working, but it has been hard on him as his work has been on and off. I feel like our relationship is always revolving around a mountain of ""what-if""s. I have a heap of questions and no one to get advice from... How do you keep the relationship alive despite the long distance? How do you assure someone who's insecure? How do you cope in the relationship if the other party is insecure? What can you do if you're the younger party in the relationship?

#96427,17/3/2021,"Dear  #96391,I'm a 25 year old male who previously thought that I'm gay. I have only ever had sex with guys and I find myself sexually attracted to girls as well. However, I don't see myself being romantically involved with girls though. In fact, I'm in a relationship with a gay guy for a long time now. I personally believe that sexuality does not boil down to labels. I do think labels came up because it was a matter of convenience though, like it's easier to tell someone you're straight/gay because then the other person would know. But personally, I see it more as a spectrum. For example, perhaps being 100% gay can be represented as the color blue, and being 100% straight is red. Along the spectrum, there will be many shades of purple, right? Some of them will be a red-based purple, and some of them can be blue-based purple. But they're all still purple! So my advice would be to embrace your sexuality, don't let labels restrict you. The only label I believe in is my own identity. And for me, it took a long time for me to be comfortable with my sexuality and have it be a part of my identity, and that's okay. We all are on our own journey!

#96420,17/3/2021,"[Ask Prof Ben] I graduated from NUS a few years back on a civil service scholarship and am now serving my bond with the govt. As my bond is nearing its end, I am thinking of leaving to do a PhD in the same field as my undergrad studies, which is something I would have done back then if not for the bond. But I'm unsure of making the jump now for the following reasons:1) Age. As someone nearing 30 and probably starting a family soon, I'm not sure if leaving the comfort of a civil service job to be a grad student is a wise choice at this point. 2) I've also left schools for a good 5 years, and my knowledge in the field is very rusty. Not sure if I'm able to still cope with the academic rigours of grad school. 3) Risk. There's the risk of not being able to secure a job after a PhD. There's also the risk that I don't quite enjoy PhD as much as I thought. Would like to hear Prof Ben's thoughts and advice as someone who has gone through a similar path?

To start off with, the lecture was not conducted well, and there were times when the lecturer just read off his slides. In fact, when a student asked him to clarify on a particular slide, he read the slide again and did not answer the question. By looking at the file information of the slides that the lecturer gave us, the author of the file was not even him, but another prof who used to teach the module. The first part of the project for CS3243 talks about an abstract problem that has not appeared much in literature. Suspiciously, a project on the UROPs/FYPs list matched word-for-word with our project statement, and even under the professor himself. Doesn't it seem like he is mining for ideas from the students of CS3243, ultimately presenting the ""best"" algorithm as his own research? There was no consent given by the students, but there is nothing stopping him from passing on the work of students as his own work.Additionally, for the second part of the project, he has repeatedly pushed back the start date of the project such that it is two weeks behind schedule (week 9 to week 10 Friday), which eats into our revision time since there is a Final Quiz for the module in week 13. The prof also unreasonably expects us to use our reading week to work on the project when we have other exams to study for during reading week as well! Does the university not regulate reading week such that students can focus on their exams, instead of having assignments due then?I feel that there are unreasonable demands made in this module that need to be addressed.

So i applied for suss part time and got shortlisted for an interview however, after the interview and weeks of waiting no news and then when i went to check my application status on their website. Its stated that i did not have an application with them? So whats the meaning of this? I paid for an application only to get it removed without any updates? Also the interview process was seriously biased. My interview zoom room had 9 guys and i was the only girl. I was the last to be interviewed(name wise) and the interviewer spent a good half of the interview time talking to me about what i should do when i got rejected, he only asked me 2 questions like introduce myself and why i wanted to join this course. I doubt any interviewer will talk to u about getting rejected for half the time if they didnt even already not want to accept you. The interviewer also pointed out my age and mentioned that i was young n had alot of time? Like what has this got to do with anything. So what if people applying are older? I chose to apply when im younger becauze i clearly couldnt afford a full time uni fee and thats y needed to take part time uni while holding a job. Also my course is an IT related course so i can understand why its pretty male dominated but i feel as it they just threw me under the bus.

Recently, a few guys have expressed their interests in me. They have been really sweet to me, planning the hangouts based on what i wanna do and prioritise me a lot but i’ve rejected all of them because of these “excuses”1. I don’t like them back romantically 2. Would rather prioritise time on studies/ work instead of relationships3.  i’m the date to marry  person so expectations kinda highI’ve been really happy being single until i met this guy who seems really sweet and super caring and definitely my type. He says he really likes talking to me but he has his dreams to chase and ya da ya da yada basically giving me excuses that i kinda gave to the other guys To summarise, im not interested in the people who are interested in me but the people I’m interested in are not interested in meNow the real question is, is this karma or am i just delusional. It’s not my fault that I don’t like the other guys though i really appreciate the things they’ve done for me and enjoy talking to them. However i still can’t find it in me to reciprocate back the feelings. I dont blame the guy that i like for chasing his dreams but it does make me think twice before i reject someone next time because i will always be thinking that this is gonna bite me back in the future as the person i like is not gonna like me back.This gives me a little stress because what if i reject all the guys and i regret it in the future because im waiting on someone who doesn’t even like me back and it’s a never ending cycle-#96345: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96345",24,4,0,3,8,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

""My phone rings off the hook cos I've got doctors calling me to ask me about drug dosing, drug interactions, side effects and so on."" Wow, I didn't realise we are still living in the pre-Internet era where pharmacists are the only source of such information for doctors. The profession is full of seniors like you who get all proud and smug about being helping doctors who are too lazy to go look at Lexicomp (FYI doctors are also able to access and understand Lexicomp/UpToDate, they usually just want to blame someone if things go sideways). Hence, we are the underpaid and under-recognised profession because that is all we are known for - the people who save doctors that 5 minutes of looking at Lexicomp/UpToDate. Hope those ""thanks for the panadol dose"" words that give you a warm fuzzy feeling, helps to pay for the ever increasing cost of living in Singapore. ""Been there, done that""The profession is full of seniors like you who gratefully accept the doctors' abuse and tell everyone ""Oh it is okay, been there done that, so you all should endure the same abuse as me, rite of passage yknow"". Hence, we are forever abused by doctors. Why don't you answer these questions - why are doctors less likely to give up their license compared to pharmacists or why do our pharmacy professors send their kids to med school - before you come back with some ""inspiring"" story about how you saved the world by advising the doctor about the correct dose of lactulose. Maybe it got something to do with pay and recognition which is not available for pharmacists because seniors like you are contented being underpaid and abused.-#96346: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96346",4,1,0,0,0,17,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
#96349,17/3/2021,"To those boasting about how irreplaceable they are in the IT sector, let me remind you that the reality may be more daunting than you expect. Ask yourself, what really makes you stand out from the crowd, what makes you think that you cannot be outsourced? One prominent figure here mentioned it’s because “modern systems are complex”. Do you think highly intelligent Indian developers cannot handle complex systems? These guys who migrate are insanely proficient (given many of them begin coding as kids with a specific goal in mind), infinitely more driven than your average local Joe and can speak better English than most of you. In a country like Singapore which prides itself on prostituting its workers to foreign companies, the lower price always has the advantage and in this case, the quality remains uncompromised too. The legal and healthcare sectors and somewhat protected by regulatory and licensing bodies, but who’s protecting the software developers? I believe it’s just a matter of time before companies start to take advantage of this and salaries get undercut. Maybe the only one safe right now is the military – no one would dare to outsource those guys.-#96349: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96349",15,2,0,0,7,24,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It used to be pretty healthy(on the bed) with my exes but for my current bf, I'm having some problem. Both of us have low s*x drive and both are equally clueless.

#96302,17/3/2021,"tldr: if parents weren't married, father would most likely be guilty of at least sexual harassment and stalking. what can i do?Hi everyone, my parents are in a very weird dynamic now and would like to ask for help on anything I can do to help? Basically here's the brief run down on what's happening:- there is no love in the marriage, they were basically ""forced"" to marry despite not liking each other (sometimes i wonder how i even exist, i strongly suspect it's a very dark reason (readers fill in the blank yourself))- father suspects mother has affair (which i believe doesn't exist), and so has recently been getting very crazy, reading through every message/phone call in my mother's phone (he managed to guess my mother's password), scrutinizing all of her schedule and work documents secretly. also he's been stalking my mother by going to a food court near my mother's workplace and spying on her, to track her movements and the people she's with (although i think he's stopped now). - father is also a dirty pervert. once caught him masturbating behind my mother while touching her shoulder. also i saw him sniffing mother's panties hanging in the toilet (he doesn't know i saw). mother doesn't know all this other than being touched unwillingly. - father keeps telling me he wants to kill the guy he suspects is chasing mother, also father has said he wants to harm mother's family (they fell out)- mother has been trying to divorce father multiple times, but father keeps refusing.- basically i'm also trying to help mother divorce father because father is just a complete asshole, but looking at sg divorce law, i'm surprised the criteria for divorce is so strict? i don't know which line my parents satisfy, no one has committed adultery, no one has deserted anyone, we are still living together, and no one has been physically violent or anything. at most we satisfy the ""cannot be reasonably expected to live with defendant"" part, but that sounds so vague and open to interpretation, not sure if we satisfy that.- also a bit worried divorce will be rejected because father is quite old now, he has no savings, won't be able to work for much longer, and basically can't live independently cos he doesn't know how to pay his bills and stuff. can the court reject divorce on the grounds of ensuring a vulnerable old person like the father has someone to take care of him?

#96300,17/3/2021,"I've just recently come to the startling realisation that I (22M) still have no idea how to make friends? I don't think it's about being harder to make friends in uni, even in secondary school and JC, I think I never actually progressed with anyone beyond an acquaintanceship. It's like in school, you just talk random crap to the people sitting around you, discuss school work, and at the end of the day, you go home and no one cares about you or texts you except to ask for help on homework. Meanwhile, I see almost everyone else hanging out outside of school, be it to go shopping, watch movie, play sports, etc., but no one has actually asked me to hang out before? So far now I have pinpointed a few possible reasons why no one seems to want to be my friend:1. I have nothing to talk about. I don't follow mainstream media (movies, dramas, music). I don't play the games everyone is playing (e.g. Maple, Dota, LoL). I have no knowledge about any pop culture stuff (e.g. Harry Potter, LoTR, Star Wars, Disney, whatever show is on Netflix, ...). I simply have no interest and do not really like all this stuff. If I force myself to get into these stuff, I feel like I would be just ""mugging"" pop culture and that just sounds totally incredulous to me. I do have hobbies though, I am really passionate about more extreme music like black/death metal, and I learnt to play bass because of this music, but whenever I talk about this people just look at me like some weirdo (especially Christians lol), or just brush me off and never talk about it again. I also like to play computer games, but I usually play games that are 10-20 years old because that's all my computer can run (e.g. I just completed my 5th play through of GTA SA), and also don't really like multiplayer games because they give me more anxiety than fun. On a related note, I don't know how to start a conversation. I googled some conversation starters but almost all of them sound so cringy to me, like I literally don't give a shit what you did during the weekend, or what book you read recently. I feel very uncomfortable asking such textbook conversation openers because then I would be insincere and being fake and I hate being fake. 2. I don't make a lot of eye contact. I heard it's supposed to be a very natural thing, but I am personally super intimidated by it, I will instinctively avoid people's eye contact in less than 1 second, and if I force myself to maintain eye contact, I will literally shudder in anxiety after 2-3 seconds. Am I giving off bad vibes by not making eye contact? Is this how people judge whether you want to be their friend? I really have no idea since I don't look at people's face anyway but that doesn't mean I don't want to be their friend. 3. I am not physically attractive. Sometimes I think that there is something about my appearance (although I don't know what) that puts people off? E.g. there have been multiple times, where I was taking the bus, and the whole bus is packed except for the last empty seat beside me, and yet no one wants to sit beside me to clear up more space? Also when meeting new people in uni, I can literally see the fear on their faces when I am talking to them. Anyways I still have tons of questions about making friends. How does friendship develop? Do people look at somebody, think ""I want to be this person's friend"", and then try some tricks to make that person your friend? Or are friends usually made by people just naturally gravitating together? Is there some secret trick that people do to make friends that I am just wholly unaware about? Must you have common interests with someone to be the person's friend? Anyways, I also want to be able to practice making friends, but I have no idea how to. I am a bit averse to practicing in real-life situations by trying to go out and join communities, because I'm scared half of Singapore will end up knowing me as the creepy awkward guy. In conclusion, I would really appreciate some answers and advice from anyone. I still want to get married and have kids and stuff, but how am I supposed to get a girlfriend if I don't even know how to make a friend? Thanks. (PS I know some of the questions I ask can be easily googled, but I am aware that a lot of stuff on google are written in from a Western/American perspective which may not be transferable to Singapore, so I am hoping to just get some more locally relevant answers.)-#96300: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96300",8,3,0,3,0,8,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I literally grew up with this person on my side all the time but he was just like ur ex - he felt that there was no way he was going to convince my parents. He told me directly, "" if you want to get married to me, find a way to leave your house."" When my parents first found out about us, they went mad. They said no way and that i will suffer if i marry him. But i was adamant. I was determined that this was not going to change my decision and didn't speak to my family members. We constantly fought each time they found out i was out him.In the beginning, i tried to ignore the bigger problem. I told myself that when the time is right everything will fall in place. But it does not.Like your ex, he had issues with his  job, he was not responsible and it was me who started earning a steady income while he was busy job hopping n clubbing. I didnt mind paying for everything because i loved him. But reality hit me. My friends who were together for 2-3 years had plans to BTO, they were planning their lives ahead.  But i was still handling this person and helping him steady his life. He made it look like we weren't planning anything 'cos my parents didnt approve.'Worse, he wouldn't want to talk to my parents or get his parents over to mitigate the issue. I often asked him about just making things formal so that it wouldn't be that awkward for us in future. But he said nope. He said his ego was much bigger and no way he 'was going to step into my parent's home'.Long story short, i decided one day to end the relationship based ENTIRELY on his decision not to come over n speak to my parents. It said a lot about how much he was willing to show he loved me.I was not asking for money or vacations or expensive rings. Just to be on my side to tell my parents together that we got it all settled and to assure them. But he said no.This was not about my parents, but it was about me. About us. It also hit me that he was not confident because my parents were not wrong about his behaviour and irresponsibility. It took me a long time to get over the decade. But trust me, looking back, i am so glad i didnt choose to stay with someone who valued his ego over our relationship.  It hurt like mad, but time definitely heals. PLEASE BELIEVE THAT LIFE MOVES ON.

The problem is we have been good friends for many years (to the extent that our whole group of friends often visit each other's homes for gatherings, our +1s are aware of all our existence). And in all those years, we've never felt this spark til recently when our conversations started getting deeper.This attraction/spark/passion has really been burning strong... we both feel it... and I'm thinking maybe it's because it's forbidden? But yet it's not just this passion either because there's also the emotional connection, and the depth of conversation is unparalleled. We've been really good friends for years and so we've been quite open and honest about it - but the extent of this feeling is pretty crazy.

To the point where we're both so tired trying to do the right thing, that it became clear that maybe friendship has to be put on hold at least for now, and we've agreed to stop talking and meeting at least for the time being, til we're ready to be friends again, and we've been going out of our ways to avoid each other at social gatherings.

#96276,17/3/2021,"Hi everyone, I need some advice please. The context is that I am an undergrad with a girlfriend who works full time. We have already BTO-ed and plan to get married in 3 years.There’s been much stress in planning a wedding, as we are having an inter race marriage, and as such, have to accomodate to various customs. Regardless, that is something we have to go through anyway, so no complaints. It’s a rite of passage. The problem is that I feel as though I am simply getting too tired, not taking care of myself. I feel that every moment of my life is spent taking care of her and her needs, as she struggles with many problems. I’ve been her rock, and yet I feel like I am cracking. I am constantly listening to the rants and complaints, and it never ends. I find it difficult to deal with the fact that I seem to be an emotional dumpster, struggling with the baggage while people carry on with their lives. However, how can I stop, when I’m the only one she has who understands?This becomes much worse when I am accused of not initiating dates for her to be pampered and such, showing her how much I love her. While there might be some truth in the sense that I haven’t been doing much, I do have a valid reason, that I’ve simply been spending too much. I have explained time and time again that I’m doing my best to save for our future, but it appears to fall on deaf ears. Most of my money is being spent on taking her out to lunch and dinner to places she’s craving for. I am constantly burning through my wallet for her sake. Yet, it never seems to be enough, as there’s always something she feels “I can do better”. The clincher, is that I don’t get treated the way she demands to be treated, which does cause a bitter taste in my mouth. I have attempted to communicate this discrepancy, to disastrous results as she starts to be self-loathing, bemoaning her other responsibilities.I want this to work out for the best, but I think some can relate with the sense of hopelessness I feel now.

Sorry if I offend anyone, but some questions I've been wondering about - 1. Are girls usually able to have orgasms during sex i.e. penetration? If not, what ways can they?? And how many times can they go in a day? I've heard friends complain about how it was bad with their ex but good with their current, so what exactly is considered good skills like the comments say????2. On average, how many rounds can a guy go in a day normally? 3. How frequently do people actually have sex??4. Is sexual intimacy / compatibility really that important if everything else is great? Now I'm genuinely worried for when I get married, what if its really bad??? Or what if one wants it more often than the other? 5. Does passion / sexual tension / wtv its called actually last? For people in LT relationships or who are married. Won't it die down or get boring after awhile? 6. People always talk about guys' skills, but I've never heard people talk about girls' skills... so how exactly can a girl be good at sex?? I apologize if I offend anyone, but pleaseee HELP a poor soul out. I'm very open minded, and so are my friends, but for some reason my friends (both guys and girls) think it's the funniest thing on earth when I ask them, they literally collapse in laughter and I just can't get a straight answer -#96273: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96273",9,2,0,3,3,13,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

It hasn't been great for me in the dating scene. usually when I bring this up inevitably after some dates (usually quite early on, no point wasting people's time right since this is such a major thing) I can visibly tell that the other person is taken aback and the response is either1. ""you hate kids? but they're so cute!"" (i don't hate kids. also cuteness is not why you should be having them ffs)2.

#96269,17/3/2021,"Should girls serve army?As Singapore advances (albeit slowly) towards a more inclusive society, gender equality has been frequently brought into the limelight. In Singapore, other than equal job opportunities and job prospects, the idea of females serving national service has been suggested many times as well. After all, it does seem fair that in our pursuit of gender equality, females should have their lives held back 2 years as well right? Or well, so it seems…Before I voice my opinion on this matter, I would like to state that I am a guy providing a male perspective on this issue. If this already triggers you or if you plan to invalidate the things I say further on because of this, please scroll pass this post.In my opinion, girls should NOT be mandated to serve army, and never should. Providing alternatives like ""they can serve as nurses what"" is just a desperate attempt to fulfil your emotional revenge on them, that since you wasted 2 years of your life, everyone should too. This should not be the case. Males were conscripted into army for the sole reason for national defense, and if girls are not able to fulfil that role as well as men do (for obvious biological differences), why are we trying to argue for females to go into national service? Nursing is a noble and honorable profession which requires years of clinical experience and exposure, and I do not think that a constant disposable supply of nurses will help the healthcare scene at all. ""Then ask the girls to do basic first aid la!"" - Please la use your brain do you really think there is any VALUE in mandating girls to spend 2 years of their life to do basic first aid? You think Singapore is a warzone in need of constant first aid that requires our WHOLE female population to be held back 2 years to treat your cuts and burns? Compare this to army, where it is a unique scenario where quantity does inherently triumph over quality, and in Singapore's quest to create a strong deterrence force, we need a constant supply of people to rake up our defense numbers. After all, we are a tiny red dot and what we need for intimidation is our defense numbers and state of the art defense equipment. Of course, quality in leadership is needed in army, but you also need a fair share of gundus to chiongsua during war, hence explaining our need for mandatory national service. There is inherent VALUE in guys serving national service to act as a deterrence force for our nation, while there is little to no VALUE in girls using 2 years of their life to learn a skill that can be learnt in a few hours.Well then, what is the solution to this whole saga? Frankly, there is none. Hear me out, the only solution to this scenario is appreciation for each other. Nothing triggers a guy more than when a girl says ""aiya 2 years v fast one la stop complaining"", or ""we need to get pregnant also what"" Let me just address the pregnancy argument really quickly. If this is your stance, does this mean that every female who has hit menopause and is nulliparous must serve the army immediately? What about young girls who cant or do not want to get pregnant? Throw them into army as a ""punishment""?Do you guys see the problem now? There are entitled males who feel that ""since we wasted 2 years of my life, so should you"", and there are also entitled females who feel that ""we are already disadvantaged in society, your 2 years is nothing compared to us"". What we need instead is appreciation for each other. Dear girls, while it is true that army is something that a guy should do, a simple ""I know it sucks but thank you"" is so much better than ""aiya just suck it up la 2 years only"". Correct me if im wrong girls, but if you're pregnant, wouldn’t the best thing to hear from your husband be that he is appreciative for everything you're going through for him and the family? I'm pretty sure you would not want to be hearing things like ""eh my mother say she wants 3 kids leh when are we having our 3rd one ah?"" while you're pregnant right?Appreciation goes a long way in this world, and in this context of army conscription, it is needed more than ever. And to the girls who wish to serve the nation as well, I'm sure MINDEF will welcome you with open arms.

#96264,17/3/2021,"tldr; why are girls (and guys as well) so obsessed with how much a partner is earning?I graduated over a year ago and was fortunate enough to land a job in the finance industry (not FA) earning well above the median and most of my peers and thankful I enjoy what I'm doing. Being single, I decided to download dating apps with the hope of meeting like-minded girls for something serious.I matched this girl who is currently interning and already secured a job elsewhere by the time she graduates in May this year. The conversation started off weird as we were talking about interests and hobbies and all she mentioned was how much she enjoyed working out, going to the gym, lifting, and her experiences being in rowing or dragon boat, as though it was a personality trait. She told me she was maintain a strict workout and diet regime in order to hit xx weight and break her pr (??). Since when did exercising become an identity?!Then the conversation steered towards income and salary, and she mentioned how she secured a high paying job in the tech industry while not majoring in CS/tech related. Saying that she would never have accepted any less than xx amount and all her friends are struggling to find jobs. Then she said that guys must earn more than her, be able to pick her up in their own cars bring her to fancy cafes and restaurants etc. WTF?!Is this what the dating scene looks like in 2021? Where everyone wants to compete and find who can earn the most? My parents are still working and have raised me while being hawkers all their life, and after knowing how much they earned, I was upset for them as the long work hours and tough conditions do not justify the low income. But they are very much happy and contented with life despite the tough working conditions.

#96263,17/3/2021,"Have y’all heard of a NS love story? And I’m not referring to Pioneer’s family-friendly February cover story. I’m talking about two males finding love in NS, learning what it means to grow together under adversity while navigating the treacherous straits of growing attraction.August 2020, I was posted to my current Battalion. As a “newly-minted” specialist, I was at the impressionable stage – looking for role models and taking my cue from them. Motivationally, I was trying to fit into my unit yet I wanted the dignitas accorded to a leader. It was during this stage that I noticed two powerful personalities whose job scopes involved working extensively with all the stakeholders in my Battalion. This gave me many opportunities to observe their interactions and learn about what others in the Battalion think about them.Chiefly, what drew me was the level of respect that they commanded and I’m not just referring to their section. I’m talking about the regulars, the OCs, the CSMs even the RSM and the CO. When they speak, everyone treats them with a lot of respect, displaying an unprecedented level of appreciation. Never before have I seen NSFs so highly esteemed by regulars and never before have I seen anyone (regulars or NSFs) enjoy such high levels of popularity amongst the NSF population. There was an aura of awe and mystery surrounding this pair and the next 8 months of my NS life was spent unravelling the threads of this story.But before I go further, a bit more about myself. My pro term was spent in Stagmont – Home of Signals and at the end of pro term, I thought that would be the last I would see of Stagmont, at least until ORD. Lo and behold, after donning the chevrons, I was posted to my current unit, literally fed to the wolves (iykyk) and I was dreading the thought of spending the rest of my NS life on repetitive manning. Thankfully, for reasons not relevant to this story, I was not made to live that life. Of relevance is that courtesy of this fact, I got a front-row seat to the exploits of this pair. (and now back to the story)Right from the start, this pair was already a cut above the rest. I learnt that they enlisted into the same BMT company, they went to SCS together, they went through SCS together, they were posted to the same vocation, they were posted to the same unit, they even ORD-ed together. It was as if the Army itself conspired to bring them together. And what’s even more incredible, both of them did exceptionally well in Command School – they finished in the top 1% and top 10% of their cohort. And when I say the Army deliberately brought them together, I say this because it is unheard of for the golden and silver bayo (of the same formation!) to be posted to the same unit, especially since that unit only had 2 openings in the same platoon! (From a policy/planning perspective, it will only make sense to ensure an even distribution of top cadets so that more units can benefit, as opposed to sending the elite few to a single unit.)In hindsight, this decision to send both of them to the same unit paid off though, for reasons which I will now explain.This pair was very effective together. They were clearly subject matter experts and they segregated their roles such that broadly speaking, one of them was more concerned with the policy/planning side of things while the other one of them was more on the ground, involved with the implementation side of things. Using this structure, they set to overhauling the logistics management system for the Battalion, implementing more stringent and robust SOPs to ensure accountability. Spanning over a year, it was their display of professionalism and dedication to their tasks that won over the rest of the Battalion. A refrain commonly heard was, “[A] and [B] have truly done a lot for the Battalion since their arrival” along with “y’all really work very hard for the Battalion”. Perhaps what the regulars really valued was the fact that these two NSFs went over and beyond the call of duty, voluntarily taking on roles and work that would’ve been assigned to regulars and thus lightened the regulars’ workload.But maybe, the reason why this pair was able to do so much was because they loved spending time together. Where others would strengthen their bond going on dates and asking each other out to go on dates, this pair invested their time working closely together on projects, genuinely supporting each other, building something tangible together. Not to mention the close proximity five days a week, eating together, showering together, sleeping together. Taken together, they have fulfilled the three requirements for a relationship to flourish – equality, proximity, and intimacy. Equality, parties respect each other and bring value to the relationship in their unique capacities; proximity, parties spend time together and meaningfully interact with each other; intimacy, parties express their affection for each other.I would want to elaborate more on intimacy. When people think of intimacy, they immediately assume this means physical intimacy and more specifically sexual intercourse. However, intimacy is about expressions of affection. There are many ways to express affection, not just physically. And physical expressions of affection aren’t just limited to sex, take a leaf from this couple’s playbook.Acknowledging the environment that they are in, this pair expresses their affection discreetly and in very thoughtful ways. It comes in simply and constantly – one party waiting for the other to finish his task before taking their meals together. It comes sweetly and discreetly – in the clasping of hands when they think others aren’t watching. It comes fleetingly and attentively – in always looking for each other and smiling when the eyes meet.In such a hostile environment, these two individuals are able to grow and develop together, forming a relationship that is more than the sum of their substantial parts. Secret, commendable and beautiful, their opening chapter might have been written in NS but we’ll await the day they complete this magnum opus.Having been months since they’ve left the Army, I miss them, I really do.-#96263: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96263",27,16,0,13,5,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

#96250,17/3/2021,"Am I the ass for being upset at the way my girlfriend handled my birthday?One month before my birthday, I told her it was a big year for me and I am very excited about it. I asked if she is willing to take leave on that day to spend it with me and it will mean a lot to me. She suddenly snapped at me and said I have no right to ask her to do that and got so unproprotionaly angry that I was hurt and confused. Including rollover she has 30 unused leave days this year and has no upcoming travel plans. I got an entire lecture from her on how it is her right on how to use her leave days. I found this whole talk on ""rights"" super turn-off.Two weeks before my birthday she told me she will bake a cake for my birthday. Then three days before my birthday she said she forgot to get the ingredients, can I keep the whole day empty and she tell me on the day itself if she can bake a cake for me? I thought this was somewhat quite selfish of her to expect this because if she cannot then it is too late for me to make alternative plans but I said okay. One day before my birthday she told me she won't be able to bake a cake for my birthday but will make it up to me and bake the cake a week later, instead on my birthday she will come after work and have dinner with me at my place ordering takeaway food. I said okay.She surprised me by coming a few hours later at 11.30pm just before my birthday after I had already gone to bed to surprise me with a slice of cake she dabao earlier in the day, and left an hour later, telling me she will come back to my place for dinner. While it was a nice surprise, it did mess up my sleep cycle as I usually sleep and wake up early. When I woke up though on my birthday, I got a message from her, saying I am free anyway since I took leave on my birthday so I should be the one traveling to her place to celebrate my birthday and not the other way round. She said this despite one month ago I already told her I wish to just stay home on my birthday this year. I told her I wished she could be more reliable especially given the context and she proceeded to spend the next 3 hours on a work day for her, screaming at me, and tearing me to shreds, on my birthday itself. She told me not only is she definitely not coming, she will not be baking a birthday cake for me a week later as ""it does not spark joy for her"".I said you left me hanging, and systematically ruined a super important birthday for me step by step, until the day itself, when it was too late for me to make any alternative plans. She denies all responsibilty and proceeds to gaslight me. Even a week later, she still says it is completely my fault. Her logic and defense now is that she gave me the option to travel to her place at a time of her choosing (she will tell me 30 minutes before she is free so could be anytime between 5pm and 11pm) on my birthday and because I chose not to take this option, it is completely my fault for ruining my own birthday. She said she did her best and hence she is not sorry at all and I have no right to expect her to be sorry. Gosh, another ""rights"" thing going on.To add some detail, she also neither got me a card nor a gift on my birthday. I asked this in passing (it is not the most important thing to me but it would have been nice) and she said what for, not like I got her anything for hers, which is not true at all. I forwarded her back her old message thanking me for the gift and card I got her for her birthday, saying how touched she is. She defended herself by saying oh of course she remembers those things are from me, just that she forgot it is a birthday gift, as she uses them every week.She is so sure that I am in the wrong and not her, that I am left feeling confused, hence I am hoping others here can share their thoughts from an outsider's perspective. For me I am very hurt and upset. Should I be? Or am I over thinking and over sensitive?

#96248,17/3/2021,"As a girl, are you okay with your bf liking the photos of other pretty girls on social media, assuming these are girls he does not know in real life?Recently my bf is trying to become an influencer on social media. I understand that starting out is difficult and you have to like and follow others to start getting any traction at all. That does not change the fact that he is liking photos of girls with shapely bodies or wearing very little clothes which I feel is so disrespectful to me. Despite not direct messaging them, he still replies to them publicly when they leave comments on his posts, which makes me really upset. I have spoken to my girl friends and all of them share the same views as me, comforted me, and encouraged me to speak with my bf. They all believe he is firmly in the wrong.However when I spoke to him, he was enraged that I went to talk to others about him, instead of going directly to him first. He is also upset that I am questioning his loyalty and says that while I was busy suspecting him and badmouthing him to others, he has been busy doing things for me, planning surprises for me and buying things for me. He was truthful that he was doing all these but still when I asked him to delete his social media accounts or at the very minimum, unfollow all girls, he refused, which to me is a major major red flag.Since we started dating, he has always been loyal to me but I cannot get over the fact that he is my first and he has had many exes before me.

#96246,17/3/2021,"Does anyone else have experience with dating an emotional vampire?What do I mean by that? Well for instance my gf likes to call me out of the blue for 1-2 hours each time, not caring whether I am busy or not. But after each call, it never leaves me energized, rather I feel emotionally drained, stressed, exhausted, hurt, and need hours to recover each time.When we meet in person, no matter how much effort I put in, she gets angry over the tiniest things and ruin everything. For instance I might have spent upwards of 10 hours planning something for her, and we are having the best day ever, doing everything she enjoys, and all expenses on me. On the way home, I tapped my key card to open the house gate downstairs, she was next to it and didn't even bother opening it, nvm I open it for her but let go of the gate 1 second too early because she was reading messages on her phone instead of walking and the gate hit her ankle, she screamed at me for 30 minutes straight and cold war me for the rest of the night. It makes me feel like every meeting with her is doomed anyway and I am just taken for granted.There are two other things in our relationship which infuriate me a lot. The first is that she is a very suspicious person and will invent all sorts of weird thoughts I never had and blame me for them. For example she might think I like another girl whom I don't even know and then I will have to spend the next five hours convincing her that is not true. I find I waste so much of my time defending myself about thoughts I never had.The other thing which infuriates me a lot is what makes things even worse. Not only is she lost in her own mind thinking weird thoughts about me, she does not even hear what I actually say to her! Let's say she gets angry at me and raises a concern, I will respond to it with an explanation or a question. However, she won't even bother to hear what I have to say, she will just scream over me such that neither of us can hear anything, and repeat herself up to twenty or more times in a row. I never understood why. It is like she does not actually want to hear what I have to say, it is like she doesn't want to resolve anything, it is like she just wants to rant and cut me down. Even if I patiently listen to her for a good twenty minutes, the moment she finished and I open my mouth, she will cut me off even before I can finish my first sentence.Somehow my gf is thoroughly convinced and I can tell she really believes this instead of just saying it, that she is a good, kind, thoughtful, considerate, sweet person, despite abusing me this way. In 2.5 years of dating, she has never owned any fault for any of our quarrels or fights before and will not let go until I apologize for everything, even in situations when it is almost all or entirely her fault. She repeats her belief so much that I often even fall for it, but when I sit down and try to think things throughly rationally, I am like wait a minute, how can this be true?Even though she is an abusive emotional vampire, I love her a lot. Things did not start out this way and at the start I did think she was a very nice and fun person. She has become a part of my life and while she is causing so much havoc and chaos, it is difficult for me to imagine life without her. It's like suffering or suffering the two options for me.

The guys are either not ready to settle down, just playing around or making used of me, not sure what they want in love.

I do not wish to disappoint my grandma as she told me she wish to see me married before she passed away. I really do not know what to do and need some suggestions. I am open to hear, thank you.-#96243: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96243",19,3,0,8,0,22,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#96242,17/3/2021,"With all the hate on small dicks these days, and that most men probably suffer from insecurities with their size, I would like to chime in as an ex sex addict/veteran who probably had over 50 sex partners ranging from hookers, escorts, fwbs and ex-gfs, and got by with an average or below average penis judging from how sizes get way inflated online. 1) It is probably common knowledge that vaginas come in different sizes, but tightness is a skill that can be trained. The best sex I had was with a caucasian escort who was really skilled at gripping my penis and making me climax real quickly. On the contrary, the worst sex I had was on a drunk hookup where the girl basically just spread her legs and expected all the work from me. It was a frustrating session that I couldn’t even cum after 2 hours. So ladies, please get good at tightening your vaginas and stop complaining about your man’s size.2) Well dude, if the lady you are having sex with doesn’t want to work on that and you desire tightness, I realized from experience that women who are chubbier tend to have them a lot more snug and warmer by default. 3) Explore sex positions that allow for deeper penetration and experiment with how certain hip placement makes her feel tighter. I wouldn’t go into detail about this as there should be ample resources online on this topic.4) Stop watching so much porn (Applies to both men and women). This creates unrealistic expectations of manhood size for women, and also creates problems such as erectile dysfunction for men. Yup, what’s the use of a big penis or a grower if it never gets rock hard? The ability to open many tabs and search for different kinks with a few clicks would desensitize you from real sex. Real sex is sweaty, and can smell funky from all the vaginal fluids too.-#96242: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96242",30,19,0,0,35,72,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
#96227,17/3/2021,"Hi , I'm 20 and consider myself straight. But I met this gay guy at school (age 21) and we really got on. We made fast buddies and I admit I did strangely find him attractive. He's taller than me, lean, thick dark hair, and super- blue eyes. The first hint that something was up was when we were in the shower cubicle at the campus gym and I saw him naked. It totally turned me on. Fortunately, I had my pants on because there was definitely an erection. So some time goes by and we hang out (and yeah, in between I did jerk off imagining him). Then one night about a few months ago I was over at his house and we were watching a movie. We were sitting pretty close together and I felt inclined to hold his hand so I reached over and took it. He didn't even seem surprised, though I did notice a smirk on his face. Anyway, he didn't pull away and we just sat there holding hands for awhile. Then we sort of glanced at each other, and he leaned forward and kissed me. Then I kissed him back and we made out on his couch (at some point we were even lying down, him on top of me, and that got me even more turned on). He led me by the hand to his bedroom, we took each other's clothes off, and had sex (everything short of anal since I was not prepared for that in more ways than one). And I was confused but pretty happy, and it was honestly better than any sex I've ever had with a girl (though my experience in that arena is rather limited). I ended up spending the night with him. From that point on, our interactions changed. When greeting each other, we kiss, I spend a few nights a week at his place.My roommate (who is also gay) walked in to our apartment once and found me with my head in his lap and him stroking my hair. Afterwards, my roommate referred to him as my boyfriend, and I had to correct him, because again, I'm straight, but I feel strongly connected with him and enjoy spending time close to him. But then last night my sister asked how things were going with my boyfriend. She said it jokingly, but it's starting to make me self- conscious. Am I misinterpreting this relationship, and we're more than just close buddies who periodically have fun? Is it possible I'm not straight, or do no other straight guys feel comfortable doing stuff like this? Any advice?-#96227: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96227",131,76,0,0,80,87,0,0,12,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
#96226,17/3/2021,"I am the one who write on confession #96104. First of all, i sincerely apologise for all the paragraph and English that is not type properly. Also all the headache and eating of panadol to some people that I have cause. Let me change on the phasing and English.I was in a 6 years relationship. Due to my family objection on our relationship, we have to break up. I have been arguing with my family because of this relationship. Despite how much I try to convince my family, this relationship is worth, they will still comment "" if you think is worth than go ahead but end of the day even if I marry will end up divorce"". Additionally, for the pass few month, after I choose to proceed with the relationship and tell my family on my plan to have house and marry, they will either ignore my words or find way to stop me or give me very stastic answer. The main reason why my family feel that this bf is not worth together, they feel that he do not have proper job. starting when he work freelance, they feel he had no stable cpf. After I try to convince him to work full time job, my family got no objection. moving forward, after he work for 1 years plus, he feel stress and resign without finding job. when my family know about this, they don't like and start with their objection on this relationship again. Despite all this,  I try to hold on to this long 6 years relationship, I try to talk to my bf to solve on the issue we have. Told him why future is important, he mentioned he just want to work no stress work and he feel that his parent can go through this last time so he can do the same too. Whatever he say I could endure and willing to find way to overcome to maintain this 6 years rs. But recently when I ask him to try to convince my parent to accept him, he told me if I cannot convince, he convince also no use. why need to be so unhappy as family is important. Long story short,  me and the bf officially broke up recently as he not willing to convince my family despite how much I could accept that he want to work no stress job and have no much plan for future. I feel quite emotional of this rs since we have been together for sometime. I just hope to get some advice to hold on to fight for this rs or move on to another person. Seeking advice. # Lastly, I saw some of the previous comment on bread is important and ask me to move on. Thankful for those that actually comment and give me advice despite my earlier post with a lot of paragraph and language issue.

#96222,17/3/2021,"Is catfishing supposed to be super common on dating apps? I've started using dating apps recently, but I must say that the few people I've met look really different from their pics, not in the nice way. Personally, I know where I stand and I'm not very choosy myself, and I would have still went out with them to get to know each other better if they used an accurate pic. However, if the norm is to catfish and expect catfishing, I can't help but feel like I'm underselling myself and getting screened out by others because I look the same in person.-#96222: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96222",12,0,0,0,2,7,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
#96217,17/3/2021,"I got together with my current bf just two months ago. Yesterday he said something and I am really not sure if I can accept his views so want to ask people here for a more unbiased perspective.He said he can't really accept that I often wear clothes with plunging necklines showing a lot of cleavage, sometimes wearing bikinis which show underboob or sideboob, and often go braless or wear very thin bras and thus my nipples sometimes show a bit through my tops. He said that being single and being in a relationship is different and that I should respect him more and dress more conservatively now that I am in a relationship with him.My view is that my body is my own and how I dress is really none of his business. I am also only young once and it's not like I will be able to dress like this and still look good when I get old so why not do this while I still can. I think he is overstepping his boundaries and being overly possessive while he thinks I am disrespecting him and the relationship.Who is right?-#96217: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96217",164,15,0,0,29,68,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

#96209,17/3/2021,"Hi admin, please post this...I need to hear opinion from others so I can decide on the next step of my career. With all the previous posts about pharmacy-related matters, I’m currently working in one of the statutory boards. We were also given side projects, which the boss mentioned “it would be good if you could take it up”. I would have interpreted this as not compulsory for me to take them up if I don’t wish to. The other colleagues also told me that I don’t have to take up these side projects if I’m not aiming for promotion. Apparently, our main job is already quite hectic, so these side projects can only be done outside of office hours. Furthermore, we don’t get paid for OT and neither are we allowed time-off even if we were to stay back and do these extra stuff. Just to clarify, I like this job enough to do in the long term, but not enough for me to sacrifice my free time to work more as my main priority is work-life balance.Thus, I can say that I’m indeed not aiming for promotion as my current priority is work-life balance, so I decided that I’ll just do my main job and ignored all side projects. As a result, the boss seems unhappy with me. Recently, I felt like my direct superior is pushing me to take up a side project via the passive aggressive way eg chasing me for the results every now and then and asking me to hurry, even though I was already very busy with my main job. Obviously I would prioritise my main job and leave the side project to the last minute as the project is supposedly optional. So my question is this: is it actually an unspoken rule that one is expected to take up some side projects, even if you’re not aiming for promotion? Or it depends on the boss one has?-#96209: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96209",9,1,0,5,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

#96203,17/3/2021,"Hi everyone,I am about to graduate from NUS computing. It took me until graduation to discover my interest in finance and economics specifically investment-related. I used to study accounting back before university but did not have such a strong interest/passion for it back then. Other than that, I have passed M5, M9, M9a, HI exams in my previous pursuit to become a financial consultant (long story short, it didn't work out and I didn't like the style of work). I have been reading up a lot on investment on my own and I would say I know the basics though I do not have much investment experience yet.Is there any entry-level investment-related roles I can take that can allow me to have some working experience and gain more relevant knowledge? Or is there any route you can recommend for me to take? I do not mind doing research or other excel spreadsheet types of tasks as an initial entry into the industry. My idea is to accumulate experience and knowledge to be able to eventually be promoted to higher roles. Recently, I saw some jobs as an investment analyst/associate which recommend employees to take the CFA exam within 2-3 years. I know that CFA is known to have a lower passing rate than other certificate-based examinations. What are your thoughts/personal experience on this?

#96192,17/3/2021,"My boyfriend and I have a huge difference in sleeping patterns and ever since I started working full time, I feel like it’s beginning to take a toll on our relationship. He has the habit of sleeping at wee hours in the morning (5-6am) whereas I am usually asleep by 12am. This means that he only wakes up around 2-3pm (even on days we plan to meet) and by that time, half the day is over for me, since I have to get up early the next day for work. Our weekly dates have since become super routine, in a sense that we only spend about 2 hours just hanging out before having dinner and then going home. It makes me feel as if I am the one causing our dates to be like this since I have to be home early. I have spoken to him about the issue but he feels that it is not a problem and he always promises to fix his sleep schedule but never does it. There was once we made plans to meet at 11am and  he only woke up at 2pm. I was pretty angry because I made the effort to be there on time only to feel like I was being stood up. And when he finally woke up, he didn’t understand why I was so angry as it was just a small matter to him. Sometimes I even think back and wonder why I was so dumb to actually continue waiting there for 3 hours - until he called back. I have no idea if such a difference is a red flag? Or a sign that maybe we are really not that compatible.. or I am just not important enough for him to compromise-#96192: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96192",31,11,0,0,3,33,0,9,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

Why only teach theory stuff that only those who venture into research will find useful? After your graduate, many of these theories that you learn will be forgotten anyway.

#96187,17/3/2021,"To #96179, #96157 and #96177I've only had about 2 ex bfs and I'm now engaged. My fiancé is definitely smaller than my second exbf (A), but he's still bigger than my first ex (.My sex life is still decent now, I occasionally don't fake it - but I still end up pretty unsatisfied most of the time compared to when I was with A. At the risk of TMI, A was unreasonably large that some days that it would be hard to fit him. Think something like 6""+ on an average day. In comparison, my fiancé is a little around half of A. You can go figure how sad my first sexual experiences with B were from that.The thing is, even though the sex isn't that great, I'd still say I'm keeping him for his other redeeming qualities. I figure that he as a person is exactly my type of person and he in specific is the person I want to marry. He's not rich, doesn't earn that much above average, but he's a great guy and I'll stand by him.I do agree that I'm less willing to initiate or agree to sex with my fiance since I don't particularly find it very enjoyable, and I find my sex drive has kinda tapered off over the course of this relationship. Don't get why people are so up in arms about someone saying that they're not like, *super enthusiastic* over an activity they don't really enjoy. We don't have sex that often but we do other things together and overall have a good time in each others' company.I guess it depends on whether you can look past the sex life, or if it's really that much of a dealbreaker for you. For me it felt like 80% of the relationship at first, since the contrast to A was really quite obvious in terms of frequency and enjoyment, but eventually I guess we found other things to do that made up for it in the long term. I can't say that it's 20% of the relationship now, even after 7 going on 8 years, but I guess we have to work towards it. And anyway I got together with him for who he is and not what his member feels like.I'll state the obvious - if you're not happy in the relationship, and if you think something in the relationship isn't working, it's fair enough to break up. The relationship is about both of you, so if someone is unhappy and can't work past that unhappiness, the relationship won't work in the long run anyway. I'd caution against talking to your boyfriends about this, since this isn't exactly a problem that can be ""solved"", if you do want to bring it up, please be sensitive about it and try not to hurt their egos when talking about it.Good luck and may you find happiness, sis!-#96187: https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/96187",11,4,0,3,7,45,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
