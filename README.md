# NUSWhispers Explorer Web Application
Web Application: https://nuswhispers-explorer.herokuapp.com/

***Note: The web application might not load due to exceeding the free dyno hours usually towards end of a month.**

## Project Description
As an avid NUSWhispers reader, I wanted to know what are the top confessions for each month based on the reactions. As such, I wrote a web scraping script to scrape from [NUSWhispers Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nuswhispers/) site to gather the reactions from the readers. 
In addition to the reactions, I wanted to know the main category those confessions fall into and found that [NUSWhispers Main Website](https://nuswhispers.com/home/) provide such information. 
After combining the scrape results from these two websites, I created a Flask web application and hosted it on heroku.
